Today, I'm thrilled to announce we_e leading the Series B for BVNK. Joining us in this round are Coinbase, Tiger Global, and many other institutional, and angel investors. 

We believe stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in financial rails of the past few decades, and BVNK is a global leader in stablecoin payment infrastructure.

With the stablecoin market now processing $25.1 trillion annually, we believe their momentum to be undeniable. Legacy systems like SWIFT and SEPA, built decades ago, no longer seem sufficient to meet the demands of a fast-moving, interconnected global economy. Meanwhile, stablecoins offer a stepwise change in speed, transparency, and cost efficiency.
BVNK is not just participating in this transformation_t_ helping to lead the way.

The promise of crypto has long been to build faster, fairer, and more inclusive financial systems. BVNK is creating infrastructure that bridges the gap between fiat and stablecoin ecosystems, thereby enabling  businesses like Deel, Rapyd, and Trust Payments, to send, receive, and settle payments seamlessly, regardless of currency or geography.

We_e thrilled to partner with @donald_jackson @jessehs @chrisharmse89, and the entire BVNK team as they continue to expand their global footprint, bringing internet-speed payments to businesses worldwide. This team has been building for over five years, through multiple crypto cycles, and brings real business building skills to this challenge. Their growth has been commensurate with their skills, and we_e excited to help them tackle new markets.

We_e just at the beginning of this new payment era, and BVNK will be a key player in this next chapter, working to redefine how money moves globally. Sounds interesting? Join in on the fun -> @BVNKFinance",2024-12-17 15:06:00+00:00,8.0,12.0,151.0,199.0

Today, I'm thrilled to announce we_e leading the Series B for BVNK. Joining us in this round are Coinbase, Tiger Global, and many other institutional, and angel investors. 

We believe stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in financial rails of the past few decades, and BVNK is a global leader in stablecoin payment infrastructure.

With the stablecoin market now processing $25.1 trillion annually, we believe their momentum to be undeniable. Legacy systems like SWIFT and SEPA, built decades ago, no longer seem sufficient to meet the demands of a fast-moving, interconnected global economy. Meanwhile, stablecoins offer a stepwise change in speed, transparency, and cost efficiency.
BVNK is not just participating in this transformation_t_ helping to lead the way.

The promise of crypto has long been to build faster, fairer, and more inclusive financial systems. BVNK is creating infrastructure that bridges the gap between fiat and stablecoin ecosystems, thereby enabling  businesses like Deel, Rapyd, and Trust Payments, to send, receive, and settle payments seamlessly, regardless of currency or geography.

We_e thrilled to partner with @donald_jackson @jessehs @chrisharmse89, and the entire BVNK team as they continue to expand their global footprint, bringing internet-speed payments to businesses worldwide. This team has been building for over five years, through multiple crypto cycles, and brings real business building skills to this challenge. Their growth has been commensurate with their skills, and we_e excited to help them tackle new markets.

We_e just at the beginning of this new payment era, and BVNK will be a key player in this next chapter, working to redefine how money moves globally. Sounds interesting? Join in on the fun -> @BVNKFinance",2024-12-17 15:06:00+00:00,8.0,12.0,151.0,199.0

When transformative technologies like crypto and AI come along, we should first try to understand their essence  examining the full range of possibilities they unlock, both good and bad  and then design policies that promote positive outcomes while minimizing risks. As I wrote in Read Write Own:

The way to see the truth is to separate the essence of a technology from specific uses and misuses of it. A hammer can build a home, or it can demolish one. Nitrogen-based fertilizers help grow crops that feed billions of people, but they can also be used in explosives. Stock markets help societies allocate capital and resources where they can be most productive, but they also enable destructive speculative bubbles. All technologies have the capacity to help or harm... the question is, how can we maximize the good while minimizing the bad?

The wrong way to approach new technologies is to shoehorn old policies into the new era using lawsuits and piecemeal rule making. These reactive approaches create uncertainty, fragment rules across jurisdictions, and take years or even decades to resolve. The previous administration's legal campaign against crypto demonstrated the flaws of this approach, failing both policy-wise and politically.

Emerging industries can only be built on stable foundations. The internet was built on forward-thinking congressional legislation, including most prominently the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This created a cohesive national framework that persisted across multiple administrations and set a model for other countries to follow. As a result, the internet flourished, and the US led in its development. 

Today we are at a similar crossroads. We are now, finally, experiencing the big payoff of roughly 80 years of computing: accelerating progress in crypto, AI, biotech, robotics, and more.

2025-01-23,positive,"Other than Adam Back and any known cypherpunks who worked on Bitcoin from it's earliest stages, Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) is actually the elder statesman of all crypto creators and devs of any Layer 1 crypto that is still relevant and used today throughout the entire world.

He's invested in many of the earliest Bitcoin companies you know still today, let the public decide Litecoin's launch date and time, and fully divested of Litecoin specifically to make sure anything he does to promote and work on it can never be construed as done for personal gain.

He's been the mediator for fair deals on tough situations that affect everyone from Vitalik Buterin to many others, with little to no recognition from any of these people for his efforts, including the block size wars. Charlie even saw the security issues with Dogecoin early on and offered to have it merge mined with Litecoin to save it from 51% attacks.

He should be on any short list of advisors for a crypto working group, and Litecoin should be absolutely added as digital silver to any crypto stockpile. He will probably never say this publicly that he should be considered because that's just the way he is. Which is what I love about him as a co-director and as a friend. But anyone who truly agrees with what I'm saying, let him know how much we need him now more than ever before.

He's probably not going to be happy with me when he reads this, but I can't sit by anymore and see other projects potentially pay their way into the limelight, onto advisory committees, and most likely into any US crypto stockpile without my mentioning the fact both he and Litecoin absolutely need to be involved at the highest levels.

The U.S. seems to be turning its combative stance on blockchains and crypto toward a more supportive one that offers guidance and clarity on the rules for builders to follow. While it_ still early, a number of encouraging steps have already been taken across government toward that end. New leadership, new rules, new task forces  all of these help give the crypto industry something that it has sorely lacked: a meaningful path forward.

Whereas recent years were marked by lawsuits against startups, turf wars between regulatory agencies, angry letters from lawmakers, incidents of debanking, and regulation-by-enforcement, the past few weeks signal a much more optimistic, pro-tech approach. From the White House, we_e seen the appointment of an AI & Crypto Czar and an executive order declaring support for blockchain development. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a new crypto task force and repealed Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a damaging rule that had held back crypto development. And in both houses of Congress, prominent legislators have indicated a willingness to enshrine clear rules of the road for the industry in legislation.

To foster the conversation between government officials and blockchain experts, we_e gathered 11 views from industry experts on issues ranging from taxes and the freedom to stake, to broader issues like encouraging decentralization and reforming the U.S. regulatory regime.

It_ time to fix it.

Decentralization should mean the absence of control, not the suppression of ongoing efforts.

Here_ how and why_

Network tokens  tokens that derive substantial value from the operation of a blockchain (eg BTC, ETH, SOL)  can have embedded trust dependencies that result in information asymmetries. 

Where those trust dependencies are minimized, network tokens look like commodities with low information asymmetry risk. 

Where those trust dependencies are significant, network tokens can look like securities with high information asymmetry risk  supporting the use of disclosures requirements under securities laws.

The two primary trust dependencies relating to network tokens are: (1) control and (2) ongoing efforts.
The SEC_ 2019 Decentralization Framework sought to eliminate the risk of information asymmetries by defining decentralization to mean the absence of BOTH control and ongoing efforts. Their reasoning was clear  where network tokens were _ufficiently decentralized tokens functioned more like commodities.

But this is the wrong approach! 

It_ created significant perverse incentives  builders can actually reduce their regulatory risk by abandoning their projects or by masking their ongoing efforts (_ecentralization theater). 

Builders HATE this conception of decentralization.

We need to incentivize builders, not hinder them. A better two-pronged approach can achieve this:

1_ecentralization should be redefined as _he absence of control. This eliminates significant risk and preserves one of the core features of blockchains  they can function without human control. 

2_ targeted and light touch disclosure framework can be used to eliminate information asymmetries that might arise from ongoing efforts.

Collectively, this approach would foster innovation and protect users  ensuring decentralization empowers builders rather than being weaponized against them.

Today at Acelera, @CamiRusso, founder of @DefiantNews, led a session on Mastering Web3 Storytelling, focusing on how to craft compelling narratives, build a strong brand, and communicate effectively with the press. She began by sharing her background in traditional media and the experience of launching The Defiant.

To break the ice, Cami presented a common dilemma for startups: should founders handle communications themselves or delegate them to PR? The first approach, she explained, suggests that creators should directly communicate their vision, respond quickly to controversies, and shape public perception, building direct relationships with the press. On the other hand, the Media & PR-Led approach, as Cami noted, prioritizes media coverage, enhances reputation and trust, ensures clear messaging, prevents missteps and strategically managed crises_hich allows founders to focus on growth.

Instead of choosing one strategy over the other, Cami recommended a hybrid model: _ounder Heart, PR Head. The founder should drive the emotional side of the story, communicating the company_ vision, mission, and values to build trust. Meanwhile, PR professionals should focus on media relationships, ensuring that messaging is strategic and newsworthy.

Cami then explained what makes a story truly newsworthy. Timeliness, impact, and novelty play key roles, as do prominence, conflict, human interest, and relevance to current trends. She also stressed the importance of proximity and niche appeal, which make a story more compelling to specific audiences.

She highlighted what journalists look for, emphasizing exclusive news, reliable sources, and underreported industry trends. At the same time, she warned against overwhelming them with irrelevant announcements, enforcing embargoes only to see other outlets publish first, or pressuring them to change a story when there are no factual inaccuracies.

When pitching to the press, Cami advised focusing on being useful and building relationships._ She emphasized the importance of understanding what it means to be on and off the record_hat it_ not just a casual conversation between friends, but a journalist_ job. That_ why it_ crucial to be clear about what we do or don_ want to be published. Even when there_ a broader narrative behind the story, it_ key to provide the journalist with off-the-record context and keep quotes short to ensure they stay as true as possible to the perspective we want to highlight.

The talk ended with a Q&A, where Cami offered tailored advice to teams on handling media communications. She encouraged Acelera founders to focus on building first and engage with the press once they have a live product and active users.

The most important development was the president_ announcement that he wants stablecoin and market structure legislation passed by August. Industries are built on solid foundations, and this is a critical step forward.

Transformative technologies like crypto and AI require us to separate their essence from specific uses and misuses.

2025-03-08,all,"It was an honor to attend the crypto summit at the White House on Friday. The last administration chose to wage a lawfare campaign against good actors while mostly ignoring bad ones. The new administration is pursuing a much smarter approach: providing a clear pathway for entrepreneurs and innovation while ensuring strong consumer protections.

The most important development was the president_ announcement that he wants stablecoin and market structure legislation passed by August. Industries are built on solid foundations, and this is a critical step forward.

Transformative technologies like crypto and AI require us to separate their essence from specific uses and misuses. A hammer can build a home or demolish one; the question is how we maximize the good while minimizing the bad. Reactive approaches_ike lawsuits and piecemeal rulemaking_reate uncertainty and fragmentation. The internet flourished because of forward-thinking legislation like the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which created a cohesive national framework.

Today, we_e at a similar crossroads.

But I still don't see how all this L2 activity gets reflected on Ethereum mainnet. Layer 2s are getting Ethereum security for free right now, only paying for block space, which they will pay even less for with larger blobs. 

I know lots of ethereans are triggered when people say Layer 2s are parasitic, and I get that Ethereum couldn't scale without them, so of course l2s are a net positive to the Ethereum ecosystem. But right now it doesn't seem like their contributions match the benefits they're getting.

2025-03-13,negative,"I think this is what everyone is feeling and I disagree to an extend but nevertheless the situation is tricky.

Currently Ethereum is making almost zero fees from both L1 and L2 transactions *because it chooses to*: If we were a company, we would put a reasonable price tag on transactions, and raise it when there is congestion. But instead, we currently charge very close to zero for transactions and DA when there is no congestion, and the result is there is almost zero fees. Looks bad when you want to evaluate Ether based on that!

But here comes the more tricky part: In its current form, it may well be that Ethereum DA does not have much of a moat. It provides very little UX benefits, and only very abstract security benefits that will probably be very closely replicated by alt-DA. Therefore, the moat for DA is low and it's likely Ethereum will never charge significant fees over a long time period.

So what should be the plan? My best guess is:
 - scale L1 to make sure that integration with Ethereum remains attractive
 - scale DA to make sure that we lower the incentives for alt-DA (this doesn't have to mean lower fees. We can just charge a fee!)
 - work on shorter block times, single-slot L2 interop etc. to maximize value of Ethereum DA",2025-03-13 20:09:00+00:00,127.0,107.0,817.0,1412.0

2025-03-13,all,"I think this is what everyone is feeling and I disagree to an extend but nevertheless the situation is tricky.

Currently Ethereum is making almost zero fees from both L1 and L2 transactions *because it chooses to*: If we were a company, we would put a reasonable price tag on transactions, and raise it when there is congestion. But instead, we currently charge very close to zero for transactions and DA when there is no congestion, and the result is there is almost zero fees. Looks bad when you want to evaluate Ether based on that!

But here comes the more tricky part: In its current form, it may well be that Ethereum DA does not have much of a moat. It provides very little UX benefits, and only very abstract security benefits that will probably be very closely replicated by alt-DA. Therefore, the moat for DA is low and it's likely Ethereum will never charge significant fees over a long time period.

So what should be the plan? My best guess is:
 - scale L1 to make sure that integration with Ethereum remains attractive
 - scale DA to make sure that we lower the incentives for alt-DA (this doesn't have to mean lower fees. We can just charge a fee!)
 - work on shorter block times, single-slot L2 interop etc. to maximize value of Ethereum DA",2025-03-13 20:09:00+00:00,127.0,107.0,817.0,1412.0

But I still don't see how all this L2 activity gets reflected on Ethereum mainnet. Layer 2s are getting Ethereum security for free right now, only paying for block space, which they will pay even less for with larger blobs. 

I know lots of ethereans are triggered when people say Layer 2s are parasitic, and I get that Ethereum couldn't scale without them, so of course l2s are a net positive to the Ethereum ecosystem. But right now it doesn't seem like their contributions match the benefits they're getting. 

This means that even if all of crypto's most successful use cases are on Ethereum Layer 2s, ETH the asset will only partially benefit. I imagine that's why even with all the real adoption happening on Ethereum, ETH just keeps sliding.",2025-03-13 18:46:00+00:00,112.0,30.0,419.0,815.0

2025-03-29,positive,"For ETH, real world growth is the answer.

How do we get ETH to $20k?

Fee value accrual obviously isn't necessary to drive the required public confidence for a high token price, otherwise BTC would be worthless because 99.999% of BTC activity is centralized and doesn't accrue value to bitcoin.

So, while strong value accrual isn't necessary for a high token price, might it be sufficient?

If eth had 18% deflation per year because L1 apps and L2s were burning so much ETH, it's pretty hard to imagine a scenario where this high level of deflation wasn't accompanied by similarly high level of confidence in ETH and thus a high token price. That's why strong value accrual is likely sufficient in practice for a high token price. Ie. it's not that high fees create a high valuation in a cash flow/DCF sense - it doesn't work that way - rather it's because high fees tend to coincide with high confidence in the platform.

Might there be another way to drive confidence besides having high fees? Could we get ETH to $20k without getting back to high total fees?

Maybe we could imagine a scenario where we attracted $1 trillion in stablecoins to the L1, and confidence in ETH moons, but total fees are still low for some reason. This kind of fictitious scenario is highly unrealistic because most kinds of growth will tend to increase fee levels, directly or indirectly. If we attract $1 trillion in stables, fee levels would probably be high already. In fact, a lot of those $1T in stables likely would have joined the platform because of other kinds of growth that increased fee levels.

Ultimately, realistically for ethereum, getting back to high fee levels is both necessary and sufficient to reach a high ETHBTC ratio and moon price for ETH.

One way raise fee levels would be to try to take a knife to our nascent L2 model and carve up some new economics to ""make L2s pay their fair share"". This would be an unwise approach at least because it epitomizes a lack of confidence and impatience in our L2 model.

The other way to raise fees, and the only practical genuine option available to ethereum, is with huge growth.

We need
- more L1 apps (and more distribution of L1 assets/services to all L2s; ""hub AND spokes"")
- more L2s (and more business model diversity)
- more cross-L2 services (see Aztec exporting privacy as a service to other L2s)
- more growth in existing L2s (they're working on it)
- more blobs for L2s to buy (incoming, and an aggressive goal for fusaka this year)
- more L1 blockspace for L1 apps and L2s to buy
- and way more real world builder culture+growth programs for us to get out there, connect with the world, and frontrun the next big areas of opportunity to actually help people and build the ethereum economy

In short, Ethereum does not have a value accrual problem, we have a growth problem. 

Eth mainnet turns 10 this summer. We've come far in our first decade. We're by far the largest chain as measured by app capital and unique integrations/serious apps. That's great, but as this year has shown, we're not nearly done yet.

To get ETH to $20k and Ethereum to global ubiquity, the time is now to 100x our focus on real world growth.

Only real world growth will actually grow ethereum, restore high fees, and send ETH to the moon. LFG",2025-03-29 20:09:00+00:00,60.0,78.0,549.0,885.0

- more growth in existing L2s (they're working on it)
- more blobs for L2s to buy (incoming, and an aggressive goal for fusaka this year)
- more L1 blockspace for L1 apps and L2s to buy
- and way more real world builder culture+growth programs for us to get out there, connect with the world, and frontrun the next big areas of opportunity to actually help people and build the ethereum economy

In short, Ethereum does not have a value accrual problem, we have a growth problem. 

Eth mainnet turns 10 this summer. We've come far in our first decade. We're by far the largest chain as measured by app capital and unique integrations/serious apps. That's great, but as this year has shown, we're not nearly done yet.

To get ETH to $20k and Ethereum to global ubiquity, the time is now to 100x our focus on real world growth.

Only real world growth will actually grow ethereum, restore high fees, and send ETH to the moon. LFG",2025-03-29 20:09:00+00:00,60.0,78.0,549.0,885.0

2025-04-08,neutral,"_@Grok: I've analyzed all tweets from the X account @100trillionUSD, which belongs to PlanB, a former institutional investor and well-known figure in the Bitcoin community famous for creating the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Based on the available data as of April 8, 2025 here are my top 10 insights:

1) Bitcoin Optimism and Bullish Sentiment: PlanB consistently expresses a strong belief in Bitcoin's long-term value and growth potential. Tweets often highlight bullish signals, such as price breakouts or on-chain indicators flipping to positive, suggesting an ongoing narrative of Bitcoin entering or continuing a bull market.

2) Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model Advocacy: The S2F model remains a cornerstone of PlanB's analysis. Tweets frequently reference this model to predict Bitcoin prices, with articles and posts citing targets like $55K and $500K, though he adjusts expectations based on new data while maintaining confidence in its predictive power.

3) On-Chain Analysis Focus: Beyond S2F, PlanB relies heavily on on-chain metrics (e.g., realized price, short-term holder price, UTXO age distribution) to assess Bitcoin's market health. This technical approach underscores his tweets, offering followers a data-driven perspective.

4) Geopolitical Commentary: PlanB links Bitcoin to broader geopolitical events, arguing that money printing (QE) and government overreach fuel its necessity. Tweets about BRICS challenging the USD or inflation critiques reflect a worldview where Bitcoin is a hedge against centralized financial systems.

5) Price Volatility Acknowledgment: While optimistic, PlanB acknowledges Bitcoin's volatility. Past tweets note significant drops (e.g., 69K to 20K) and multi-year cycles, framing them as normal within a larger upward trend.

6) Engagement with Community: PlanB interacts with followers, addressing questions about his models, impersonators, or shadowbanning complaints. This suggests a desire to maintain credibility and a connection with his 2.1M followers, though he occasionally takes breaks (e.g., ""off the grid"" periods).

7) Criticism of Fiat Systems: Tweets often critique fiat currencies, central banks, and policies like quantitative easing. He positions Bitcoin as a superior alternative, citing examples like El Salvador_ adoption or potential USD displacement by BRICS currencies.

8) Historical Context: PlanB frequently uses historical Bitcoin data to support his predictions, referencing past bull runs (e.g., 2013, 2017, 2021) or significant events (e.g., Satoshi_ first block message) to draw parallels with current market conditions.

9) Pragmatic Lifestyle Balance: Amid market analysis, PlanB shares personal insights_ike switching off screens during downturns to go running or sailing_ndicating a balanced approach to the emotional rollercoaster of crypto trading.

10) Caution Against Overleveraging: While not a dominant theme in every tweet, PlanB occasionally warns against leverage and counterparty risk (e.g., exchanges), aligning with a conservative, long-term ""HODL"" philosophy rather than speculative trading.

These insights are drawn from the tone, content, and recurring themes in PlanB's tweet, reflecting PlanB_ role as both a Bitcoin evangelist and a technical analyst.

2025-04-09,neutral,"Stablecoins: Payments Without Intermediaries

The internet made information free and global. So why is it still so hard  and expensive  to move money?

The early internet promised a future where anyone could publish, build, or transact without permission. Protocols like email and the web were open and neutral  and they sparked an explosion of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. But somewhere along the way, we veered off course.

Today, the global financial system resembles a patchwork of corporate networks: centralized, closed, and extractive. Behind every transaction is a Rube Goldberg-machine of intermediaries  points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, local banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, card networks, and others  each taking a cut, adding latency, and imposing rules. These networks levy unnecessary taxes on commerce and curb innovation. They turn what should be neutral plumbing into high-friction bottlenecks.

Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, are a way out, a reset  a way to bring the internet_ original vision to money.

The Disruptive Opportunity of Stablecoins

The current payments stack wasn_ built for the internet  it was built for a world rife with fee-taking middlemen (who had been necessary to manage local partnerships, fraud, and operations). Even today, international remittances can cost up to 10% in fees. (A $200 remittance cost 6.62% on average in September 2024.) These aren_ just friction points  they_e effectively regressive taxes on some of the world_ poorest workers. The system we_e inherited is slow, opaque, and exclusionary, and it leaves billions of people underserved or entirely cut off from the global financial system.

For many businesses, the inefficiencies of traditional payments are also massive. Stablecoins could dramatically improve the situation. B2B payments from Mexico to Vietnam take 3-to-7 days to clear and can cost anywhere from $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted, passing through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of whom takes a cut. Stablecoins could bypass legacy systems, like the international SWIFT network and associated clearing and settlement processes, and make such transactions nearly free and instant.

This isn_ theoretical  it_ already happening. Right now, companies like SpaceX are using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries (including by repatriating funds from countries with volatile local currencies, like Argentina and Nigeria). Other companies, like ScaleAI, are using stablecoins to make faster, cheaper payouts to global workforces. Meanwhile, on the B2C side, Stripe is the first widely used service to offer crypto payments and it is already offering 1.5% on checkout  half what incumbents charge. This could drastically improve certain businesses profit margins: As a16z crypto_ @SamBroner has shown, for a very low margin business like a grocery store, a 1.5% improvement could potentially double net income. (And in a competitive, blockchain-based market, I would expect transaction fees to go much lower.)

Unlike the old financial stack, which evolved in silos, stablecoins are global by default. They live on blockchains: open, programmable networks that anyone can build on. There_ no need to negotiate with dozens of banks across borders. You just plug into the network. People are already recognizing the advantages. In 2024, stablecoins moved $15.6 trillion in value, effectively matching Visa_ volume. While that figure mostly represents financial flows (versus retail payments), its magnitude still suggests we_e on the verge of a financial infrastructure shift, one that doesn_ rely on duct-taping 20th-century systems together.

Instead, we can build something new, something truly internet-native  or what Stripe calls _oom-temperature superconductors for financial services, where rather than lossless energy transmission, you get lossless value transmission.

The WhatsApp Moment for Money

Stablecoins are our first real shot at doing for money what email did for communication: make it open, instant, and borderless.

Consider the evolution of text messaging. Before apps like WhatsApp, sending a text across borders meant paying 30 cents per message. Even then, you were lucky if it actually got delivered. Then came internet-native messaging: instant, global, free. Payments are now where messaging was in 2008: Fragmented by borders. Burdened by middlemen. Gatekept by design.

Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains. These systems are programmable, composable, and designed to scale across borders. Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01. (Fees to convert from stablecoins to local currencies can range from as high as 5% to as low as 0%, and prices continue to fall due to competition.)

Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers.

Regulation: From Bottleneck to Breakthrough

It_ tempting to frame regulation as an obstacle  but smart legislation is actually the unlock.

Clear rules of the road for stablecoins and crypto market structure could finally allow these technologies to move out of the sandbox and toward widespread adoption. For years, decentralized finance (DeFi) was trapped in a kind of self-contained, circular, _rypto-for-crypto economy. Not because the tools weren_ useful, but because regulators made it incredibly difficult to bridge into traditional financial systems.

That_ changing. Policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in ways that maintain U.S. competitiveness, protect consumers, and allow innovation to flourish. Thoughtful regulation  like frameworks that differentiate network tokens from security tokens  can protect against bad actors while giving good actors the clarity they need to build. In fact, a forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system. (Congress is hashing out the details as I write.)

Building Public Goods for Everyone_ Benefit

Traditional finance is built on private, closed networks. But the internet showed us the power of open protocols  like TCP/IP and email  to drive global coordination and innovation.

Blockchains are the internet_ native financial layer. They combine the composability of public protocols with the economic strength of private enterprise. They are credibly neutral, auditable, and programmable. Add stablecoins on top and you get something we_e never really had before: open money infrastructure.

Think of it like a public highway system. Private companies can still build the vehicles, the businesses, the roadside attractions. But the roads themselves are neutral and open for everyone.

Blockchain networks and stablecoins are doing more than just cutting fees. They_e enabling new categories of software:

- Programmatic payments between machines: Imagine AI agent-powered marketplaces automatically brokering deals for computer resources and other services.

- Micropayments for media, music, and AI contributions: Imagine setting a budget with some simple rules and leaving it to _mart wallets to disburse the payments.

- Transparent payouts with full audit trails: Imagine using these systems to track spending in government.

- Global commerce without a mess of intermediaries: Imagine settling international transactions instantly at negligible cost  in fact, you don_ have to imagine it as it_ already happening.

The moment for blockchain networks and stablecoins is now: Technology, market demand, and political will are lining up and making these applications a reality. A stablecoin bill could be on the floor this year, and regulatory agencies are weighing frameworks that finally align risk with the right oversight. In the same way that early internet startups were able to thrive once it was clear they wouldn_ be shut down by telcos or copyright lawyers, crypto is ready to cross the chasm from financial experiment to infrastructure backbone, with stablecoins leading the way.

We don_ have to patch the old system. 

We can make a better one.",2025-04-09 22:30:00+00:00,451.0,483.0,2407.0,4726.0

2025-04-09,all,"Stablecoins: Payments Without Intermediaries

The internet made information free and global. So why is it still so hard  and expensive  to move money?

The early internet promised a future where anyone could publish, build, or transact without permission. Protocols like email and the web were open and neutral  and they sparked an explosion of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. But somewhere along the way, we veered off course.

Today, the global financial system resembles a patchwork of corporate networks: centralized, closed, and extractive. Behind every transaction is a Rube Goldberg-machine of intermediaries  points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, local banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, card networks, and others  each taking a cut, adding latency, and imposing rules. These networks levy unnecessary taxes on commerce and curb innovation. They turn what should be neutral plumbing into high-friction bottlenecks.

Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, are a way out, a reset  a way to bring the internet_ original vision to money.

The Disruptive Opportunity of Stablecoins

The current payments stack wasn_ built for the internet  it was built for a world rife with fee-taking middlemen (who had been necessary to manage local partnerships, fraud, and operations). Even today, international remittances can cost up to 10% in fees. (A $200 remittance cost 6.62% on average in September 2024.) These aren_ just friction points  they_e effectively regressive taxes on some of the world_ poorest workers. The system we_e inherited is slow, opaque, and exclusionary, and it leaves billions of people underserved or entirely cut off from the global financial system.

For many businesses, the inefficiencies of traditional payments are also massive. Stablecoins could dramatically improve the situation. B2B payments from Mexico to Vietnam take 3-to-7 days to clear and can cost anywhere from $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted, passing through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of whom takes a cut. Stablecoins could bypass legacy systems, like the international SWIFT network and associated clearing and settlement processes, and make such transactions nearly free and instant.

This isn_ theoretical  it_ already happening. Right now, companies like SpaceX are using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries (including by repatriating funds from countries with volatile local currencies, like Argentina and Nigeria). Other companies, like ScaleAI, are using stablecoins to make faster, cheaper payouts to global workforces. Meanwhile, on the B2C side, Stripe is the first widely used service to offer crypto payments and it is already offering 1.5% on checkout  half what incumbents charge. This could drastically improve certain businesses profit margins: As a16z crypto_ @SamBroner has shown, for a very low margin business like a grocery store, a 1.5% improvement could potentially double net income. (And in a competitive, blockchain-based market, I would expect transaction fees to go much lower.)

Unlike the old financial stack, which evolved in silos, stablecoins are global by default. They live on blockchains: open, programmable networks that anyone can build on. There_ no need to negotiate with dozens of banks across borders. You just plug into the network. People are already recognizing the advantages. In 2024, stablecoins moved $15.6 trillion in value, effectively matching Visa_ volume. While that figure mostly represents financial flows (versus retail payments), its magnitude still suggests we_e on the verge of a financial infrastructure shift, one that doesn_ rely on duct-taping 20th-century systems together.

Instead, we can build something new, something truly internet-native  or what Stripe calls _oom-temperature superconductors for financial services, where rather than lossless energy transmission, you get lossless value transmission.

The WhatsApp Moment for Money

Stablecoins are our first real shot at doing for money what email did for communication: make it open, instant, and borderless.

Consider the evolution of text messaging. Before apps like WhatsApp, sending a text across borders meant paying 30 cents per message. Even then, you were lucky if it actually got delivered. Then came internet-native messaging: instant, global, free. Payments are now where messaging was in 2008: Fragmented by borders. Burdened by middlemen. Gatekept by design.

Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains. These systems are programmable, composable, and designed to scale across borders. Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01. (Fees to convert from stablecoins to local currencies can range from as high as 5% to as low as 0%, and prices continue to fall due to competition.)

Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers.

Regulation: From Bottleneck to Breakthrough

It_ tempting to frame regulation as an obstacle  but smart legislation is actually the unlock.

Clear rules of the road for stablecoins and crypto market structure could finally allow these technologies to move out of the sandbox and toward widespread adoption. For years, decentralized finance (DeFi) was trapped in a kind of self-contained, circular, _rypto-for-crypto economy. Not because the tools weren_ useful, but because regulators made it incredibly difficult to bridge into traditional financial systems.

That_ changing. Policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in ways that maintain U.S. competitiveness, protect consumers, and allow innovation to flourish. Thoughtful regulation  like frameworks that differentiate network tokens from security tokens  can protect against bad actors while giving good actors the clarity they need to build. In fact, a forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system. (Congress is hashing out the details as I write.)

Building Public Goods for Everyone_ Benefit

Traditional finance is built on private, closed networks. But the internet showed us the power of open protocols  like TCP/IP and email  to drive global coordination and innovation.

Blockchains are the internet_ native financial layer. They combine the composability of public protocols with the economic strength of private enterprise. They are credibly neutral, auditable, and programmable. Add stablecoins on top and you get something we_e never really had before: open money infrastructure.

Think of it like a public highway system. Private companies can still build the vehicles, the businesses, the roadside attractions. But the roads themselves are neutral and open for everyone.

Blockchain networks and stablecoins are doing more than just cutting fees. They_e enabling new categories of software:

- Programmatic payments between machines: Imagine AI agent-powered marketplaces automatically brokering deals for computer resources and other services.

- Micropayments for media, music, and AI contributions: Imagine setting a budget with some simple rules and leaving it to _mart wallets to disburse the payments.

- Transparent payouts with full audit trails: Imagine using these systems to track spending in government.

- Global commerce without a mess of intermediaries: Imagine settling international transactions instantly at negligible cost  in fact, you don_ have to imagine it as it_ already happening.

The moment for blockchain networks and stablecoins is now: Technology, market demand, and political will are lining up and making these applications a reality. A stablecoin bill could be on the floor this year, and regulatory agencies are weighing frameworks that finally align risk with the right oversight. In the same way that early internet startups were able to thrive once it was clear they wouldn_ be shut down by telcos or copyright lawyers, crypto is ready to cross the chasm from financial experiment to infrastructure backbone, with stablecoins leading the way.

We don_ have to patch the old system. 

We can make a better one.",2025-04-09 22:30:00+00:00,451.0,483.0,2407.0,4726.0

Takeaways:

Not totally sold on the idea that content coins are different and distinct from memecoins. I think memecoins are a type of ""content coins""
- Memes are content
- The mechanics Jesse describes as unique to ccs, are what I think also happens in memecoins --> some buyers are there to collect, to support, for the lolz, others are there to speculate.

What's different and interesting about this reframing is
- Content coins can be more than memes, they can be a tweet, a picture, a podcast, whatever content. 
Maybe we can start changing the way we interact with content online so that liking or double-tapping turns into buying (even if it's just for pennies). This will allow creators to better monetize their content, and fans to have a chance of sharing the upside if the token takes off / becomes viral.

Finally
People crying because ""base is for everyone"" coin crashed have a point, the Base tweet was ambiguous about what the token was about

David Joel Horowitz was born January 10, 1939 to Phil and Blanche Horowitz in Queens, New York. David was raised in Queens along with his sister Ruth. Phil and Blanche were high school teachers and members of the American Communist Party. Their lives included secret meetings, secret identities and a secret revolutionary plan. As such, they steeped David in Marxist philosophy and world affairs. We sometimes joked that he was the _iger Woods of Communism as he was raised to be the Party_ next great player. He thought that was funny, because like Tiger he never had a choice in the matter. The impact of his upbringing was profound, but David's life would prove to be shaped by his own self-described irrational desire to _ave the world. While this impulse began as a highly abstract concept, David would spend a lifetime refining it, sharpening it, completely revising it and ultimately making it his life_ mission.

David attended Bryant High School in Queens, NY. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University in 1959 majoring in English. He then earned a master's degree in English literature from University of California, Berkeley.

In 1959, he instantly fell in love with and married Elissa Krauthamer. They would have four children: Jonathan Daniel, Sarah Rose, Benjamin Abraham, and Anne Deborah. In 1962, at 23 years old, David wrote and published his first book, Student, which detailed the political activities of students on the UC Berkeley campus. While at Berkeley, David became frustrated with his Shakespeare professor, so he wrote his own lecture series which he delivered and was widely attended by students all across the campus. He eventually published the series in his second book: Shakespeare: an Existential View. This superhuman confidence and ability to back it up would become thematic throughout David_ life.

Later David and Elissa moved to London, England where David studied under Ralph Miliband and became close friends with Isaac Deutscher. Later David would write Deutscher_ biography. Also while in London, in 1965 David wrote The Free World Colossus: A Critique of American Foreign Policy in the Cold War, which became the book that made him a force on the new left.

In 1968, David and Elissa moved the family back to the United States and purchased a home in Berkeley, California where they would raise their four children.

In his continued mission to save the world, in 1968 David became co-editor of the new left magazine Ramparts. While at Ramparts, David developed a close friendship with Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party. As part of their work together, David helped raise money for, and assisted the Panthers with, the running of a school for poor children in Oakland. He later recommended that Newton hire his friend Betty Van Patter as bookkeeper; she was then working for Ramparts. In December 1974, Van Patter's body was found floating in San Francisco Harbor; she had been murdered by the Panthers for knowing too much.

The murder forced David to confront a truth that he had long suspected. It made clear to him that the pursuit of a marxist utopia was a false and unachievable goal. Diabolically, the goal created a religion. The religion then cloaked the movement_ leaders with an invincible moral standing enabling them to commit atrocities with impunity for their own gain. He was horrified that he had been part of it and it caused him to rethink his entire life.

The decision was not easy. His family, friends, and career were all deeply tied to _he movement. If he were to make this change, he would essentially need to start from scratch. So, he stayed away from politics for a while and changed to a neutral career. He became a biographer and journalist. It was a hugely risky move to change careers at 34 years old with a family of 6 in tow.

In a testament to David_ supreme confidence, indomitable will and massive talent, he was an instant success. His first biography The Rockefeller_ An American Dynasty  written with his best friend and long time colleague Peter Collier  was a blockbuster bestseller. Their next biography The Kennedy_ An American Drama was an even bigger success becoming a number 1 New York Times bestseller.

All the while, David kept an eye on and a hand in politics. While he needed a break to sort out his life, nothing in life would deter him from his mission. In 1981, San Francisco Chronicle writer Randy Schiltz tipped David and Peter to a potential epidemic known as AIDS, which was rapidly spreading through the bath houses in San Francisco. Schiltz was concerned that the leaders in the Gay Community were intimidating the medical establishment into covering up the way it was transmitted and therefore keeping the bath houses open, which would cause it to spread out of control . Randy was too terrified to write about it himself as he did not want to be attacked by the community. David, never one to fear anything, took on the story. In 1981, he and Peter published Whitewash: Gay Leaders in California Have Obscured Vital Information About How the AIDS Disease Spreads.

The aggressive reaction to the story (references to the article still call David a _omophobe) reinforced David_ suspicions. If leaders on the left were willing to sacrifice millions of gay lives to preserve their power and orthodoxy, what wouldn_ they do? The article, the experience, and the ocean of death that followed were the final straw in David_ conversion from his Marxist roots to a leading thinker on the right. He formalized his position on March 17, 1985 when he and Peter published Lefties for Reagan in The Washington Post. David departed the left for good.

The change would cost him nearly everything  all of his friends, coverage in the New York Times Book Review (essential for authors at the time), and countless lost earnings. He would have to start all over. But if the world needed saving from his former comrades on the left, that_ exactly what he would do. Later he would note that the right never excommunicated apostates the way he had been abandoned by the left.

He often complained that he had _he rescue gene. For David, this meant nothing animated him more than someone in need of help. He would instantly leap into action, making every phone call, raising every dollar, and doing anything in his power to save that person. The realization that he had been party to the destructive force activated his rescue gene and infused him with an energy that would produce dozens of books, countless public appearances, and nearly nonstop work for the next 4 decades.

In 1996, he captured this saga in his autobiography Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey where he retraced his life_ and political journey.

1998 proved to be a seminal year for David when he met his angel April Mullivain whom he would marry and who, along with her son John Jay, would watch over him until his passing.

In 1998, he also founded The Horowitz Freedom Center, where he recruited an inspired group of new young intellectuals to join his cause. The name _reedom Center meant much more than most ever understood. While David became known for his change in views, in a sense he never changed at all. His personal style represented the place and community from which he came. Even when he wore a suit, he looked like a radical forced into it due to a court date or a wedding. More importantly, his mission to save the world centered around freedom. When David went to rescue people, it was always from oppression imposed by some person or group. Early on, he had been trained to think the rich capitalists were the oppressors. His political change came from the realization that his side was doing the oppressing. Protected by the guise of being _or the people, the Panthers took Betty_ life. The progressives left millions to die of AIDS, so they could preserve their leadership positions. His former friends on the left brutally excommunicated him from all their social relationships to reign power over him. It became clear that to fight for freedom, he had to be on the right and so the Freedom Center was born.

From the Freedom Center, he published thousands of high impact articles and books. He understood the systematic implications of seemingly benign cultural changes and used that knowledge to predict much of the future. Notably, he precisely forecast the intense campus antisemitism of 2024 in his book The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America published in 2006.

In 2007, David was crushed by the passing of his beloved daughter Sarah Rose who, more than any of his other children, inherited his indomitable spirit and passion for politics. She had finally succumbed to long-time chronic degeneration from her genetic condition Turner_ Syndrome. He captured the experience in his most intimate and perhaps his best book A Cracking of the Heart in 2009.

By the twenty teens, David had long been frustrated by what he referred to as the _oft, gentlemanly tactics of the Republican Party. He lamented that the Republicans were bringing a nerf gun to a nuclear war. He intimately knew the left_ tactics and desperately wanted his party to match them. His wish was granted when a new kind of candidate, Donald J. Trump, won the Republican nomination. David responded instantly with the best articulation of the Trump strategy in Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America. Later, in 2024, his son Benjamin would meet President Trump and mention David. President Trump_ face immediately lit up and he insisted that Benjamin get David on the phone immediately. Hospitalized and weak, David was still delighted to speak with the President and know that his message was heard and heeded.

In 2024, David published America Betrayed: How a Christian Monk Created America & Why the Left Is Determined to Destroy Her. In it, he carefully explained how the Catholic Church  through the indulgences  had removed the freedom inherent in being accountable to God and replaced them with the oppression of being accountable to the church. He then explained how that same idea had come back into vogue in the U.S. Right up until the final moments, David fought for freedom.

In the end, David helped countless people and expended every fiber of his being pushing society towards freedom. He may not have saved the world, but he most certainly made it a better place  especially for us. He was our super hero and we will love him forever.",2025-04-30 01:02:00+00:00,705.0,779.0,8356.0,12029.0

We_e thrilled to announce our strategic investment in Squads.

Programmable money is one of the most promising products enabled by crypto. Blockchains turn money into a dynamic, internet-native tool that can move globally, instantly, and under precise, programmable rules. Programmable money opens an endless set of possibilities for payments and money management. Automated payroll, conditional escrow, and bespoke treasury management strategies are just a few of the many tangible examples that exist today. Beyond today_ use cases, the potential for programmable money is vast  it_ the foundation for a new, global financial layer that is fast, automated, and globally accessible to anyone on the internet.

It_ never been a better time to build programmable money applications. Stablecoin adoption continues to grow rapidly, with enterprise and remittance use cases leading the charge. As of April 2025, stablecoins processed $37 trillion of annual transaction volume. Simultaneously, crypto custody infrastructure is becoming increasingly secure and easy to use, managing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of value.

Squads has been pushing the frontier of programmable money since inception. I first met @SimkinStepan, CEO and co-founder of Squads, in 2022 as Squads was just getting started. Fast forward three years to today, and they boast almost every major Solana project as a customer, help secure over $10 billion of assets, and have processed over $3 billion in stablecoin transfers. Almost every one of their customers I_e spoken with considers Squads a _ust have.

Squads offers three distinct products all powered by Squads Protocol:

Squads Multisig, a multi-sig wallet that enables teams to manage onchain funds and execute program upgrades.
Fuse, a consumer wallet that provides access to a USD financial account, complete with yield, payments, and card functionality out of the box. Importantly, anyone around the world can access this product, not just U.S. residents.
Altitude, a financial account for business that offers any business around the world a USD financial account with out of the box yield, payments, and soon, corporate cards.

What_ most impressive about Squads is how they balance pushing the frontier with extremely high security standards. Squads Protocol takes security so seriously that they were the first program on Solana to be formally verified. Squads robust security posture is the reason why almost every Solana project and more than $10 billion of assets remain on Squads Protocol today. Simultaneously, Squads constantly pushes the frontier of programmable money. This mentality is what drove the team to build Fuse and Altitude, each for a different audience.

This team is relentless in their mission to enable programmable money, and we_e excited to support them in their next chapter.",2025-05-14 14:15:00+00:00,8.0,9.0,85.0,127.0

Stablecoins are to finance what broadband was to the web: the substrate for something much larger. They represent one of the most tangible use cases for crypto_ digital dollar that moves at the speed of the internet, backed by real-world assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds. What began as tools for crypto trading are now rapidly evolving into a foundational layer for global payments.

Stablecoins enable seamless global payment systems that truly meet the needs of a global economy. From major fintechs and traditional financial institutions to multinational enterprises, stablecoins are being used for remittances, merchant payouts, treasury management, and B2B flows, unlocking speed, interoperability, and transparency in ways legacy systems cannot.

They are quickly becoming core financial infrastructure. Citibank recently released a report projecting that stablecoin circulation could grow from approximately $230 billion today to $1.6 trillion (base case) or $3.7 trillion (bull case) by 2030. Citi also estimates that stablecoin issuers could drive more than $1 trillion in net new purchases of U.S. Treasuries by 2030_otentially surpassing any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt.

The financial implications of this shift are massive. New research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that stablecoin flows compress short-term Treasury bill yields, producing effects similar to small-scale quantitative easing, ultimately helping reduce the national debt at a time when it is otherwise soaring. There are also national security implications, given that the current largest holders of U.S. debt are foreign countries with complex geopolitical relationships.

Stablecoins are digital dollars, core payments infrastructure, and increasingly, monetary instruments with global policy relevance. As SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda emphasized this week, tokenized assets offer _reater efficiencies in settlement, recordkeeping, and compliance. Regulatory frameworks should evolve to embrace these capabilities, not resist them.

Legislation like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act provides the regulatory scaffolding for stablecoin issuance in the U.S., including provisions for audits, 1:1 reserves, and state/federal oversight. This doesn_ just unlock safer onchain activity for existing crypto users; it creates an entirely new avenue for institutional use cases and helps preserve America_ economic leadership in the global financial system.

Tokenization won_ stop at money. The next wave will bring real-world assets (RWAs)_rom equities and bonds to funds and private credit_nchain. Stablecoins have demonstrated the playbook: start with simple, high-velocity use cases, build trust through scale, then extend the architecture to more complex assets.

We are rebuilding the financial system for a digital age from the ground up. This Administration, along with several federal courts, has acknowledged that reality. It_ time for leaders on both sides of the aisle in Congress to do the same.",2025-05-15 02:18:00+00:00,16.0,29.0,187.0,293.0

2025-05-15,all,"The U.S. Should Lead on Stablecoins

Stablecoins are to finance what broadband was to the web: the substrate for something much larger. They represent one of the most tangible use cases for crypto_ digital dollar that moves at the speed of the internet, backed by real-world assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds. What began as tools for crypto trading are now rapidly evolving into a foundational layer for global payments.

Stablecoins enable seamless global payment systems that truly meet the needs of a global economy. From major fintechs and traditional financial institutions to multinational enterprises, stablecoins are being used for remittances, merchant payouts, treasury management, and B2B flows, unlocking speed, interoperability, and transparency in ways legacy systems cannot.

They are quickly becoming core financial infrastructure. Citibank recently released a report projecting that stablecoin circulation could grow from approximately $230 billion today to $1.6 trillion (base case) or $3.7 trillion (bull case) by 2030. Citi also estimates that stablecoin issuers could drive more than $1 trillion in net new purchases of U.S. Treasuries by 2030_otentially surpassing any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt.

The financial implications of this shift are massive. New research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that stablecoin flows compress short-term Treasury bill yields, producing effects similar to small-scale quantitative easing, ultimately helping reduce the national debt at a time when it is otherwise soaring. There are also national security implications, given that the current largest holders of U.S. debt are foreign countries with complex geopolitical relationships.

Stablecoins are digital dollars, core payments infrastructure, and increasingly, monetary instruments with global policy relevance. As SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda emphasized this week, tokenized assets offer _reater efficiencies in settlement, recordkeeping, and compliance. Regulatory frameworks should evolve to embrace these capabilities, not resist them.

Legislation like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act provides the regulatory scaffolding for stablecoin issuance in the U.S., including provisions for audits, 1:1 reserves, and state/federal oversight. This doesn_ just unlock safer onchain activity for existing crypto users; it creates an entirely new avenue for institutional use cases and helps preserve America_ economic leadership in the global financial system.

Tokenization won_ stop at money. The next wave will bring real-world assets (RWAs)_rom equities and bonds to funds and private credit_nchain. Stablecoins have demonstrated the playbook: start with simple, high-velocity use cases, build trust through scale, then extend the architecture to more complex assets.

We are rebuilding the financial system for a digital age from the ground up. This Administration, along with several federal courts, has acknowledged that reality. It_ time for leaders on both sides of the aisle in Congress to do the same.",2025-05-15 02:18:00+00:00,16.0,29.0,187.0,293.0

Because once you attach money, the relationship shifts.

The problem:

Following a creator is win-win.
Fans get insight, inspiration, entertainment.
Creators get attention and audience growth.
No pressure. No expectations. Just pure fandom.

Now add money.

Suddenly it_ not _ love your work.
It_ _ invested in you. Where_ my return?

Admiration becomes accountability.

This is the beginning of a new era in computing. AI agents are becoming more than just tools that analyze data or generate content  they_e turning into autonomous software actors. These agents can log into services, move money, hire experts, and negotiate contracts. But there_ a problem: our current financial infrastructure wasn_ built for them.

Traditional payment rails assume a human is on one end of every transaction. That means delays like 3-day ACH transfers, and high fees  up to 3%  on credit card payments. Systems also flag automated activity as fraud, forcing manual reviews. This slows down innovation and limits what AI agents can actually do.

Catena Labs hopes to fix this. We_e leading their seed round because they_e building what the system needs. Led by Circle cofounder @psneville, who helped to take the stablecoin USDC from concept to one of the world_ most widely used digital dollars, Catena is creating a new financial stack from scratch  one designed specifically for AI. Their protocol will let trusted software agents send stablecoins across the globe with near-instant finality and ultra-low fees. It combines crypto_ speed and global reach with built-in identity and compliance that enterprises demand.

Sean has deep experience scaling regulated, production-grade financial systems. He_ joined by a world-class team from Meta, Google, Jump Crypto, and Protocol Labs  builders who know how to ship at scale.

The core idea is simple but powerful: software agents should be able to pay and get paid, instantly and safely. Catena_ regulated, AI-native rails make that possible. We think this unlocks an entire class of applications that weren_ feasible before  things like real-time payments for AI-generated content, or agents autonomously sourcing data and services on-demand.

Machine-speed systems need machine-speed money. Catena is building the missing link, and we_e excited to back them.",2025-05-20 14:00:00+00:00,61.0,67.0,499.0,816.0

2025-05-20,all,"We_e leading the seed round in @catena_labs because they_e building what our system needs: a new financial stack for AI agents to transact at machine speed.

This is the beginning of a new era in computing. AI agents are becoming more than just tools that analyze data or generate content  they_e turning into autonomous software actors. These agents can log into services, move money, hire experts, and negotiate contracts. But there_ a problem: our current financial infrastructure wasn_ built for them.

Traditional payment rails assume a human is on one end of every transaction. That means delays like 3-day ACH transfers, and high fees  up to 3%  on credit card payments. Systems also flag automated activity as fraud, forcing manual reviews. This slows down innovation and limits what AI agents can actually do.

Catena Labs hopes to fix this. We_e leading their seed round because they_e building what the system needs. Led by Circle cofounder @psneville, who helped to take the stablecoin USDC from concept to one of the world_ most widely used digital dollars, Catena is creating a new financial stack from scratch  one designed specifically for AI. Their protocol will let trusted software agents send stablecoins across the globe with near-instant finality and ultra-low fees. It combines crypto_ speed and global reach with built-in identity and compliance that enterprises demand.

Sean has deep experience scaling regulated, production-grade financial systems. He_ joined by a world-class team from Meta, Google, Jump Crypto, and Protocol Labs  builders who know how to ship at scale.

The core idea is simple but powerful: software agents should be able to pay and get paid, instantly and safely. Catena_ regulated, AI-native rails make that possible. We think this unlocks an entire class of applications that weren_ feasible before  things like real-time payments for AI-generated content, or agents autonomously sourcing data and services on-demand.

Machine-speed systems need machine-speed money. Catena is building the missing link, and we_e excited to back them.",2025-05-20 14:00:00+00:00,61.0,67.0,499.0,816.0

2025-05-26,positive,"Elon Musk: Humanoid robots could 10X the global economy.

_ think we're headed to a radically different world. I think a good world, an interesting world. My prediction actually for humanoid robots is that ultimately there will be tens of billions. I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2 but even better. Who wouldn't want to have their own personal C-3PO-R2-D2? That would be pretty great.

I also think it unlocks an immense amount of economic potential because when you think about what is the output of an economy, it is productivity per capita times population or capita. Once you have humanoid robots, the actual economic output potential is tremendous. It's really unlimited.

Potentially, we could have an economy 10 times the size of the current global economy where no one wants for anything. You know, sometimes in AI they talk about universal basic income.

Access to capital is a huge barrier for retail crypto traders. This forces them to choose between trenches or irresponsibly high leverage. There_ a better way.

Crypto trading is evolving from a monolithic, collateral-heavy world to a modular, capital-efficient future. Just as DeFi unbundled exchanges into primitives_MMs, oracles, lending markets_e_e now seeing the capital stack itself rearchitected.

The old way? On traditional venues you front the capital and take all the risk. Leverage amplifies both gains and catastrophic losses. It's a system designed to bleed most traders dry.

@Breakoutprop has a different model. They_e pioneering this shift by rewriting the trading capital structure stack by allowing users to trade with capital_ot against it.

Instead of your capital at risk, it's theirs. Traders bring the skill, they bring the capital. Both share the trading profits. Pass the evaluation, and traders get access to house money and no liquidation anxiety. 

It_ a structure that flips the script: risk is externalized, alpha is rewarded. The structure prioritizes upside for performance. Better traders can fast track their portfolio growth without resorting to high leverage.

What Breakout is building isn_ just a funding model; it_ a new financial primitive that slots cleanly into the emerging modular trading stack. Think: execution layer, perp infra, and now  capital-as-a-service.

Breakout accounts scale up to $100K in size (with max combined capital of $200K), and traders can access 5x leverage on BTC/ETH and 2x on altcoins. In practice, that means <$1K in evaluation fees can unlock up to $500K in buying power_ithout debt or collateral. Both traders and Breakout win, when traders win, but traders keep 8090% of profits, benefiting from instant, unconditional withdrawals. The model rewards precision over risk, and talent over bankroll. 

In a world moving toward unbundled infrastructure and composable finance, Breakoutprop is a bet on crypto-native trading capital structures. We believe this is how trading should look: permissionless access to capital, aligned incentives, and modular design.

2025-05-30,neutral,"Charlie Lee, Litecoin, and What I Saw That Most People Miss

Attending the 2025 Litecoin Conference this year wasn_ just a curiosity or a calendar filler. I_ deeply invested in Litecoin, literally. My mining operation is rooted in Scrypt, with #Litecoin and its merge-mining counterparts at the center. And while I believe in the long-term utility of the project, it has underperformed compared to other areas of my portfolio. That_ not a reason to walk away; it_ a reason to dig deeper.

Like any serious investor or business operator, I understand that performance alone doesn_ always tell the whole story. This year_ conference offered a rare opportunity to be on the ground, face-to-face with the builders, partners, and community members who are shaping Litecoin_ and $LTC's path forward. I came with an open but critical mindset. I wasn_ looking to be impressed. I was looking to be convinced.

And what I found was more than reassuring. It was reinvigorating.

There were plenty of insightful presentations, partnerships, and ideas worth talking about, many of which I_l cover in the days ahead. But one moment, and one person in particular, set the tone for everything else I experienced: Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ creator.

The Critic in Me Was Ready
Let me be clear: I don_ blindly follow any project. Over the years, I_e walked away from more than a few. I_e been in business long enough to know when something doesn_ pass the eye test. And in crypto especially, the founder can tell you a lot, whether they mean to or not.

The opening keynote was delivered by Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ founder. I had seen him before in interviews and podcasts, but this was my first time seeing him live. It gave me a new lens, one that revealed more than any soundbite ever could.

Sincerity Over Showmanship
What Charlie delivered wasn_ a performance; it was genuine. And that distinction matters. In a space where strong public speakers are surprisingly rare, his sincerity stood out. Most crypto founders don_ even take the stage themselves. When they do, it_ often a letdown. I_e sat through more than a few keynotes where I left wondering how that person ever managed to lead anything.

So while I wasn_ entirely surprised by Charlie_ underwhelming stage presence, it still left a mark. He wasn_ theatrical. He wasn_ trying to sell a dream. Instead, he delivered a kind of calm, understated clarity. It didn_ come off as scripted. It came off as real.

As someone who_ started businesses, faced setbacks, and had to pitch and present in tough rooms, I_e learned to look past polish and see what_ underneath. And what I saw in Charlie was someone who still deeply cares. He has no obligation to be here. He_ already succeeded. Yet here he is, contributing, showing up, and helping guide the next phase of the project he started.

Reading Between the Lines
Later in the event, I had a short conversation with Charlie on the sidelines. It only confirmed what I had already picked up from his keynote. He didn_ try to impress me. He didn_ pitch. He just spoke honestly.

People still criticize him for selling his Litecoin holdings back in 2017. But they miss the context. He didn_ award himself a massive pre-mine. He mined or purchased his coins like anyone else. He sold some when the market peaked, just as many responsible business owners and investors do.

What matters more is what he did afterward: he stayed.

He didn_ disappear. He didn_ wash his hands of the project. From what I can tell, he_ still helping to fund events like this one. He_ still building relationships. He_ still working to move the protocol forward. And that, in my view, is far more telling than any coin balance ever was.

The Bigger Picture
Litecoin is often misunderstood. Critics love to call it a #Bitcoin clone, a second-tier asset, or simply irrelevant compared to $BTC. But that perspective overlooks its purpose. Charlie didn_ create Litecoin to compete with Bitcoin. He created it to complement it.

It provides faster transaction times, lower fees, and a reliable testbed for innovation. It has weathered market cycles and FUD campaigns. And it_ still here, still functioning, and still finding ways to be useful in a maturing crypto ecosystem.

This conference reminded me of that. And it did more than justify my continued investment. It recharged it.

So What_ Next?
Over the next week or so, you can expect a series of write-ups from me covering my takeaways from many of the presenters and panels at this year_ Litecoin Conference. I_l be diving into the technologies, ideas, and insights I believe are poised to make real impacts in the market. I_l also explain why Litecoin deserves a fresh look from those who may have dismissed it in the past due to price action alone.

Litecoin has grown far beyond its early label as a Bitcoin fork or copycat. It is maturing into a monetary technology with its own identity. In my view, it is positioned to become a major force in the next phase of the crypto cycle.

2025-05-30,neutral,"Charlie Lee, Litecoin, and What I Saw That Most People Miss

Attending the 2025 Litecoin Conference this year wasn_ just a curiosity or a calendar filler. I_ deeply invested in Litecoin, literally. My mining operation is rooted in Scrypt, with #Litecoin and its merge-mining counterparts at the center. And while I believe in the long-term utility of the project, it has underperformed compared to other areas of my portfolio. That_ not a reason to walk away; it_ a reason to dig deeper.

Like any serious investor or business operator, I understand that performance alone doesn_ always tell the whole story. This year_ conference offered a rare opportunity to be on the ground, face-to-face with the builders, partners, and community members who are shaping Litecoin_ and $LTC's path forward. I came with an open but critical mindset. I wasn_ looking to be impressed. I was looking to be convinced.

And what I found was more than reassuring. It was reinvigorating.

There were plenty of insightful presentations, partnerships, and ideas worth talking about, many of which I_l cover in the days ahead. But one moment, and one person in particular, set the tone for everything else I experienced: Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ creator.

The Critic in Me Was Ready
Let me be clear: I don_ blindly follow any project. Over the years, I_e walked away from more than a few. I_e been in business long enough to know when something doesn_ pass the eye test. And in crypto especially, the founder can tell you a lot, whether they mean to or not.

The opening keynote was delivered by Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ founder. I had seen him before in interviews and podcasts, but this was my first time seeing him live. It gave me a new lens, one that revealed more than any soundbite ever could.

Sincerity Over Showmanship
What Charlie delivered wasn_ a performance; it was genuine. And that distinction matters. In a space where strong public speakers are surprisingly rare, his sincerity stood out. Most crypto founders don_ even take the stage themselves. When they do, it_ often a letdown. I_e sat through more than a few keynotes where I left wondering how that person ever managed to lead anything.

So while I wasn_ entirely surprised by Charlie_ underwhelming stage presence, it still left a mark. He wasn_ theatrical. He wasn_ trying to sell a dream. Instead, he delivered a kind of calm, understated clarity. It didn_ come off as scripted. It came off as real.

As someone who_ started businesses, faced setbacks, and had to pitch and present in tough rooms, I_e learned to look past polish and see what_ underneath. And what I saw in Charlie was someone who still deeply cares. He has no obligation to be here. He_ already succeeded. Yet here he is, contributing, showing up, and helping guide the next phase of the project he started.

Reading Between the Lines
Later in the event, I had a short conversation with Charlie on the sidelines. It only confirmed what I had already picked up from his keynote. He didn_ try to impress me. He didn_ pitch. He just spoke honestly.

People still criticize him for selling his Litecoin holdings back in 2017. But they miss the context. He didn_ award himself a massive pre-mine. He mined or purchased his coins like anyone else. He sold some when the market peaked, just as many responsible business owners and investors do.

What matters more is what he did afterward: he stayed.

He didn_ disappear. He didn_ wash his hands of the project. From what I can tell, he_ still helping to fund events like this one. He_ still building relationships. He_ still working to move the protocol forward. And that, in my view, is far more telling than any coin balance ever was.

The Bigger Picture
Litecoin is often misunderstood. Critics love to call it a #Bitcoin clone, a second-tier asset, or simply irrelevant compared to $BTC. But that perspective overlooks its purpose. Charlie didn_ create Litecoin to compete with Bitcoin. He created it to complement it.

It provides faster transaction times, lower fees, and a reliable testbed for innovation. It has weathered market cycles and FUD campaigns. And it_ still here, still functioning, and still finding ways to be useful in a maturing crypto ecosystem.

This conference reminded me of that. And it did more than justify my continued investment. It recharged it.

So What_ Next?
Over the next week or so, you can expect a series of write-ups from me covering my takeaways from many of the presenters and panels at this year_ Litecoin Conference. I_l be diving into the technologies, ideas, and insights I believe are poised to make real impacts in the market. I_l also explain why Litecoin deserves a fresh look from those who may have dismissed it in the past due to price action alone.

Litecoin has grown far beyond its early label as a Bitcoin fork or copycat. It is maturing into a monetary technology with its own identity. In my view, it is positioned to become a major force in the next phase of the crypto cycle.

2025-06-01,positive,"""If a trader wants to trade massive size, one of the best things to do is tell the world beforehand.""

This is a ludicrous claim and is a consequence of believing your own BS.

Jeff argues that making every whale order fully transparent on-chain actually improves their execution quality because

(a) market-makers see the flow, step in, and tighten spreads, and
(b) the public liquidation/stop prices don_ really put whales at risk.

Both are objectively wrong.

(1) Pre-trade transparency increases adverse-selection costs for large traders

Execution cost is a zero-sum game because market-makers are utility maximizing entities. And information is a cost that is factored into this spread. Every extra dollar a market-maker extracts in spread is a dollar the transacting side pays. 

This is micro-structure 101. 

When a dealer/market maker knows the true size of an order, they widen spreads to offset inventory and information risk. If size revelation were free, TWAP/VWAP algos and hidden-size (_ceberg) orders wouldn_ exist.

By transmitting full-size, the whale ends up paying both the prevailing-spread and the follow-on impact as the book-reprices. 

Hyperliquid publishes size, margin, even liquidation prices in real time. That removes every information advantage the whale has and is offering this up for free to the market makers. So either you:

(a) keep that advantage and trade at the prevailing spread OR 
(b) you give it up and pay both the prevailing spread plus the follow-on price impact as the book re-prices. 

Perfect transparency doesn_ eliminate spread_t simply transfers the cost of execution entirely onto the party showing size.

In fact you also see this behavior on the HL orderbook. Every time there is a large order at the TOB, you notice the other-side immediately thin out. You can observe this even without an algo. Just stare at the orderbook long enough.

(2) Transparency feeds other  predatory and anticipatory traders further increasing the cost of transacting.

There is already a ton of empirical data and research on on _redatory trading, _rder-anticipation, and MEV all document that when large flow is observable, other fast agents front-run or back-run it, extracting rents from the order-placing originator.

See Flash Boys 2.0 or this paper  arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234

(3) Public liquidation bands create new attack surfaces and invite _unting

Liquidation _unts are not hypothetical. Same logic as broadcasting size: information is a cost. If the world knows your liquidation price, you WILL get hunted. Ask @JamesWynnReal.  Jeff knows this; spinning a known risk as a _eature is pure narrative gymnastics.

(4) Tradfi market structure tells the opposite story

50% of U.S. equity volume now trades off-exchange or in dark pools precisely so institutions don't advertise size.

Icebergs, conditional blocks, and RFQ platforms like @tradeparadigm and @Tradeweb exist simply because big size and fully lit books don_ mix. Paradigm alone is 35% of Deribit_ daily volume_roof that large clips avoid the CLOB. We wouldn_ have a business if everything went to the lit book. 

Retardio

Also note that in Tradfi regulators demand post-trade transparency for fairness, yet allow pre-trade opacity because it delivers better execution.

TLDR,
a) Transparent books are great for retail price discovery; they_e empirically worse for block execution. This is why @tradeparadex will have both a CLOB and RFQs for large-block execution away from the orderbook.

b) 50-years of market-structure evolution, real-world behavior of institutional desks (dark pools, algos, hidden size) and the academic record on predatory trading, front-running and MEV all contradict Jeff_ arguments.

The more troubling thing is that yet another crypto founder is more than happy to bend facts to fit a self serving narrative. 

@chameleon_jeff: ""My exchange is transparent so therefore transparent exchanges are better""

@armaniferrante ""I built a centralized exchange because it is easy so all exchanges are better and more secure""  (lol_)

2025-06-01,all,"""If a trader wants to trade massive size, one of the best things to do is tell the world beforehand.""

This is a ludicrous claim and is a consequence of believing your own BS.

Jeff argues that making every whale order fully transparent on-chain actually improves their execution quality because

(a) market-makers see the flow, step in, and tighten spreads, and
(b) the public liquidation/stop prices don_ really put whales at risk.

Both are objectively wrong.

(1) Pre-trade transparency increases adverse-selection costs for large traders

Execution cost is a zero-sum game because market-makers are utility maximizing entities. And information is a cost that is factored into this spread. Every extra dollar a market-maker extracts in spread is a dollar the transacting side pays. 

This is micro-structure 101. 

When a dealer/market maker knows the true size of an order, they widen spreads to offset inventory and information risk. If size revelation were free, TWAP/VWAP algos and hidden-size (_ceberg) orders wouldn_ exist.

By transmitting full-size, the whale ends up paying both the prevailing-spread and the follow-on impact as the book-reprices. 

Hyperliquid publishes size, margin, even liquidation prices in real time. That removes every information advantage the whale has and is offering this up for free to the market makers. So either you:

(a) keep that advantage and trade at the prevailing spread OR 
(b) you give it up and pay both the prevailing spread plus the follow-on price impact as the book re-prices. 

Perfect transparency doesn_ eliminate spread_t simply transfers the cost of execution entirely onto the party showing size.

In fact you also see this behavior on the HL orderbook. Every time there is a large order at the TOB, you notice the other-side immediately thin out. You can observe this even without an algo. Just stare at the orderbook long enough.

(2) Transparency feeds other  predatory and anticipatory traders further increasing the cost of transacting.

There is already a ton of empirical data and research on on _redatory trading, _rder-anticipation, and MEV all document that when large flow is observable, other fast agents front-run or back-run it, extracting rents from the order-placing originator.

See Flash Boys 2.0 or this paper  arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234

(3) Public liquidation bands create new attack surfaces and invite _unting

Liquidation _unts are not hypothetical. Same logic as broadcasting size: information is a cost. If the world knows your liquidation price, you WILL get hunted. Ask @JamesWynnReal.  Jeff knows this; spinning a known risk as a _eature is pure narrative gymnastics.

(4) Tradfi market structure tells the opposite story

50% of U.S. equity volume now trades off-exchange or in dark pools precisely so institutions don't advertise size.

Icebergs, conditional blocks, and RFQ platforms like @tradeparadigm and @Tradeweb exist simply because big size and fully lit books don_ mix. Paradigm alone is 35% of Deribit_ daily volume_roof that large clips avoid the CLOB. We wouldn_ have a business if everything went to the lit book. 

Retardio

Also note that in Tradfi regulators demand post-trade transparency for fairness, yet allow pre-trade opacity because it delivers better execution.

TLDR,
a) Transparent books are great for retail price discovery; they_e empirically worse for block execution. This is why @tradeparadex will have both a CLOB and RFQs for large-block execution away from the orderbook.

b) 50-years of market-structure evolution, real-world behavior of institutional desks (dark pools, algos, hidden size) and the academic record on predatory trading, front-running and MEV all contradict Jeff_ arguments.

The more troubling thing is that yet another crypto founder is more than happy to bend facts to fit a self serving narrative. 

@chameleon_jeff: ""My exchange is transparent so therefore transparent exchanges are better""

@armaniferrante ""I built a centralized exchange because it is easy so all exchanges are better and more secure""  (lol_)

2025-06-02,positive,"There are many details worth discussing in the House market structure bill, but the big question is:

How much discretion are we comfortable giving to regulators?

DAMCA (aka the CLARITY Act) is a meaty bill at 236 pages, but it leaves many issues unresolved, instead authorizing  and frequently requiring  the SEC and CFTC to figure them out in rulemaking. This is typical for legislation: Congress sets out a regulatory framework and then empowers the agencies to fill up the details.

Historically, that approach has been a non-starter for crypto. When Gensler's SEC was in ""kill the industry"" mode, our best defense was that the SEC lacked jurisdiction to regulate this novel market. Legislation clearly giving the SEC more authority was unthinkable in that environment, since it was obvious that the SEC would use any new power it received to destroy crypto.

As a result, past negotiations over market structure bills focused largely on cabining agency discretion. If there was a way that a hostile regulator could abuse a new grant of authority to destroy crypto, then the bill was unacceptable. This approach was well-justified, but it also made legislation practically impossible: there's just no way to hammer out every detail of a new regulatory framework this significant in Congress.

Now the environment has changed. We have regulators at the SEC and CFTC who deeply understand crypto and want to implement reasonable rules that work for the technology and the industry. But we only have them for sure until January 20, 2029  after that, we could be looking at four more years of Gensler or someone like him. Fear of that risk is a primary driver of the politics underlying the market structure bill today.

The industry has to decide between two options:

(1) demand a bill that gives agencies so little discretion that crypto could survive a second Gensler term, or

(2) accept agency authority with the hope that current leadership does a ton of great rulemaking and future leadership doesn't reverse course.

The risk of (1) is that we don't get a market structure bill done at all. Reasonable minds can differ on what that would mean for crypto. Some will say it's fine, that we built everything we have now under the status quo, that agency rulemaking will continue to unlock innovation, and that we shouldn't rush something as existentially important as market structure  we only get one shot at this. Others will say this is our best and maybe only chance, that the status quo was a path to ruin, that perfect can't be the enemy of good, and that acting now will legitimize and energize the industry in a way that makes future attacks politically unviable.

The risk of (2) is obvious: an anti-crypto president wins the next election and new anti-crypto agency leaders have all the firepower they need to kill us, because we stupidly handed it to them. The devil is in the details here  what authorities do they have, and how exactly can they abuse them  but it's hard to deny that this scenario is a plausible one.

The choice between these two options will determine DAMCA's future as much as any detail in the bill.

The bill's authors are collecting feedback now in advance of a hearing this week and a bill markup next week. Hopefully there will be changes to give the industry more comfort that crypto will be protected from future hostile regulators, along with other important fixes throughout the draft.

The early reaction to the bill has been positive, but don't take that to mean everyone is on board, and don't be surprised if the early applause turns to concern as the prospect of DAMCA actually becoming law sets in. Stay tuned  this is not a drill.",2025-06-02 13:23:00+00:00,27.0,16.0,92.0,205.0

2025-06-03,positive,"Moving $1B for just $1 on Bitcoin looks amazing but it should also worry you for Bitcoin's future - at least a little bit.

The problem is, that tiny fee doesn't pay for transaction finality of the transfer. Neither does that entire block, which only had ~$3k in fees. Even the last hour of blocks total just ~$15k in fees.

Why does this matter? Finality comes from the economic cost to reverse mined blocks. Right now, 99%+ of Bitcoin_ economic security comes from new issuance, not fees. But issuance trends toward zero over time.

Without subsidies, you'd need around 600 blocks (~4 days) for today's finality. 

Caveats:
- Maybe we currently ""overpay"" for security, leaving some room as issuance decreases.
- Finality isn't purely economic_ocial consensus helps too. But relying too much on social consensus leads back toward tradfi-like trust.
- For a $1B transaction, waiting days is manageable. For smaller transactions, it's not practical.
- Longer finality times can decrease demand, further extending finality times_ dangerous spiral.

Bitcoin's economic problem isn't getting much attention right now, and with Bitcoin L2s we are arguably in a better position than ever to solve it. 

But it's still looming, and the Bitcoin community's inability to ship even simple updates like op_cat or op_ctv don't bode well for solving this 1000x bigger issue.

2025-06-03,positive,"Respectfully disagree with Matteo  I think there are sound points, but some important nuance is missing.

---

1. Latency is always a race to zero

Traditional HFT operates in the nano- and microsecond realm. No current blockchain  not even @megaeth_labs (10ms) or admittedly @bulletxyz_ (3ms)  comes close. The idea that an execution layer can fully eliminate _tate delta through FIFO processing assumes an ideal that doesn_ exist in real markets.

> _f the execution layer is performant enough to process everything FIFO then prioritizing cancels no longer makes sense.
This isn_ quite right.

The race isn_ between order placement and execution, but between the MM_ cancel and the taker_ fill  and even a few ms head start makes all the difference. In TradFi, HFTs purposely obscure their true latency to retain a _eserve edge when caught. Latency asymmetry is the game.

---

2. Fairness vs Liquidity Bootstrapping

DeFi isn_ TradFi. The biggest challenge today isn't fairness  it_ liquidity. TradFi exchanges are mature, with deep books and robust price discovery. DeFi isn_ there yet.

That said, it's false to argue _asdaq doesn_ have speed bumps, so toxic HFT must not be an issue. In fact, smaller TradFi venues like IEX and CHX introduced speed bumps precisely to combat these dynamics.

The HFT arms race is real in traditional financial markets:
* HFT flow accounts for ~20% of volume 
* Raises liquidity costs by 17%
* Makers win the cancel race just 13% of the time [1]

---

My take? We can and should have both.

DEXs must attract deep liquidity to compete with CEXs. That requires protecting MMs from toxic flow while enabling efficient execution. We_e already seen success here  Hyperliquid users accept its reordering logic, because it enables tighter spreads and better fills via MM _ast look advantages.

That_ why @bulletxyz_ is designed to do both:

* Low-latency (ms-level) execution
* App-specific sequencing

This is hard to do on general-purpose L1s  but necessary if we want DeFi to scale competitively.

2025-06-03,neutral,"Hardness & @Ethereum 101

Ethereum_ distinctive property is hardness.

We usually talk about Ethereum_ core properties as things like _ecentralized trust, censorship resistance, digital property rights, or credible neutrality.

All of these depend on a common property: that Ethereum will behave reliably. That it can make credible commitments about the future:

- That your funds will remain accessible to you even if you don_ touch them for years

- That your smart contract will execute as written

- That a transaction you send today or a year from now cannot be censored

- That your private transaction will remain private

- That Ethereum itself will not be captured, and will remain credibly neutral

Hardness is the root property that enables all of them. It is the irreducible _it of trust, the basic capability of a system to make credible claims about future behaviour.

Hardness is what makes blockchains valuable

Because Ethereum is sufficiently hard, it can be used as a platform for systems that require reliability and trustworthiness. Things like:

- Money and assets
- Contracts and complex financial structures
- Identity systems
- Governance
- Payment and savings systems
- Enduring art & culture

Web2 was built on flimsy foundations, because it relied on companies that rose and fell, shut down platforms, or changed the rules underneath us.

Ethereum has helped to strengthen the web, like steel rebar woven into cement. Web3 is an internet that can be a reliable foundation for anyone to build on top of. 

Hardness helps us understand Ethereum's place in the world

Hardness isn't new. But the invention of blockchains like Ethereum helps us see it more clearly. 

We also rely on institutions and atoms as sources of hardness, and have for millennia. 

Institutions like governments & legal systems can be reliable and predictable, enabling property rights, democratic institutions, and contract law. 

Atoms and other basic properties of our world also work as a source of hardness. Gold serves as money because its supply is limited on earth, and not because of the rules of some institution.

The idea of hardness helps us compare these systems against each other. It helps people outside of crypto see that blockchains are just a new way of doing an old thing, something so familiar to us that we didn't really have a word for it.

It makes it easier to explain the value blockchains like Ethereum offer the world: they are a new source of hardness, with new valuable properties that offer us new choices.

- Ethereum is a decentralized source of hardness. It is not under the control of any centralized institution like a company, VC, or government. 

- Ethereum is global. Anyone with an internet connection can use it. Ethereum and the network of L2s built on top of it will form a seamless, interoperable platform for hardness. 

- Ethereum is transparent and auditable. We can verify, instead of naively trusting. Anyone can validate the chain using simple tools. Every year, those tools will become easier and faster until almost any device can reach out and touch Ethereum_ hardened surface for itself.

- Ethereum_ hardness does not depend on the political winds. Ethereum_ contracts and property rights don_ stop working if your government does. Ethereum_ data won_ be taken away from you by a change to a corporation_ ToS. When that matters, it matters a lot.

Ethereum will not replace all other sources of hardness. 

But it will compete with and complement them. For the first time in a long time, we have new materials we can use to build our economies and societies.

Just as an architect must carefully plan not only the design of a building, but also the materials used to construct that design, so must we carefully consider the materials we use to build our civilization_ infrastructure.

2025-06-03,all,"Moving $1B for just $1 on Bitcoin looks amazing but it should also worry you for Bitcoin's future - at least a little bit.

The problem is, that tiny fee doesn't pay for transaction finality of the transfer. Neither does that entire block, which only had ~$3k in fees. Even the last hour of blocks total just ~$15k in fees.

Why does this matter? Finality comes from the economic cost to reverse mined blocks. Right now, 99%+ of Bitcoin_ economic security comes from new issuance, not fees. But issuance trends toward zero over time.

Without subsidies, you'd need around 600 blocks (~4 days) for today's finality. 

Caveats:
- Maybe we currently ""overpay"" for security, leaving some room as issuance decreases.
- Finality isn't purely economic_ocial consensus helps too. But relying too much on social consensus leads back toward tradfi-like trust.
- For a $1B transaction, waiting days is manageable. For smaller transactions, it's not practical.
- Longer finality times can decrease demand, further extending finality times_ dangerous spiral.

Bitcoin's economic problem isn't getting much attention right now, and with Bitcoin L2s we are arguably in a better position than ever to solve it. 

But it's still looming, and the Bitcoin community's inability to ship even simple updates like op_cat or op_ctv don't bode well for solving this 1000x bigger issue. 

What I want to see over the next few years is a more functional community that proves it can either agree on things and move forward, or disagree and commit and move forward.",2025-06-03 07:54:00+00:00,81.0,63.0,670.0,1039.0
2025-06-03,all,"Hardness & @Ethereum 101

Ethereum_ distinctive property is hardness.

We usually talk about Ethereum_ core properties as things like _ecentralized trust, censorship resistance, digital property rights, or credible neutrality.

All of these depend on a common property: that Ethereum will behave reliably. That it can make credible commitments about the future:

- That your funds will remain accessible to you even if you don_ touch them for years

- That your smart contract will execute as written

- That a transaction you send today or a year from now cannot be censored

- That your private transaction will remain private

- That Ethereum itself will not be captured, and will remain credibly neutral

Hardness is the root property that enables all of them. It is the irreducible _it of trust, the basic capability of a system to make credible claims about future behaviour.

Hardness is what makes blockchains valuable

Because Ethereum is sufficiently hard, it can be used as a platform for systems that require reliability and trustworthiness. Things like:

- Money and assets
- Contracts and complex financial structures
- Identity systems
- Governance
- Payment and savings systems
- Enduring art & culture

Web2 was built on flimsy foundations, because it relied on companies that rose and fell, shut down platforms, or changed the rules underneath us.

Ethereum has helped to strengthen the web, like steel rebar woven into cement. Web3 is an internet that can be a reliable foundation for anyone to build on top of. 

Hardness helps us understand Ethereum's place in the world

Hardness isn't new. But the invention of blockchains like Ethereum helps us see it more clearly. 

We also rely on institutions and atoms as sources of hardness, and have for millennia. 

Institutions like governments & legal systems can be reliable and predictable, enabling property rights, democratic institutions, and contract law. 

Atoms and other basic properties of our world also work as a source of hardness. Gold serves as money because its supply is limited on earth, and not because of the rules of some institution.

The idea of hardness helps us compare these systems against each other. It helps people outside of crypto see that blockchains are just a new way of doing an old thing, something so familiar to us that we didn't really have a word for it.

It makes it easier to explain the value blockchains like Ethereum offer the world: they are a new source of hardness, with new valuable properties that offer us new choices.

- Ethereum is a decentralized source of hardness. It is not under the control of any centralized institution like a company, VC, or government. 

- Ethereum is global. Anyone with an internet connection can use it. Ethereum and the network of L2s built on top of it will form a seamless, interoperable platform for hardness. 

- Ethereum is transparent and auditable. We can verify, instead of naively trusting. Anyone can validate the chain using simple tools. Every year, those tools will become easier and faster until almost any device can reach out and touch Ethereum_ hardened surface for itself.

- Ethereum_ hardness does not depend on the political winds. Ethereum_ contracts and property rights don_ stop working if your government does. Ethereum_ data won_ be taken away from you by a change to a corporation_ ToS. When that matters, it matters a lot.

Ethereum will not replace all other sources of hardness. 

But it will compete with and complement them. For the first time in a long time, we have new materials we can use to build our economies and societies.

Just as an architect must carefully plan not only the design of a building, but also the materials used to construct that design, so must we carefully consider the materials we use to build our civilization_ infrastructure.

What do we want our civilization to be made of?",2025-06-03 16:36:00+00:00,37.0,82.0,407.0,682.0

That_ how the NYSE works.

That_ how trading scaled.

Why are CLOBs being rediscovered in crypto like they_e a new primitive?  

Because for the first time 
We can build CLOBs that are 
open by default 
cryptographically verifiable 
resistant to censorship 
provably honest 
not because someone promised they are 
but because the math says so

Not trust me bro 
Not audited 
Not we_l freeze your account if you don't play by our rules

Instead 
Here_ the proof 
Every fill, every match, every cancellation 
provable on-chain or off-chain via zero-knowledge proofs  

This isn_ just a shift in backend architecture 
It_ a shift in trust 
From regulators to math 
From black boxes to glass boxes  

The excitement isn_ about reinventing the wheel 
It_ about finally making it run on open decentralized rails

2025-06-13,positive,"I_ excited to announce we_e led a $33 million seed round in @yupp_ai, a consumer product that allows anyone to discover and compare the latest AI models for free. AI needs robust and trustworthy human data. Crypto is built to provide it.

Modern AI systems are shaped not only by compute and algorithms but by human feedback. Companies use post-training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to improve their models. These techniques can reduce bias and enable higher quality, more coherent responses to prompts  crucial for accelerating progress in AI. Model evaluation is similarly critical, but a model can only be made better after first deciding what _etter means.

That_ where challenges arise: Companies don't like to share  they keep their data and training processes secret. As a result, model improvements are constrained by what can be learned from closed systems or static benchmarks that are rarely informed by real-world use. These constraints make AI models difficult to evaluate. Users are also left in the dark, with little insight into how their feedback shapes models or whether it_ used at all. Some leaderboards and crowdsourcing sites attempt to shed light here, but they generally don_ enable users to audit their contributions or see any direct benefit from participating. Platforms that claim to be fair and transparent often rely more on good faith than enforceable standards.

We believe crypto can bring transparency and ownership to this murky area of AI. Blockchains can make it easier for people to receive rewards for their contributions. They can also provide AI builders with assurances about the quality and provenance of the feedback data and evaluations they_e incorporating into their models. So users get incentives, builders get trustworthy data, and everyone can audit either side of the open market.

Yupp crowdsources model evaluation: users enter prompts, see multiple AI-generated responses side-by-side, and then pick the best ones. Their choices create digitally signed _ackets of preference data that are useful for AI post-training and evaluation. In addition to users getting access to the latest models for free, they receive rewards based on the feedback that they provide.

Yupp_ design turns human judgment into a renewable economic resource. Data _xpires as newer interactions replace it, creating a natural flywheel: more usage yields fresher evaluations; fresher evaluations yield better models; better models attract more usage. All participants  from users to AI model builders  can participate and see that the same transparent rules apply to everyone, ensuring a credibly neutral marketplace. No one can hide the scoreboard, and no one can manipulate the rewards or results.

The founders bring deep experience in both AI and crypto. They built consumer-scale machine learning products together in the early days of Twitter. @pankaj ran global consumer engineering for Google Pay and @Coinbase. @gilad was a machine learning lead at GoogleX. The early team already counts senior engineers from Google, Coinbase, and top research labs.

AI needs strong, reliable evaluation based on large-scale human input. Crypto is the trust machine that can help deliver it. By enabling people worldwide to contribute model-improving feedback, Yupp aims to become the default evaluation layer for the future of AI. We_e proud to back Yupp and look forward to helping them build the onchain feedback loop that ensures the rewards of AI innovation are shared by everyone who helps create it.",2025-06-13 20:50:00+00:00,63.0,64.0,560.0,877.0

 FT is in talks with major shipping cos to use Benji in supply chain finance

2025-06-18,positive,"in singapore last year i gave a talk called ""cryptodollarization"". the idea is dollarization via stablecoins. now with the GENIUS act about to pass and bessent's comments about stables reaching $3.7T (!!) (13% of M3), i believe stablecoins are being unleashed as an economic weapon to dollarize the rest of the world and help reset the US fiscal position. 

cryptodollarization has happened already, arguably in venezuela, argentina (partial), and nigeria (partial). i believe it's much more aggressive than conventional dollarization, which is often limited by availability of physical banknotes. 

I believe that in a decade there will be many fewer sovereign currencies and most weak nations will be  dollarized  not through USG intervention but by a spontaneous ""bottom up"" process (this happened in Ecuador in 99/20 as described by larry white). in effect consumers engage in currency substitution and force the government's hand. 

stablecoins eliminate the power of borders in currency choice and allow network effects to actually take hold. this is why we see the dollar representing >99% of stablecoins but only 40-60% of international reserves and financial flows. stablecoins make currency substitution must faster and more aggressive, and they are also ~impossible to stop. in almost all cases where nation states have attempted to prohibit flows out of local FX into USD stablecoins, they have eventually relented. 

in my talk I built a simple model to try and guess where these spontaneous crypto-dollarizations might occur (see the last couple slides).

2025-06-18,all,"in singapore last year i gave a talk called ""cryptodollarization"". the idea is dollarization via stablecoins. now with the GENIUS act about to pass and bessent's comments about stables reaching $3.7T (!!) (13% of M3), i believe stablecoins are being unleashed as an economic weapon to dollarize the rest of the world and help reset the US fiscal position. 

cryptodollarization has happened already, arguably in venezuela, argentina (partial), and nigeria (partial). i believe it's much more aggressive than conventional dollarization, which is often limited by availability of physical banknotes. 

I believe that in a decade there will be many fewer sovereign currencies and most weak nations will be  dollarized  not through USG intervention but by a spontaneous ""bottom up"" process (this happened in Ecuador in 99/20 as described by larry white). in effect consumers engage in currency substitution and force the government's hand. 

stablecoins eliminate the power of borders in currency choice and allow network effects to actually take hold. this is why we see the dollar representing >99% of stablecoins but only 40-60% of international reserves and financial flows. stablecoins make currency substitution must faster and more aggressive, and they are also ~impossible to stop. in almost all cases where nation states have attempted to prohibit flows out of local FX into USD stablecoins, they have eventually relented. 

in my talk I built a simple model to try and guess where these spontaneous crypto-dollarizations might occur (see the last couple slides). 

i wanted to revisit this talk because these predictions have become much closer to reality in the last 12 months. the government is saying the quiet part out loud: stablecoins are an economic weapon to passively dollarize the entire planet.

Imagine waking up in a decade to find your Bitcoin wallet drained. Not because of a hack, but because the math that once protected it has silently broken down. No alerts. No patch. Just physics, catching up.

The financial world  both traditional and decentralized  runs on cryptography. But that foundation is under threat from quantum computing.

In 2024, Google_ Willow chip solved in minutes a problem that would take the best classical supercomputer longer than the age of the universe to crack. Experts estimate that quantum computers will reach the threshold to break today_ cryptographic systems sometime between 2035 and 2050. Close enough to matter now.

The U.S. government is pushing federal agencies and the banks they work with to migrate to post-quantum standards by 2030. But for decentralized financial systems, coordination is much harder. There_ no single vendor or update cycle. The upgrade path is messy.

Most of crypto is sleepwalking toward this risk, even though the stakes are existential. But one team is sounding the alarm and building the safety net.

That_ why we led an investment in Project Eleven @qdayclock.

Project Eleven is building the infrastructure crypto needs to survive and thrive in a post-quantum world.

Their first product, yellowpages, is like a fire escape for your Bitcoin. It lets holders generate quantum-resistant keys, prove ownership of their existing addresses, and publicly register those proofs, without moving funds or waiting for a protocol upgrade. It_ simple, free, and available today. It_ a way to secure what you already own against a threat that hasn_ arrived, yet.

Project Eleven is led by @apruden08, someone I_e known and respected for years. We first met at Andreessen Horowitz, where we were both investment partners on the crypto team. Even then, it was clear that, as a former Special Forces officer, he had a rare combination of vision, rigor, and operational grit. He later joined Aleo (a Variant portfolio company) as COO, where he led the team at the frontier of decentralized systems and bleeding-edge cryptography. This isn't  theory for him. It_ mission-critical work  and he_ built his career preparing for exactly this moment.

  I didn_ realize how explicit a reference it is to Karl Marx_ philosophy that the proletariat should and will seize land and factories via violent revolution.  Aka violent communism, the type that_ killed more people than nazi_sm or any form of authoritarianism in history.  

  As a concept, it was at least somewhat sensible when Marx wrote it.  Most of capital was land 400 years ago and eventually a decent amount was factories.  And impoverished farm laborers could reasonably hope to seize farmland and earn a better living.   The land owners weren_ obviously contributing much value.  Painting them as lucky leeches had truth in many cases.  Even then, Marx_ policies failed catastrophically and starved millions  of the agricultural workers but at least it kind of made sense as an idea.  

  Today the idea is completely nonsensical.  What is it you_e going to seize?  The NYC bodegas?  Most of the _apital today is valuable because of knowledge workers.

2025-07-02,positive,"My take on ICE/immigration, a bit nuanced.  

For 30+ years, US immigration has been this bizarre _ame where the right promises secure borders but generally eagerly lets undocumented migrants enter to serve business interests that want cheap labor.

And the left claims moral high ground while refusing to provide documents to these migrants for similar reason, their business lobbyists want to continue exploiting them.

And that pattern continues today.  Rationally the left should be demanding to provide documents and a clear path to citizenship for undocumented migrants.  Some do, but it_ largely lip service as we keep seeing when Dems control congress and presidency.  And today the focus is on exploiting undocumented migrants as a moral claim for votes rather than taking concrete action to help them.  

The right_ violation of due process, hateful rhetoric, and abusive treatment of migrants is inhumane.  

The solution seems simple and obvious (albeit difficult to implement.)  We should have perfectly secure borders, and welcome in those immigrants we choose to, and treat those immigrants well with clear path to citizenship.  For undocumented immigrants already here, we need to deport those that can_ or won_ integrate to society (mostly the violent lawbreakers), and provide documentation and a path to citizenship to the rest.  

The effect of immigration on a country is largely determined by two things - the immigrants and how they_e integrated into society.  The same immigrant may become a valuable contributing member of society in the right context, or a violent thief when forced to survive beyond the fringe of society.

1) Revalue the gold strategic reserve to market price, sell it for cash

2) Nationalise MSTR, ideally when mNAV is low during a bear market, pay out all shareholders fairvalue. This is bulk BTC purchase without driving up the BTC price.

3) MSTR holders would now need to scamble to buy back their BTC exposure driving up the price exponentially.

4) Buy BTC with remaining cash

5) Announce X-prize style competition to the US private space industry to mine near earth asteroids for commodities

This puts long term bearish pressure on gold strategic reserves to US competitors (China) and will drive a long term rush for BTC which is stacked early by the US.",2025-07-03 20:04:00+00:00,488.0,213.0,2175.0,4065.0

2025-07-04,neutral,"Prior to Trump_ first election, politics in America was often framed (at least by academics, social scientists, and the left) as corporate interests vs everyone else.  At its most simplified, as rich vs poor.  It_ still often framed this way, but I_l argue that_ been completely proven false as least as relates to the current politics.  

   Trump was opposed by the vast majority of elites.  Corporate elites, academic elites, military elites, etc.  He rose to power as a populist.  Today his coalition includes a great many elites of different types, particularly corporate, but his power still springs from populism.  

   Democrats had a tenuous populist lead prior to Trump, with sharp advantages among underprivileged minorities, the poor, and a lead with women, but all have shrunk dramatically.  

   The framing most often pushed in US schools is that _he people push for _ood things like environmental regulations, more wealth redistribution, more money to long-term investment like education.  And it_ corporate interests and the rich who oppose these things. 

   Today, I_l argue it_ closer to the opposite (although reality is more nuanced.)

   The _ringe non-elites of both left and right are the base for racism, short-sighted economic policies, and generally destructive and selfish tribalism today.  These _ringes can be simplified to the Islamists and Marxists on the left, and white nationalists on the right.  They_e fringes in that they represent a minority of their own parties, but have outsized power because they turn out in the primaries that determine most officeholders and almost always have <10% turnout.  (To explain this point for a moment, most districts in the US are clearly GOP or democrat, partly due to gerrymandering.  That means the real election is the primary.  And when primary turnout is <10%, it_ largely the fringes and special interests who determine the outcome, because they turn out, moderates stay home.)

  Today, the root of support for _lligator Alcatraz, Islamist authoritarianism, and destructive and openly racist Marxist policies_re all non-elites.  Elites largely oppose all these things as counterproductive to basically everyone.  

  In short, we have populism on both the left and the right dominating political decision making.  It_ why our political leaders on both left and right can barely go a sentence without tribal signaling and identity politics framings.     And _he people turning out in primaries of both left and right are largely pushing for tribal grabs - things that benefit their _ribe at least optically, to the detriment of the country (and often themselves.)

   Why would people demand policies bad for themselves?  Complex topic, but often it_ because of zero sum thinking, short time preferences, and political capture.

  Short time preferences here refers to political activism optimizing for the quick power win.  For example, some progressives pushed for a censorship czar under Biden without optimizing for what that role would mean under a Trump presidency and vice versa.  

  And by political capture, I mean that elites always exploit populist movements for their own gains, often by twisting the specific policies.  For example, _ough on crime gets monetized by for-profit prisons that lobby heavily, with results not necessarily aligned with the _ough on crime advocates.  Empathy for refugees gets monetized by thousands of non-profits and for-profits that capture a large % of the spending for themselves.

I realized we needed to build build a cold storage system to improve security (otherwise a single hot wallet breach would mean we were insolvent and the company would die), and called the two cryptography/security experts I knew (@zooko and @octal if memory serves) and asked them what the best architecture would be. They were super helpful and gave me a crash course, since I had never built such a system before. I asked them how long it would take to build and I remember one of them said it might take a team of ~10 people 18 months to get it all up and running and tested.

The problem was we had about 8 weeks until the total deposits on the platform would exceed the total assets of the company, and only 2 engineers (including myself) to build it. We were seeing signs that hackers were already trying to break in, a true do or die moment.

@satoshilite and I buckled down and set about coding the new cold storage system from scratch, and integrating it into the app. We made some reasonable trade offs but what we came up with was fundamentally secure, and a massive improvement. We even unboxed some new laptops for key generation, stored backup material across several safe deposit boxes and locations. With about a week remaining, we started the process of transferring funds over to the new system. We were both extremely sleep deprived (how mistakes happen!), and paired up to double check each others work as we sent over the first test transaction, then a bigger one, and so on until it was fully transferred.

Our work is personal to me (though many have asked: Why? Aren't you into intuition and taste and experience which is ultimately unmeasurable?)

But hear me out: I love building, and I have a deep respect for it. Making something people love is one of the hardest and most humbling endeavors.

The art comes down to making high-quality decisions, which comes from an obsession with the cliff_ edge between customer understanding and product capability.

You need to know what_ working and what isn_.

That_ why data matters. Data is *information* about how reality works. At Sundial, we live by the mantra: diagnose with data; treat with design.

What does masterful decision-making look like? It comes down to 3 things:
1. extreme alignment
2. shared curiosity to unpeel deeper and deeper layers of truth
3. urgent execution

The very fact is that good intuition and taste comes from data internalized across many, many reps. 

Yes, reality is infinitely more complex than what can be measured. But measuring gives us a better grasp of reality.

Alas, using data well is like learning a new language. It requires years of skill and context building. It's easy to misuse, whether misguidedly or intentionally. I know this all too well.

Mastery requires everything from how to break down an ambiguous question, to fluently reading triangle charts and dense tables, to remembering the specific name of a specific column using a specific dialect of SQL.

Too many people, like me, regularly feel frustrated by 
a) how long it takes to get answers 
b) how to draw the right interpretations 
c) how much noise I have to wade through to find actually actionable insights.

Instead of greater confidence and quality, we get conflicting signals, cherry-picked facts, and analysis paralysis.

Sundial is our attempt to solve those problems.

We_e bottling up opinionated intelligence to guide decision-makers towards faster and more confident decisions. We envision a world where *everyone* can be their own expert analyst.

Sundial uses AI and expert analytical techniques to make insights accessible to every decision-maker. Exemplary analysis takes the listener through a story. Data should speak the language of business, not the other way around.

Sundial is also smart in the ways you_ expect of an AI-native tool. It_ not just about looking up data (_hat_ India ARR last month?), which has become table stakes; rather, Sundial can also tackle deep, complex analysis (_hy did ARR decline? What are my levers?).

In a crowded landscape of fragmented data tools_ashboards, notebooks, ETL systems_undial brings it all together into one intuitive platform.

We believe this era of AI will see teams doing far more with less, and moving faster than ever before.

Our mission is to build the data brain for the next generation of AI-powered companies.

We're thrilled to be backed by @dpatil at GPV_he first U.S. Chief Data Scientist and coiner of the term ""data scientist, alongside industry luminaries like @amasad, @tobi, @fidjissimo, @alexschultz, @shishirmehrotra, @rsanghvi, @avichal, @drewhouston, @howietl and firms including @sequoia, @TribeCapital_,  @sunflowercptl, @Unusual_VC.

The best part of building Sundial is the people we get to work with. Funding announcements are nice and all, but what really fuels us is the feedback and growth trajectory of our customers.

There_ nothing better than working on interesting problems with people you like.

Onward!

Too many people, like me, regularly feel frustrated by 
a) how long it takes to get answers 
b) how to draw the right interpretations 
c) how much noise I have to wade through to find actually actionable insights.

Instead of greater confidence and quality, we get conflicting signals, cherry-picked facts, and analysis paralysis.

Sundial is our attempt to solve those problems.

We_e bottling up opinionated intelligence to guide decision-makers towards faster and more confident decisions. We envision a world where *everyone* can be their own expert analyst.

Sundial uses AI and expert analytical techniques to make insights accessible to every decision-maker. Exemplary analysis takes the listener through a story. Data should speak the language of business, not the other way around.

Sundial is also smart in the ways you_ expect of an AI-native tool. It_ not just about looking up data (_hat_ India ARR last month?), which has become table stakes; rather, Sundial can also tackle deep, complex analysis (_hy did ARR decline? What are my levers?).

In a crowded landscape of fragmented data tools_ashboards, notebooks, ETL systems_undial brings it all together into one intuitive platform.

We believe this era of AI will see teams doing far more with less, and moving faster than ever before.

Our mission is to build the data brain for the next generation of AI-powered companies.

We're thrilled to be backed by @dpatil at GPV_he first U.S. Chief Data Scientist and coiner of the term ""data scientist, alongside industry luminaries like @amasad, @tobi, @fidjissimo, @alexschultz, @shishirmehrotra, @rsanghvi, @avichal, @drewhouston, @howietl and firms including @sequoia, @TribeCapital_,  @sunflowercptl, @Unusual_VC.

The best part of building Sundial is the people we get to work with. Funding announcements are nice and all, but what really fuels us is the feedback and growth trajectory of our customers.

There_ nothing better than working on interesting problems with people you like.

Onward!

(P.S. We_e hiring for AI engineers, data engineers, and data scientists in the Bay Area -- DM me if you resonate with our mission, love dissecting big problems down into smaller ones, and appreciate the consistent practice of craft.)",2025-07-08 15:03:00+00:00,67.0,37.0,748.0,1023.0

A few weeks later, my sister was looking for a job and I introduced her to Olaf. She wasn't super interested as she was thinking of starting her own startup. But my conversation with Olaf eventually led to him asking why don't I go in for an interview. At the time, I was working comfortably at Google, but Google had no interest in doing anything with crypto. So I decided why not.

At my interview, @brian_armstrong and @FEhrsam asked me quite a few tough brain teasers and coding questions. They didn't know I could do brain teasers in my sleep. _ The interview quickly went from trying to test me to trying to sell me on Coinbase. It actually didn't take much to sell me. I get to work on crypto full time, working with super bright and talented people, and building a company that is trying to change the world of finance.

Coinbase made me a decent offer, but the pay was a lot less than my pay at Google. I decided to negotiate for more salary instead of more stock, because I wanted Coinbase to at least match my Google salary of $150k. Not negotiating for more COIN stock was the single worst financial decision of my life! _

I got my email account back!

Proton acted very professionally and froze the account immediately after my report, so the hackers couldn't access the account anymore.

Also, damage seems minimal, because Proton encrypts email content and attachments (so the hackers couldn't see email contents and attachments, only email addresses from/to and subject) and I didn't have any other accounts connected to this email.

So what happened? Many people were quick to accuse me of clicking a phishing mail, having a weak password, having malware on my computer, or similar user slip-up (see comments). But that is not what happened. The hackers abused the password recovery process. As per proton: ""the attackers seemed to have directly targeted your account and knew specific details about it, which they used to interact with customer support and gain access to it"". 

What I could have done better was enabling 2FA. I do have 2FA on all social media and exchange accounts etc, but not on this email.

It's Roman Storm here. As my trial begins on July 14, we're facing an unexpected hurdle: __
What started as a planned 2-week trial is now expected to last 3-4 weeks due to complex legal arguments and unforeseen witnesses and evidence.

This means higher expenses for expert testimonies, thorough research, and my committed legal team. ___

I'm pushing to raise an additional $1.5M as our updated fundraising target to sustain this fight. ��_
Your support truly matters in safeguarding creativity and privacy from undue interference. _��_

I'm truly grateful for all the support and love I've received during this ordeal.

2025-07-11,all,"Follow-up since I informed/warned about the hack :
I got my email account back!

Proton acted very professionally and froze the account immediately after my report, so the hackers couldn't access the account anymore.

Also, damage seems minimal, because Proton encrypts email content and attachments (so the hackers couldn't see email contents and attachments, only email addresses from/to and subject) and I didn't have any other accounts connected to this email.

So what happened? Many people were quick to accuse me of clicking a phishing mail, having a weak password, having malware on my computer, or similar user slip-up (see comments). But that is not what happened. The hackers abused the password recovery process. As per proton: ""the attackers seemed to have directly targeted your account and knew specific details about it, which they used to interact with customer support and gain access to it"". 

What I could have done better was enabling 2FA. I do have 2FA on all social media and exchange accounts etc, but not on this email. This is an old 2019 email account that I had set up after I wrote S2F article and became active on Twitter (now X). I mainly used it to communicate with Twitter followers.

2025-07-17,neutral,"The short version of crypto week as of Thursday AM for those trying to follow the chaos in Congress:

The House is trying to pass three bills this week  GENIUS (stablecoins), CLARITY (market structure), and Anti-CBDC (self-explanatory). GENIUS already passed the Senate, so if it passes the House, it goes to the President and becomes law. CLARITY and Anti-CBDC are new in the House, so would move on to the Senate.

On Tuesday, the House Freedom Caucus and others blocked a procedural vote to advance the bills for a variety of reasons, but mainly over CBDCs, which they despise. The concern was that the Anti-CBDC bill wasn't prioritized enough and might fail even while GENIUS and CLARITY pass.

On Wednesday, a deal was struck to include the Anti-CBDC bill in a must-pass bill, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House then voted 217 - 212 in favor of moving forward on all three bills. That vote took 10 hours, the longest vote in modern House history.

Now this morning, the House is back to debate and vote on GENIUS and CLARITY. The President has a signing ceremony scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) and everyone expects GENIUS to be on his desk by then, so hopes are high for stablecoin legislation to be done today. CLARITY will likely slip to next week.

2025-07-17,all,"The short version of crypto week as of Thursday AM for those trying to follow the chaos in Congress:

The House is trying to pass three bills this week  GENIUS (stablecoins), CLARITY (market structure), and Anti-CBDC (self-explanatory). GENIUS already passed the Senate, so if it passes the House, it goes to the President and becomes law. CLARITY and Anti-CBDC are new in the House, so would move on to the Senate.

On Tuesday, the House Freedom Caucus and others blocked a procedural vote to advance the bills for a variety of reasons, but mainly over CBDCs, which they despise. The concern was that the Anti-CBDC bill wasn't prioritized enough and might fail even while GENIUS and CLARITY pass.

On Wednesday, a deal was struck to include the Anti-CBDC bill in a must-pass bill, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House then voted 217 - 212 in favor of moving forward on all three bills. That vote took 10 hours, the longest vote in modern House history.

Now this morning, the House is back to debate and vote on GENIUS and CLARITY. The President has a signing ceremony scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) and everyone expects GENIUS to be on his desk by then, so hopes are high for stablecoin legislation to be done today. CLARITY will likely slip to next week.

At the White House today, the first piece of U.S. crypto legislation will be signed into law: the GENIUS Act. It provides clear rules for stablecoins.

This is a historic moment  not just for crypto, but for the world at large. That_ because stablecoins give us something we_e never really had before: open money infrastructure.

Stablecoins are a better form of money: faster, cheaper, and more global. They cut fees and eliminate intermediaries. They are auditable and programmable. They allow developers to build new kinds of apps that weren_ possible before: low-to-no cost remittances, programmatic micropayments, AI-native transactions, transparent and disintermediated global commerce, and more.

Stablecoins give the world access to the dollar, they spread financial freedom, and they ensure that the next generation of financial infrastructure is built on U.S. standards.

For too long, innovators in crypto have operated under legal uncertainty. That uncertainty has stifled progress, driven builders offshore, and created a fragmented internet. The GENIUS Act reverses this: it creates clarity for stablecoins and sets us on a path toward broader crypto market structure reforms.

This is how the internet moves forward: through clear rule-making. With the GENIUS Act, stablecoins have clear rules, paving the way for better payments, financial products, and an overhaul of the global financial system.

Next, we need the same for the rest of the crypto market. The Senate can do this by passing the CLARITY Act, which provides clear rules of the road for the broader crypto industry, opening a path for innovators while also protecting consumers from scams and bad actors.

We believe that the U.S. can lead the next era of the internet  the read-write-own era  by enabling open, user-owned protocols instead of the closed, corporate platforms that defined the last one. This legislation lays the foundation for that future. It's the beginning of a new chapter.",2025-07-18 15:50:00+00:00,108.0,114.0,628.0,1180.0

2025-07-22,positive,"Excited to announce we_e leading a $15M seed round in Poseidon, which was incubated by @StoryProtocol and is building a decentralized data layer to coordinate supply and demand for AI training data.

The first generation of AI foundation models were trained on data that seemed to be an effectively unlimited resource. Today, the most accessible resources such as books and websites have mostly been exhausted, and data has become a limiting factor in AI progress.

Much of the data that remains now is either lower quality or off-limits due to IP protections. For some of the most promising AI applications  across robotics, autonomous vehicles, and spatial intelligence  the data doesn_ even exist yet. Now these systems need entirely new types of information: multi-sensory, rich in edge cases, captured in the wild. Where will all this physical-world data  come from?

The challenge isn't just technical  it_ a problem of coordination. Thousands of contributors must work together in a distributed way to source, label, and maintain the physical data that next-gen AI needs. We believe no centralized approach can efficiently orchestrate the data creation and curation that_ needed at the required level of scale and diversity. A decentralized approach can solve this.

@psdnai allows suppliers to collect the data AI companies need, while ensuring IP safety via Story_ programmable IP license. This seeks to establish a new economic foundation for the internet, where data creators get fairly compensated for helping AI companies power the next generation of intelligent systems.

Poseidon_ team, led by Chief Scientist and Cofounder @SPChinchali, brings deep expertise in AI infrastructure. Sandeep is a professor at UT Austin specializing in AI, robotics, and distributed systems, with a PhD from Stanford in AI and distributed systems. Head of Product and Cofounder @sarickshah spent a decade as a machine learning engineer, scaling AI products for large enterprises across financial services, telecom, and healthcare.

2025-07-22,all,"Excited to announce we_e leading a $15M seed round in Poseidon, which was incubated by @StoryProtocol and is building a decentralized data layer to coordinate supply and demand for AI training data.

The first generation of AI foundation models were trained on data that seemed to be an effectively unlimited resource. Today, the most accessible resources such as books and websites have mostly been exhausted, and data has become a limiting factor in AI progress.

Much of the data that remains now is either lower quality or off-limits due to IP protections. For some of the most promising AI applications  across robotics, autonomous vehicles, and spatial intelligence  the data doesn_ even exist yet. Now these systems need entirely new types of information: multi-sensory, rich in edge cases, captured in the wild. Where will all this physical-world data  come from?

The challenge isn't just technical  it_ a problem of coordination. Thousands of contributors must work together in a distributed way to source, label, and maintain the physical data that next-gen AI needs. We believe no centralized approach can efficiently orchestrate the data creation and curation that_ needed at the required level of scale and diversity. A decentralized approach can solve this.

@psdnai allows suppliers to collect the data AI companies need, while ensuring IP safety via Story_ programmable IP license. This seeks to establish a new economic foundation for the internet, where data creators get fairly compensated for helping AI companies power the next generation of intelligent systems.

Poseidon_ team, led by Chief Scientist and Cofounder @SPChinchali, brings deep expertise in AI infrastructure. Sandeep is a professor at UT Austin specializing in AI, robotics, and distributed systems, with a PhD from Stanford in AI and distributed systems. Head of Product and Cofounder @sarickshah spent a decade as a machine learning engineer, scaling AI products for large enterprises across financial services, telecom, and healthcare.

We are excited to support Poseidon in its work to solve one of the most critical bottlenecks in AI development.",2025-07-22 16:18:00+00:00,103.0,65.0,447.0,886.0

2025-07-24,positive,"It's finally happening!

Today, we're launching @moremarketsxyz on mainnet with our first flagship earn account: the XRP Earn Account.

This is the first-ever on-chain XRP product with yield sourced from @Ripple's own stablecoin, RLUSD, through protocols like @aave.

@moremarketsxyz_ vision is to open up yield strategies that have traditionally been accessible only to the wealthy and hedge funds.

We chose XRP as the first asset because:

(i) it_ beloved by retail investors,
(ii) it currently lacks native yield, and
(iii) it represents a user base that has been largely underserved by the growing world of DeFi.

We designed the app to be as simple as possible:

(i) You can log in using your social credentials or via @xamanwallet, a well-known wallet brand in the XRP community.

(ii) Once logged in, all you need to do is on-ramp funds and deposit into your XRP account.

Traditionally, these steps would require 34 different front-ends to swap, bridge, and deposit, but @moremarketsxyz handles it all in a single interface, with one button, thanks to partners like @nearprotocol and @wormhole.

Opening XRP strategies to retail is just the beginning. We're already working on several more products, some designed to generate yield on staked assets, others targeting yields not yet available on-chain.

Crypto remains the best vehicle for unlocking financial opportunity, especially for those historically excluded from the privileges the wealthy take for granted.

I'm excited that @moremarketsxyz will play a role in changing that.

2025-08-05,neutral,"wow, been a wild ride to mainnet.

some fun facts: uma and i started in 2021 working on zk bridging, until we realized the real problem wasn't bridging itself, it was that using zk was so horrendously complex that nobody could actually build with it.

we pivoted to making it possible to prove any piece of software.

i think we were one of the first teams to show that the risc-v zkvm approach was endgame. it's nice to see teams like zksync, scroll, and even ethereum now agree it's the right approach.

with this mainnet launch, we finally have the ingredients for easy-to-use, low-cost proving that teams need to scale zk in production. i'm also really excited to keep working with the talented hardware teams and provers who are tirelessly pushing to make zk 10-100x cheaper, which should onboard basically every crypto infra protocol to zk in the near future.

thank you to everyone who got us here: paradigm, the early adopters, and the oss developers who believed in the vision.

We_e also partnered with some of the largest and best accounting firms in the country, including @Armanino_HQ, @wissllp and Attivo. The whole industry has been begging for change for decades. With Rillet, it_ here.

This round came together very quickly. The first call happened while I was eating a tuna sandwich in SF (I did not finish it). Three days later, we had a signed term sheet. It was a reflection of the momentum we_e seeing both in the product and in the market. Since announcing our Series A just weeks ago, we_e already doubled our ARR.

None of this would be possible without our team of accountants and engineers. A few months ago, I was still jumping on support calls to help customers.

On the critical question of which tokens should be regulated as securities, the Senate's draft takes a very different approach from the CLARITY Act that was already passed in the House. 

We think the Senate's approach""ancillary assets""_s better for crypto.

While both bills are an improvement on the Howey-based regime_hich is notoriously difficult to apply and creates toxic perverse incentives for issuers_he Senate draft is significantly simpler, and avoids forcing decentralized tokens and protocols to fit themselves into an inflexible legislative framework.

Instead, it protects against abuse with a simple exclusion_ssets that come with legal rights to specified financial interests do not qualify as ancillary assets. 

As we explain in the letter, we think this is the cleanest test that protects decentralized crypto assets while preventing traditional securities issuers from improperly taking advantage of this framework.",2025-08-07 15:38:00+00:00,31.0,32.0,168.0,325.0

@ETHZilla_ATNF is launching a community-oriented $ETH treasury vehicle, aiming to optimize yield generation and serve as a gateway to TradFi and the bonds market.

Worth noting: Its chairman has opted not to use leverage due to potential drawdowns in #Ethereum price, which could trigger a nasty forced liquidation spiral in a bear market. However, the recent issuance of convertible notes raises questions about whether this intention will be fully respected.

PRESS RELEASE: Electric Capital will serve as the external asset manager for the Company, and plans to implement a differentiated, on-chain yield generation program. This program will be designed with the goal of outperforming traditional ETH staking, while maintaining robust risk management, seeking to leverage a combination of staking, lending, liquidity provisioning and bespoke private agreements.

@Etherealize_io, together with a consortium of leading DeFi builders and pioneers, will advise ETHZilla on using its treasury to optimize yields. 

_ur strategy aims to give investors exposure to a high-yield ecosystem in the stablecoin and tokenized asset markets, McAndrew Rudisill said, estimating returns of high single to low double digits on the company_ $ETH.

As mentioned, the company also intends to avoid relying on debt financing for its $ETH acquisition. @avichal from EC has also expressed concerns about this risk in recent interviews.

Rudisill stated that: ""There will be a point in the cycle where maybe Ether runs to $15,000 and pulls back to $10,000. That_ still a 33% drawdown. We don_ want to be levered for that.""

I_e reviewed recent filings and here_ what I found �__

- Formerly 180 Life Sciences, now fully rebranding into an ETHZilla. Announced major shift in business model but plan to continue its legacy core business operations, including in biotech and iGaming

- McAndrew Rudisill, appointed Chairman before August 4 2025, is Founder & Managing Partner of Harbor Island Equity Partners, LLC and former CIO & Director of Bridger Aerospace.

- Rudisill holds 563,035 shares and 4,807,873 warrants at $2.775.

- Jordan Blair is the CEO & director, and 10% owner of ETHZilla. He owns 1,888,742 shares and 3,908,986 options at $2.92 (granted on July 29, 2025).

- Ryan Lewis Smith is the Lead Independent Director, holding 167,181 shares and 3,908,986 options at $2.92 (granted on July 29, 2025).

- Appointment of Andrew Suckling and Crystal Heter as directors on August 4, 2025, with annual compensation of $350'000 each. No shares. Both are independent directors with capital markets and crypto expertise.

- Grant of 919,761 options to Stephen H. Shoemaker (board member), exercise price $2.92.

- 154,032,084 $ATNF shares post-PIPE.

- PIPE shares (142,882,173 shares) are not unlocked yet. They require an effective Initial Registration Statement, expected as early as August 15, 2025 (if no review) or as late as October 3, 2025 (if reviewed)

- The 17,495,849 pre-funded warrants can be exercised immediately but the resulting shares require registration before they can be resold.

- Buyback of 1,318,000 shares from Elray Resources for $650,000, under a Settlement and Release Agreement dated April 23, 2024. At $0.493 per share.

��_ Given:

- Implied mNAV of 1.06 at $3;
- Limited downside risk after PIPE shares reg;
- Very low float;
- Insiders holdings and strong incentive for success;
- Intention to avoid debt financing;
- Partnering with yield generation experts;
- Possible issuance of instruments suited for MM;
- Clean balance sheet;
- $BMNR ran $3 to $161 on $250M news;
- The cool rebrand

I believe $ATNF is under the radar right now and I've started building a position at today's price level.

Things I will keep an eye on __

- Weapon of choice to raise capital. Limited trading volumes make ATM dilution unlikly and push management toward direct offerings and possibly IPOs - similar to what @Strategy did with $STRC. This needs to happen really quick. The recent issuance of $165M in convertible notes contradicts Rudisill_ statement about not using debt.

- Added risk associated with DeFi strategies, if disclosed.

- Target in terms of $ETH acquisition.

2025-08-12,positive,"With the worst kept secret and news finally out that Circle & Stripe will be building their own L1 blockchains, I wanted to provide some thoughts on why our strategy has been focused on being the platform that enables L1 blockchain launches.

After the Robinhood announcement, CT did what it does - all the podcasters and naval gazers quickly re-pivoted back to _very institution will launch an L2 & _nsitutions chose Ethereum because Tom Lee. This was always nonsense because Robinhood considered many architectures, not all were L2s. The reality is and has been for a while that there will be millions of blockchains and there will be a mix of  L2s and L1s. It_ also true that many L2s will eventually graduate into becoming L1s.  If you are an institution with what may seem like unlimited resources, the thought of tying yourself and your infrastructure choice to the incumbents seems very risky! What if Ethereum, Arbitrum or Avalanche botches an upgrade and their business is interrupted? For many, this is a show stopper. Remember, there are still so many banks that use on-prem vs cloud

In addition, and I know people don_ want to hear this but, building an L1 does provide the ability to launch a token. The opportunity set of launching a token for an L1 that gets widely adopted is massive. Hyperliquid is a $42B FDV for one use case. How many other levers can a Stripe or Circle pull for that kind of marketcap? This is and has always been a key weakness for L2s and do not try and shill me your committee based nonsense. 

There is a reason Avalanche has built a network that allows for builders and enterprises to launch their own L1 blockchains, there is a market for it! That much is clear as well with FIFA, Maplestory & Gunzilla choosing to build on @avax. While Avalanche was not selected for these two (although it was at the top of the list for one of them), it validates the thesis that there will be many L1 blockchains and Avalanche can power that. It is not uncommon in the beginning of a new market for new entrants to want to build and own the whole stack, but history shows us that this is simply a detour, rather than a lasting trend. Seeing Stripe, Circle and Hyperliquid build their own L1 blockchains is great validation for the thesis that there will be millions of blockchains and Avalanche can power many of them.",2025-08-12 11:55:00+00:00,53.0,102.0,407.0,770.0

2025-08-17,positive,"3/ Researchers trained an AI model that can decode inner monologue from brain activity with up to 74% accuracy, demonstrating for the first time that silent, self-directed thoughts have a distinct neural signature that can be detected in real time.

Using microelectrodes implanted in the motor cortex of four people with paralysis from ALS or brainstem stroke, the team asked participants to either attempt speech or imagine saying words. Although both conditions activated overlapping speech-planning circuits, inner monologue generated patterns that the AI model could separate from attempted speech, enabling it to decode imagined words from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.

Inner monologue works by activating the same motor and language networks that drive spoken speech, but it stops short of engaging auditory feedback or the fine motor control required for articulation.

European companies such as Klarna, Arm, and Wise have chosen to list in New York, drawn by the unmatched scale and liquidity of American markets.

One key difference lies in household savings, as U.S. families channel wealth into equities through 401K accounts and mutual funds, creating steady demand for new listings, while European households save more overall but keep about 70% of their $12 trillion in deposits or bonds, leaving less capital for domestic markets.

That weaker flow into equities reduces household wealth, which in turn reinforces the cycle of weaker markets.

U.S. firms also trade at ~22x earnings compared with ~13x for the FTSE 100 (UK_ best-known stock market index), giving companies the ability to raise more money while giving up less equity. Moreover, American exchanges operate under unified rules, where disclosure standards, investor protections, and listing requirements are consistent across the market, giving companies clarity and scale.

1/ The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that CPI increased 2.7% over the past year and 0.2% in July, broadly in line with expectations and signaling that inflation at the household level is steady.

By contrast, PPI (producer prices) increased 3.3% year over year, with a 0.9% monthly increase that was the largest in several years and well above forecasts of 0.3% to 0.4%. What_ going on? CPI is calculated from a representative basket of goods and services, weighted by typical household spending, while PPI measures the prices producers and wholesalers receive for goods and services, from raw materials to finished products.

The distinction is that CPI reflects the consumer_ perspective, what households are paying, while PPI reflects the producer_ perspective, what businesses are charging or receiving. Because producer costs often flow through to consumers, a strong PPI can foreshadow upward pressure on CPI, though the link is not one-to-one as businesses can absorb costs rather than passing them along.

Whether businesses absorb higher costs or pass them on depends on their pricing power, the strength of demand, competitive pressures, their margins, and whether they see the cost increase as temporary or lasting.

It is also important to note that PPI figures are often revised in subsequent months as more data are collected, while CPI data are rarely revised beyond methodological changes.

For CPI, BLS field staff directly record prices from stores, service providers, landlords, and utility companies each month, and nearly all of that data arrive before the release deadline, so the numbers are locked in. For PPI, the BLS depends more on businesses submitting survey forms about what they charged for goods and services, and because not all firms respond in time, the initial release is based on partial data that get updated as late reports come in. In any case, while consumer inflation is stable, the sharp jump in producer prices bears watching, as it may hint at higher CPI in the upcoming months.",2025-08-17 18:28:00+00:00,53.0,44.0,493.0,740.0

The U.S. needs buyers for short-term debt. Tether steps in, scoops up the bonds, collects the interest and uses that yield to buy Bitcoin.

Initially, our first go to market was to try and build a transpiler to take CUDA workloads to other silicon targets - Inferentia, Cerebras, Groq etc. at equivalent or better performance.

That path turned out to be a technical dead end. So we pivoted. 

When talking to potential customers, their pain point was consistently the same: they wanted more efficiency and coordination:

Years of point tools stitched together created an inefficient development process. Lots of tools, lots of cost, poor coordination, high error bars on deliverability and low accountability were consistently cited. 

So we decided to build them a software factory.

Our Software Factory is made up of five modules. The modules can be used by a technical super user but it_ best when used in a small team working together where certain folks are assigned responsibility for certain modules. 

You and your teammates work through each module to get software to production. 

Some modules use AI as part of the solution. Other parts just use it behind the scenes to deliver deterministic outputs faster. 

The result is something that, in the last year, has seen good adoption amongst a large set of important companies and is something that new teams have found especially valuable in getting off the ground faster. 

Our Software Factory has five modules:

1. Refinery - for PMs, Designers and Engineers to be able to collaboratively create a full featured PRD. 

2. Foundry - for Engineers and Eng Managers to have a set of Eng plans (aka Blueprints) automatically generated for them from the PRD. Edit and change what you want/need. 

3. Planner - for an Engineer/Eng Manager to have a set of coherent Work Orders automatically generated for them from the PRD/Eng Plan. 

4. Assembler - for Engineers to take a set of well written Work Orders and do it yourself or direct a coding agent to do it for you. 

5. Validator - for PMs and Engineers to implement visibility and traceability throughout the code and get a simple dashboard to see if there is drift or not. 

That_ it.

We can now back-propagate from legacy code we_e never seen into an accurate architecture blueprint (and PRD) in one shot. Then you can go forward with new features on legacy code adhering to the architecture.

But along the way, the vision has become clearer. It_ more than just cost and speed. It_ global availability, on every chain you want to use. It_ built-in exchange, so you can pay with anything. It_ deep liquidity, that_ there when you need it most. It_ reliable execution, that works every time.

We call the sum of all of these pieces a _ayments UX. If the world is going to come onchain, the experience needs to match or exceed how online payments work today. It_ Relay_ mission to build the liquidity backbone for this onchain economy. To build a multichain payments network.

While many people might think of Relay as an app, there_ so much more going on behind the scenes. The best apps in the space are using Relay to power their consumer applications because nothing else hits the same level of quality on all dimensions. Chain abstraction. Commerce. App onboarding. Swaps. If the experience is delightful, it_ probably Relay under the hood.

For a sense of Relay_ scale, check out the Etherscan tx sender leaderboard. On Ethereum, we_e always in the top 10. On Base, we_e currently number 1, sending ~350k txs in the past 7 days. You won_ see us on the gas guzzlers though, we_e too efficient!

2025-08-27,neutral,"Whenever I have an opportunity to partner with a brilliant technologist to build something special, I do so.

A few years ago, Matt Stroud (my brilliant cofounder) set out to rebuild the heat pump. Here is a summary of our company: @Icebox_Energy 

Problem Statement: 
We are building an end-to-end cooling solution for data centers using CO2.

Why:
Next-generation HPC/AI processors produce heat beyond the capabilities of traditional cooling. Only four viable options exist: two-phase immersion cooling (impractical and environmentally hazardous), impinged water jets (complex and leak-risky), two-phase refrigerant cold plates (environmentally concerning), and Icebox Energy_ CO-based solution. Our single-loop CO system simplifies design, reduces risks, and significantly lowers costs while providing higher reliability, easier maintenance, and better scalability.

Emerging HPC/AI processors produce more heat than can be managed by state-of-the-art air or liquid cooling systems. Future data center builds will require advanced cooling solutions to handle both the extreme heat density of these next-generation processors and rapidly increasing rack power levels_urrently around 140 kW and soon reaching 1 MW. Compounding this challenge is limited grid power availability, making it essential that advanced cooling solutions become more efficient_reeing up additional power for computing workloads.

There are only four practical cooling options capable of handling these demands: two-phase immersion cooling and three direct-to-chip (cold plate) solutions_mpinged water jets, two-phase refrigerant cold plates, and Icebox Energy_ CO-based technology.

Two-phase immersion cooling is unlikely to scale effectively. Although it delivers impressive energy performance, immersion requires submerging entire servers into sealed vats filled with fluorinated chemicals, making it impractical and posing significant environmental and health risks. This leaves the three cold plate options.

Impinged water jet cold plates utilize water, but managing water chemistry and high flow rates for these applications is challenging, and leaks pose serious risks to IT equipment.

Two-phase refrigerant cold plates rely on the same fluorinated chemicals (HFOs) used in immersion cooling, though in much smaller quantities. While the environmental impact is reduced, concerns around safety, cost, and long-term regulatory restrictions remain.

Both impinged water jet and two-phase refrigerant cold plates require multiple cooling loops, introducing additional points of potential failure and increasing heat losses.

Icebox Energy's system transfers heat from the server directly to its heat pump in a single loop. Operating at pressures similar to those in restaurant soda fountains and grocery store refrigeration systems, the direct and pressurized CO approach eliminates numerous components, such as pumps and heat exchangers, significantly reducing the size and complexity of the cooling system. CO can carry 10x the heat compared to water in half the size and is 30x denser than HFOs, allowing smaller return lines. As a result, the system is more compact, uses significantly less coolant, and costs substantially less than systems using HFOs._Our CO system also provides numerous additional advantages, including enhanced reliability, simplified maintenance, and greater scalability.

We can support all proposed coolant temps in all climates._ Our tech offers the lowest PUE at the best price and highest reliability (5-9s+).

2025-08-28,positive,"The institutional era of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly. 

Stablecoins are exploding. They move trillions every year and are rapidly becoming the backbone of global finance. They rival Visa and Mastercard in settlement volume and are on track to surpass them. RWAs are thriving, merging with DeFi in ways we previously only dreamed of.

These innovations are the bridge between fiat and crypto. Stablecoins will become the settlement layer of DeFi.  They are the clearest path to mainstream crypto adoption.

As stablecoins expand into payments, remittances, and even, one day, sovereign currencies, the foundations that enable them must evolve. The industry and its partners need speed, predictability, compliance, and connectivity.

This is what sets Avalanche apart.
Avalanche delivers fast finality, low fees, and decoupled horizontal scalability without compromising on the most core tenant of our movement, decentralization. Most importantly, Avalanche introduces custom Layer 1 blockchains with native interoperability: sovereign chains built for specific use cases, natively connected to the wider Avalanche network.

Avalanche Layer 1s allow institutions to embed compliance and KYC at the protocol level. Payment providers can optimize for performance, their most critical design constraint. Central banks can configure specially tailored monetary policy. And because of Avalanche Interchain Messaging (ICM), all these diverse Layer 1s can interoperate seamlessly with one another and thus with public permissionless DeFi applications as well.

The direction our world is heading is clear: stablecoins will soon surpass credit cards in settlement volume, CBDCs will launch on blockchain networks, and many institutions will choose to operate their products, markets, and rails on Avalanche Layer 1s.

Stablecoins and institutional adoption are the most powerful forces in crypto today and Avalanche is the infrastructure purposefully built to carry them into a future where global finance runs onchain.

- throw away every one of your socks and boxers. buy brand new, all the same color/style. your drawers will never look so good. 

- get a coach for whatever hobby you care about - sports, chess, art, language, it doesn't matter. just pay someone to shortcut your own learning time

- buy an in-home sauna if you have the space. it's  ~$3,000, the same as a high end TV, and if you use it everyday its absolutely worth it

- pay for a personal stylist to redo your wardrobe

- upgrade your zoom setup - nice camera, nice lights, nice microphone. this will boost your perceived credibility more than you think

- pay for your mom/dad/sibling to go on a fancy trip. pay for everything, including flights, hotels, food. it is the single thing that will make you feel like you made it, and the memory will last a lifetime.

- get an inroom IV drip when you travel and watch your jetlag disappear (s/o @calilyliu)

- pay for a 3 hour couple's massage. get the body scrub, it's better than you think.

- buy a package for facials and get one every ~6 weeks

- start getting haircuts every other week. nothing to make you feel fresh like a fresh cut. 

- only travel in nice cars. always get the expensive Uber/Grab/Careem. it will cost you ~$2k extra over the course of the year, but the feeling of luxury is worth much more (s/o @akshaybd)

- get a personal chef to come a few days a week and meal prep for you

- get an at-home massage every sunday

- if you're balding, get a red light hair mask. proven to work, and better to start sooner rather than later

- if you live near family/friends, pay a private chef to make a nice dinner for all of you once a month

- get a personal assistant for shopping, travel, and general research tasks. if you're in dubai or india, @dxbcare is quite good and affordable

- spend less time investing by giving your capital to professionals (liquid, venture, hedge funds, etc). make investing someone else's headache

- buy your wife/girlfriend/mother a new watch instead of buying one for yourself

- set aside a new wallet with a substantial amount of stables, yield farm on @jup_lend, and tell yourself that in 2 years you're going to give it to a family member

- buy a really nice mattress and desk chair and watch your back problems disappear

- send a gift (chocolates, cupcakes, etc) to your friends on their birthdays instead of just sending a text

They were saying the quiet part out loud. It was too hard, even in 2008, to know precisely what was going on in the economy with the tools and data The Fed had access to. 

In 2025, 17 years later, it is reasonable to ask two critical questions:

1. Does the free market, using SOFR, now have a better rate setting mechanism than Fed Governors via Fed Funds? SOFR is robust, calculated and secured. Fed Funds is human derived, unsecured and sits on top of data that changes wildly after the fact. It_ prime to inaccuracy, politics and partisanship, which we are seeing now. 

2. Is the Fed an effective Lender of Last Resort? It_ hard to say but the track record is spotty and there is ample evidence that Treasury has done this function better in the past. 

All of this is to say that as the global economy has become more robust, we need to improve the underlying infrastructure it uses to function properly. 

There are other important things that The Fed does and likely should continue to do, like banking oversight, but the most dynamic parts of monetary policy should be the least susceptible to politics and partisanship.

Take browsers and payment flows. 

Today, if you need _omething, you use a browser and search for it. You then go to that site, load up your cart and then check out, putting in your payment details. 

Tomorrow, you can just tell the AI what you roughly need. It will then go out, do all the hard work of comparison and search and deliver you an elegant summary of the results so you can click on everything you want. Then an agent will load up all of those carts on your behalf. It will also take your payment credentials and check out. But in the second step, xAI, OpenAI etc will just keep your payment details on file for you and simply write the transaction over stablecoins to the site in question.

In 2020-2021 I was obsessed with decentralization and immutability, the only true roadmap for that was Satoshi. The only way to let a protocol truly decentralize is for the founder to not be the visionary and to walk away. I achieved this by putting myself in a position I could walk away. No token allocation for myself. No money raised for the project. No built in fees or benefit for myself. No licenses, all given away for free.

With FT, I am raising, I have founder and team tokens, they are vested behind buybacks. I am not optimizing for decentralization, I am optimizing for building a killer product.

So many new unique crypto projects, all under one umbrella. What I previously built was entirely without personal incentives, imagine what I can do incentivized.

In 2020-2021 I was obsessed with decentralization and immutability, the only true roadmap for that was Satoshi. The only way to let a protocol truly decentralize is for the founder to not be the visionary and to walk away. I achieved this by putting myself in a position I could walk away. No token allocation for myself. No money raised for the project. No built in fees or benefit for myself. No licenses, all given away for free.

With FT, I am raising, I have founder and team tokens, they are vested behind buybacks. I am not optimizing for decentralization, I am optimizing for building a killer product.

So many new unique crypto projects, all under one umbrella. What I previously built was entirely without personal incentives, imagine what I can do incentivized.

2025-08-31,all,"In a world of useful AI chat bots and agents, the need and usefulness of many existing modalities will be challenged. 

Take browsers and payment flows. 

Today, if you need _omething, you use a browser and search for it. You then go to that site, load up your cart and then check out, putting in your payment details. 

Tomorrow, you can just tell the AI what you roughly need. It will then go out, do all the hard work of comparison and search and deliver you an elegant summary of the results so you can click on everything you want. Then an agent will load up all of those carts on your behalf. It will also take your payment credentials and check out. But in the second step, xAI, OpenAI etc will just keep your payment details on file for you and simply write the transaction over stablecoins to the site in question. 

My prediction here is that the AI Chatbot is becoming the front door of the internet much faster than we realize. It will subsume many existing behaviors.

2025-09-10,positive,"The $USDH debate is one of the more interesting events in recent crypto memory  a case where US policy (the GENIUS Act) is crucial to a major design decision.

I have no vote, but I do see some misunderstanding about GENIUS worth clarifying. A few points to consider for those evaluating the proposals:

1) There is no such thing as a ""GENIUS-compliant"" stablecoin today.

A lot of the debate has focused on whether the stablecoin proposals comply with GENIUS. But the bill itself doesn't actually provide the rules for how issuers can comply  it sets forth a general framework and leaves the details for regulators to fill in through rulemaking. A whole lot of rulemaking! And until that rulemaking is done, there is no way to evaluate if a stablecoin is compliant.

Rulemaking isn't a minor detail or mere delay  GENIUS literally doesn't become effective law until 120 days after the rules are finalized, which is supposed to happen by July 18, 2026. That set the expected effective date of GENIUS at November 15, 2026. Until then, stablecoins will continue to be regulated exactly as they were one, five, ten years ago.

Given this, what matters most is that $USDH complies with current law as it stands today. Sure, it's possible to get a jump start on GENIUS by obtaining licenses or charters sooner than later. But it's equally possible to waste time and resources on the wrong approach before rulemaking is done.

Stablecoin issuers should have plenty of time to get into compliance with GENIUS as the rules come together. Supporting or opposing $USDH proposals based on GENIUS compliance today  before we even know what GENIUS compliance means  seems like putting the cart before the horse.

2) State regulation offers little or no benefit for stablecoins with over $10b in total supply.

Some of the debate has focused on state charters and licensing as an advantage for GENIUS compliance. I don't see it.

One thing we know about GENIUS is that it will offer two pathways for stablecoin issuance  state and federal. The state pathway will work for smaller stablecoins that keep their total supply under $10b. The federal pathway will be mandatory for all stablecoins that get bigger than $10b.

If you're bullish on the Hyperliquid ecosystem, then you probably want to plan for $USDH to exceed $10b in total supply. This means the issuer will need to follow federal, not state, compliance requirements. To do so, issuers will have to be regulated as banks or obtain a federal charter from the OCC.

It's hard to see how state charters or licensing could help with the federal pathway. In fact, obtaining state charters or licenses may be a waste of time and resources, except to the extent necessary to comply with current law before GENIUS becomes effective. So the focus on state regulation seems misplaced.

3) Evaluating GENIUS compliance is a ""founder bet"" as much as a legal analysis.

As I've said a couple times, it is definitely important that $USDH comply with current law as it stands.

But since GENIUS isn't effective yet  and since we don't even know what the rules will be  the key question for evaluating $USDH proposals isn't ""is this team GENIUS-compliant right now?"" but rather ""is this team sophisticated and skilled enough to become GENIUS-compliant when the time comes?""

As @CampbellJAustin said today, ""Fun to see this @HyperliquidX thing waking everyone up to the fact that distribution is the key economic factor for stablecoins...."" In my humble opinion, what you want is a killer team that can follow the law today, prepare for the law tomorrow, and meanwhile crush the $USDH go-to-market with world-class execution.

Chamath:

_lex, what did you mean earlier when you said progressives want you to be poor? I may be paraphrasing.

Alex Karp:

_he modern progressive movement is clearly not progressive.

_rogressive is defined by the working class do better tomorrow than they did today and know it.

_o do that, you need things that you can do at scale now. Vocational training on AI-based systems, making our laborers more valuable. Obviously closing the border so that you don't reduce the amount that you pay people, and also eviscerate legal protections. This is not progressive.

_t's not progressive, by the way, to have so little competence or willing to use force that we get overrun by drugs.

_ho do those drugs go to? Disproportionately poor people of color.

_t's not progressive to have crime rates you know, to be a war zone, you have to have five deaths per 100,000. That's like half our cities. How is that progressive?

-Ethena is not a Hyperliquid native team
-We have other product lines outside of USDH
-Our ambitions extend beyond working with just one partner exchange

These are valid and we accept the pushback.

It appears the decision is a near certainty now and we will respectfully be withdrawing our proposal to allow validators to signal their support elsewhere if they want to.

Congratulations to the Native Markets team. You deserve this.

While some are complaining about their lack of credibility I think their success here perfectly embodies everything which is so special about Hyperliquid and their community.

No one gives a fuck how big you are, your background, pedigree or financial resources. It is a level playing field where emergent players can win the hearts of the community and are given a fair shot at succeeding.

Also worth calling out the other proposals which were a testament to the quality of teams now in this space and it is great to see us all elevate each other to a higher level.

2025-09-12,neutral,"How did we end up polling on Discord for Nepal_ next leader? Here_ a rundown:

tldr; Nepali government was overthrown in 48 hours and I think i just witnessed the first internet native revolution.

Over two decades ago, Nepali citizens overthrew the Monarchy to establish a multiparty democracy hoping for a better future. However, two decades later, the leaders of three major democratic parties, who overthrew the monarchy, were still fighting for power and greed. 

They went from no slippers on their feet to living in lavish mansions, but the common men were still poor, with no sign of improvements.

However, something changed from around late 2010s. People who relied on national TV and radio for their information started getting wide access to internet. People could see every mishaps these politicians made in real time, every frustrated candid stories of every Nepali citizens, and the rapid development of every other country that used to be on a similar level to Nepal. Frustration started accumulating rapidly among people, all enabled by the internet.

Fast forward to around August 2025, Nepali youths, frustrated by the corruption and incompetencies of the government, started a trend on TikTok called ""Nepo Babies"" where they created reels comparing the lavish lifestyle of politicians' kids with common citizens of Nepal who couldn't even afford a proper restaurant meal.

This exposé got widespread traction on TikTok and Instagram, which infuriated all the citizens of Nepal who had already lost hope from the current politicians. Everyone started cyberbullying their kids for their lifestyle.

Coincidentally, Nepali government imposed a ban on almost all major social media sites on September 4th 2025 saying they need to register their entities in Nepal and follow a strict content moderation rule imposed by the government, which obviously, these sites declined to.

The problem is over 20% population of Nepal resides outside the country and suddenly they had no proper way to communicate with their relatives back home. This lack of empathy, combined by the suspicious timing around the rise of nepo baby trend and a long standing disappointment in the current establishment was too much for everyone.

Suddenly, on September 5th, a call for a peaceful protest on September 8th started circulating on TikTok, Reddit, Discord, Instagram, etc.

What_ interesting is, this was a decentralized protest, all organized via internet without any central figure. Since it was organized collectively by youths on internet, this protest was given the title of _en-Z protest.
 
A huge 12,000+ mass appeared on September 8th protest. It started peaceful, but things suddenly got violent. The government gave an order to shoot which led to the death of 20+ people and 300+ injuries by end of the day. Gut wrenching pictures and videos from the protest started floating on internet which led to a widespread outrage against the police and the government.

Later that night, Government gave a very lackluster and apathetic response to such a devastating situation. With this, peace wasn_ an option anymore.

Reddit, Discord, and TikTok was filled with rage and call for revenge on September 9th. People started sharing tutorials on how to create a Molotov cocktail, how to disarm tear gas, etc. This felt like the heat of the moment, but no one expected what was about to come the next day.

Next day, everyone from every part of country started coming out of their houses and protesting against the government. Around early afternoon, news started circulating on internet that a big group was headed towards the house of the Prime Minister. Then another group headed towards another big politician, then another, then another. All of their houses were burnt.

Internet facilitated a realtime coordination for mimetic actions across the nation. This is why _urn their mansions became the trend for the day within a couple hours across the country. Police force, who were already demoralized from last day_ actions and reactions, showed little resistance on this day. 

Almost every major politician_ house was burnt, and many politicians were even beaten brutally by the crowd, on streets, on rivers, and in their mansions.

I was on Reddit and Discord all day. It truly felt like dropping at a warzone where everyone is coordinating attacks, sharing real time updates, and even telling which locations to avoid, etc. By late afternoon, the prime minister resigned and took refuge under the army alongside many other politicians. Army took control for security later that night and wanted to host negotiations with the protestors. 
 
The problem was, there was no representative for the protest. It was all a collective decentralized effort. So people started discussing and polling on Discord and Reddit on who should represent the protestors and who they should nominate as their future leader. 

It_ been a chaotic effort (who knew decentralization would be chaotic), but they_e finally agreed upon who they want to nominate. Discussion between Army, the President, and the protestors is still ongoing, but it_ almost guaranteed now that the leader nominated by the Discord polls will take the position within a couple days.
 
It was an unfortunate event where many things went wrong and the destruction pushed Nepal back by years, but the sequence of events were very unique, where almost everything originated and accumulated from the internet. The dissatisfaction accumulated for years on internet, and suddenly in two days, the government was overthrown, all coordinated via Internet with no central figure. In many ways, the protest happened on the internet for years, but the government didn_ listen.

1) Oracle entered their largest deals in its history with OpenAI and TikTok.

First, Oracle has locked in a $300 billion, five-year cloud infrastructure deal with OpenAI. This deal starts in 2027 as part of the previously announced Project Stargate data center building initiative.

Under this deal, Oracle is committing to build out massive compute capacity to support OpenAI_ rapidly scaling model development and deployment. ""We signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1,"" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz.

Critics do warn of an _I bubble as they point out that OpenAI_ current revenue base ($12.7B projected revenue in 2025, with $58B in total funding) is much smaller than the size of its future obligations under this deal.

This leaves Oracle's RPOs heavily concentrated with OpenAI, and delivering the required infrastructure at scale (especially power, cooling, energy, real estate) is a non-trivial task.

At the same time, Oracle is being woven into another high-stakes geopolitical and regulatory story: the proposed TikTok deal.

Under the framework agreement being discussed between the U.S. and China, Oracle, along with investors like Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz, would hold an 80% stake in TikTok U.S. operations, while ByteDance (TikTok_ Chinese parent) would retain a minority share (<20%), satisfying the divestment requirement in recent U.S. law.

Oracle is expected not only to serve as a principal investor but also to host and manage U.S. user data (via its cloud infrastructure) under the Project Texas environment as an additional security safeguard.",2025-09-20 17:18:00+00:00,44.0,45.0,540.0,762.0

This is a significant jump from its February 2024 Series B funding, which valued the company at $2.6 billion.

The raise cements Figure as one of the frontrunners in humanoid robotics along with Tesla_ Optimus, with capital earmarked for three priorities:

1. Scaling production and real-world deployment of humanoid robots via its BotQ manufacturing line, targeting both households and commercial operations

2. Building next-generation GPU infrastructure to accelerate training and simulation for its Helix AI platform, designed for embodied intelligence in perception, reasoning, and control

While benchmark revisions are a standard annual adjustment, this scale is unusually large.

The revision has shown that the labor market has been substantially weaker than monthly reports suggested, especially over the transition between administrations.

This emphasizes my concern that the government is lacking the tools to accurately read and forecast the necessary data to calibrate policy more cautiously.

Against this backdrop of labor market softness, the Federal Reserve on September 17 cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

This marks the first rate cut since December 2024 and moved the target range down to 4.00%-4.25%. The move was characterized as a _isk-management action by Jerome Powell, highlighting weakening job growth and rising unemployment risks, even while inflation remains elevated at around 2.9%.

During this time we can also see that spot gold hit a new all-time high near US$3,700/gl ounce (up 38.5% YTD), as Central Banks demand for gold across the world has increased due to inflation risk and geopolitical tensions.

There is a chance that current labor reports might be revised lower in the future, and we_e seen a downtrend in yields YTD for the 2 year, 5 year and even 10 year Treasuries, which can signal that market participants are pricing in further rate cuts and potentially even a recession.

We want more methodical, hi quality, well written, well documented and useful code that works in hard production environments.

If this is what you need, consider trying it. You can still sign up for the waitlist and then we will release the product in GA in November.

It needs a collaborative but highly structured, detailed, well documented and rigidly guardrailed system to build next gen software.

2025-09-27,positive,"3) In a milestone for neurology, uniQure_ experimental gene therapy, AMT-130, demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of disease progression in a Phase I/II clinical trial.

The trial suggested that high-dose patients had up to 75% slower decline than matched controls over three years, with improvements across clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Huntington_ disease is caused by a faulty huntingtin gene (HTT) that leads to the production of an abnormal, toxic protein which progressively damages brain cells.

The build up leads to symptoms showing up typically between 30 and 50 years old. 

The core idea behind AMT-130 is to reduce the amount of the huntingtin protein that cells produce.

If replicated in larger trials, this could shift Huntington_ treatment from symptom management to disease modification.

For biotech, it reinforces the momentum of gene therapies as a platform technology with potential to help cure ALS, Parkinson_, and other monogenic neurodegenerative diseases.

The intent is to curb abuses of the system and protect American workers by discouraging reliance on foreign technical labor.

In further steps to reform the H-1B program, the Department of Labor will revise and raise the prevailing wage levels in order to up-skill the program and ensure that it is used to hire only the best of the best temporary foreign workers.

Additionally the Department of Homeland Security will prioritize high-skilled, high-paid aliens in the H-1B lottery over those at lower wage levels and has the discretion to exempt individuals whose hiring is _n the national interest.

Back in 2023, three of the top 10 H-1B employers were either headquartered in India or originated in India and are now headquartered in the U.S. The median annual compensation for all approved H-1B beneficiaries is $120,000.

The new price tag will squeeze companies to focus on the higher end of the talent pool and give up space for other companies to have a higher chance of winning the lottery.

1) OpenAI and NVIDIA announced a strategic partnership to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems over the next several years, with NVIDIA committing up to $100 billion in phased investment.

Vera: NVIDIA_ first custom CPU, built to work in lockstep with the GPU

AI and Agents are extremely useful but cannot be trusted in high-value scenarios.

Excited to share Google, Coinbase, Worldcoin_ Humans vs AI, Dapper Labs, ElizaOS, OpenRank, Collective Memory, FereAI, and OpenFront are among the first exploring what verifiable agents make possible with EigenCloud.

_ Verifiable agents: logic provably runs as written. @humansvs_ai of @worldcoin proves fair gameplay with 70k weekly users.

_ Insured agents: economic guarantees against failure. @fere_ai agents run for months without guardrails.

_ Sovereign agents: unstoppable peers that act on their own behalf. ElizaOS + @coinbase AgentKit show how open-source and infra converge.

1. CASH is an open-loop, neutral, @solana-first stablecoin designed by Phantom using Open Issuance by @stablecoin and @Stripe. We designed CASH to maximize utility for both consumers and developers alike. It_ live now and developers can sign up to originate CASH and receive the rewards for the supply they generate at useCASH.xyz.

2. Phantom Cash is a new suite of money movement features that bring crypto closer to the center of peoples daily financial lives. Phantom Cash includes virtual accounts where you can self-custody stable money, deposit paychecks, pay IRL with virtual (or physical) debit cards, or send money P2P around the world. Thanks to infrastructure from Stripe and Bridge, it will include easy on- and off-ramps with instant bank funding, making crypto more accessible for everyone. Phantom Cash will start rolling out over the next few weeks and you can sign up for the waitlist today in-app or at phantom.com/cash.

Today we_e one step closer to showing a lot more people how powerful crypto can be when it_ safe, accessible and easy-to-use. I_ argue no one does this better than we do.

- connect your bank accounts

2025-10-04,positive,"What I read this week...

1) This was a big week for AI video generation with Meta launching Vibes on September 25 and OpenAI following five days later with Sora 2.

Meta moved first with Vibes, an AI video feed within the Meta AI app, built in partnership with MidJourney and Black Forest Labs. The app allows for native image to video generation with a restyle option and music addition. The app also links to Instagram by allowing remixes when you see a _ibes video on your feed.

The launch landed awkwardly with a wave of critics. The skepticism was focused on how the tool will be used to lock users into doom scrolling low quality content.

On September 30th, OpenAI unveiled Sora 2, a leap they defined as the _hatGPT for creativity moment. The new model adds greater control, physical realism, synchronized sound, and most notably, the ability to generate convincing cameos (synthetic appearances of recognizable people and characters).

Unlike earlier demos, Sora now comes with a consumer-facing app, positioning it less as a research preview and more as a creative tool and social app. 

Together, the two launches underscore the split in how AI video is entering mainstream use and the general pushback against addictive media.

Meta is testing a tool for synthetic content that can anchor a feed with immediate free access, while OpenAI is leaning towards cinematic-quality tools to build memetic bridges between people, but currently gated behind invite codes.",2025-10-04 18:22:00+00:00,28.0,7.0,159.0,257.0

2025-10-04,positive,"3) Last week, Prime Minister Keir Starmer moved to mandate a national digital ID by the end of this Parliament (targeting 2029).

The Parliament_ goal is to help combat illegal working and streamlining citizens access to vital government services. Government statistics note 10% of UK citizens never had passports while 93% have smartphones, suggesting digital ID could reduce identity fraud while increasing access to social benefits.

The backlash has been immediate with a Parliamentary petition against Digital ID cards reaching 2.7 million signatures within a couple days, the largest in UK history, with critics branding it a move toward a _heckpoint society.

The Government responded on October 2nd confirming its decision to move forward.

They stress it_ about proving status for work rather than carrying an ID on the street, but it arrives alongside enforcement for speech restrictions and online safety laws. This creates the sense of a coordinated tightening of both physical and digital freedoms.

The UK lacks an American-style First Amendment; instead, expression is balanced against _arm prevention under a litany of laws that criminalizes offensive hate-speech.

In practice, that has meant ~12,000 arrests per year for speech-related offenses, or 30 per day.

London_ police chief has even threatened Elon Musk and U.S. users with prosecution for comments on British protests, illustrating how the UK is willing to extend jurisdiction globally.

Taken together, the BritCard rollout, stacking hate speech laws, and aggressive policing overlap is why critics talk about a _heckpoint society: credentials to work offline and warnings to watch what they say online.",2025-10-04 18:22:00+00:00,5.0,5.0,63.0,88.0
2025-10-04,negative,"2) At 12:01 AM on October 1, the U.S. federal government officially shut down as a result of neither Republican or Democratic funding bills reaching the necessary 60 votes in the Senate.

Unlike typical budget disputes, the fight is over healthcare policy.

Democrats are demanding an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, emphasizing that without them, premiums could spike, and cause millions to lose coverage in the coming years.

Republicans counter that the enhanced credits were created under Biden during Covid-19 as a temporary measure, and extending them now would lock in hundreds of billions in spending. They insist on a _lean funding bill through Nov. 21 first, leaving healthcare negotiations for later.

Democrats argue that tying the subsidies to the funding bill is their only real leverage, since Open Enrollment starts in November, which would send out increased premiums and make another shutdown near the holidays politically untenable.

The shutdown arrives amid a slowing labor market, rising inflation, and a Fed trying to navigate a rate-cut cycle. With Labor Department furloughs, the September jobs report is delayed, which means the Fed is flying blind ahead of its October meeting.

The CBO estimates roughly 750,000 federal workers are furloughed while essential workers (Social Security, Medicare, military ops, border security, TSA, USPS, etc) continue without pay, stacking missing compensation to ~$400M per day.

The Office of Management and Budget ordered agencies to prepare _eduction in Force plans, a move that goes beyond temporary furloughs and sets layoffs at agencies that ran out of funding and are inconsistent with the administration_ priorities.",2025-10-04 18:22:00+00:00,3.0,0.0,18.0,27.0

We_e proud to announce that $ICE, the owner of @NYSE and the largest exchange company in the world, is making a strategic investment of $2 billion into Polymarket, valuing us at $9 billion post-money.

Our partnership with ICE marks a major step in bringing prediction markets into the financial mainstream. But in addition to that, it_ a monumental step forward for DeFi. ICE is the one remaining founder-led exchange company, and Jeff is all-in on utilizing his assets, including NYSE, to usher in a new financial era of tokenization. We_e humbled to be working together on this endeavor. ICE will also begin distributing Polymarket data to thousands of financial institutions around the world. There is so much to build when you combine the force of ICE_ institutional scale and credibility with Polymarket_ consumer + cultural savvy and distribution. 

The past two years have been surreal. Going from a write off to creating a category, watching our vision become a reality. The Polymarket origin story is funny because it's a rare case of the dream being identical to how things played out. If I learned one thing, it_ that bold ideas are everywhere, hidden in plain sight. It just takes someone crazy enough to spend their life willing it into existence. That_ entrepreneurship: willing things into existence.

I remember reading Robin Hanson_ literature on prediction markets and thinking - man, this is too good of an idea to just exist in whitepapers. There were a million reasons why it shouldn_ work, countless arguments of why not to do it, and the odds were against us, but we had to try. 

At the onset of the pandemic, I quite literally had nothing to lose: 21, running out of money, 2.5 years since I dropped out and nothing to show for it. But I knew we were entering an era where ways to find truth would matter more than ever, and Polymarket could play a critical role in that. After all, nothing is more valuable than the truth. It_ still a work in progress, but we_e honored to have made the impact we have thus far.

I_ also like to give a special thank you to all of our users, builders, and community members who have been with us since 2020. Your support will not be forgotten _

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful for all of the support and hard work of my brilliant team. I_ getting to live my wildest dreams, seemingly against all odds, and I don_ take it for granted.

@RaghuRaghuram 

Nearly 30 years ago, I hired Raghu Raghuram to be a product manager at Netscape. While I do not remember much from those days, I keenly remember how smart he was. He was also eager to learn absolutely everything. The problem for me was that he was so smart that I did not have much to teach him about the products or technology, so I narrowed our conversations to leadership. As with everything else, he was eager to learn and quickly became the top product manager in the organization. I had a glimpse, but I honestly had no idea what a great leader he would become. 

I watched from afar as he took over product leadership at VMware. That was quite a feat as the company was founded by my friend Diane Greene, who held her product people to the highest standard in the industry. Naturally, he went on to become Chief Executive Officer where he grew VMware into a platform company with over $13B in revenue and more than 300K customers in 60+ countries; shepherded industry-disrupting acquisitions such as Nicira; and deftly and uniquely steered VMware from on-premise to multi-cloud technology. As a result, he became known as the greatest infrastructure strategist in the game. Ultimately, he led the company through challenging times to the largest software exit ever in the sale to Broadcom.  

He is an amazing strategist and leader, and I am proud of my small association with him.

That is why I am thrilled to announce that Raghu has joined Andreessen Horowitz to push us forward in 3 important areas with 3 significant roles:

A General Partner on our AI Infra team where his incredible infrastructure expertise will serve us well.
A General Partner on our Growth team where his comprehensive understanding of how to go to market, scale organizations, globalize, and navigate industry changes will be a huge boost for our growth companies.
A Managing Partner and my consigliere who will help me run the firm  I could not be more excited to have a partner whose management and leadership skills exceed my own in many areas.

2025-10-10,positive,"Today we are announcing that a16z is co-leading the Series D in @Kalshi, a regulated exchange for trading on prediction markets. Prediction markets are a modern implementation of a classic economic idea, one most clearly articulated by Friedrich Hayek.

Hayek and the knowledge problem

Hayek argued that no central planner could ever access the dispersed knowledge held by millions of people across an economy, a fundamental challenge that has come to be known as the _nowledge problem. Much of this knowledge is tacit and unspoken, embedded in people_ experiences, circumstances, and preferences.

Hayek wasn_ just pointing out the limits of central planning. He was offering a solution. In his 1945 essay The Use of Knowledge in Society, Hayek argued that the solution lies in looking outward, not inward: _e need decentralization, as he put it.

Markets, in Hayek_ view, are not just allocation mechanisms but information systems. Prices act as signals, compressing vast amounts of local knowledge into actionable information. Moreover, prices create incentives: they encourage people to make decisions and act in ways that drive information back into the system. This creates an iterative feedback loop, an engine that drives better performance.

Today we might say that the answer to the knowledge problem is not to give central planners more sophisticated computers. The answer is that markets themselves are the computers. Prediction markets make this idea concrete, applying it to questions about the future and turning collective knowledge into prices that reflect probabilities.

Why we_e investing in Kalshi

This is why we_e excited about prediction markets, and why we_e investing in Kalshi. Kalshi is bringing prediction markets into the mainstream with a compliant, scalable platform for event contracts covering everything from elections and economics to sports and culture. It has already seen billions in trading volume and continues to grow quickly. Kalshi also plans deep crypto integrations, work we_e excited to collaborate on, and today announced they_e expanding globally to 140 countries.

We_e not the only ones excited about the potential of prediction markets. For businesses and investors, event contracts can hedge risk, such as exposure to economic or policy changes. For policymakers and analysts, market prices offer real-time forecasts that can outperform polls and expert predictions. And for society at large, prediction markets create an open, transparent, and incentive-driven way to aggregate beliefs about the future.

This is the right moment for prediction markets. As trust in established institutions reaches historic lows  at least according to the polls  we need new systems that can earn trust in different ways. We believe the answer lies in open, decentralized systems. DeFi provides an alternative to traditional finance, stablecoins to conventional payment providers, and prediction markets to expert forecasts. Where people once trusted banks or pundits, they can now trust protocols and markets.

Hayek_ insight was that knowledge is too widely distributed for any one authority to possess. Instead, we need systems that harness the intelligence of the many. Kalshi puts this idea into action, transforming dispersed information into concrete, market-based forecasts. We_e excited to support their work as they bring prediction markets into the mainstream.",2025-10-10 13:54:00+00:00,116.0,86.0,1093.0,1613.0

2025-10-11,neutral,"TLDR: During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt. This was Hyperliquid_ first cross-margin ADL in more than 2 years of operation. ADL does not change the outcome for any liquidated users. While some specific ADL providing trades were unfavorable, the aggregate effect of ADL was that traders realized significant pnl by closing positions at favorable prices that were only briefly available. 

--

It_ sad to see some people attack Hyperliquid to deflect from their own platforms issues. Solvency and uptime are the two most important properties of a financial system. These are table stakes for any trading system, and gaslighting to convince users otherwise is unethical and irresponsible.

Below is more analysis on how Hyperliquid_ margining system handled the extreme volatility.

Background on liquidations

For a perps system to be solvent, every position must be backed by a minimum amount of collateral. This is called the _aintenance margin. When positions do not meet the maintenance margin requirement, they are taken over by the system to be liquidated. Earlier today, many altcoins dropped by more than 50% in a short period of time. When this happens, long positions at 2x or higher leverage must be liquidated, or else the system accrues bad debt.

There were billions of dollars worth of positions liquidated on Hyperliquid in a matter of minutes. In a permissionless system, each user chooses their own position sizing and collateralization. Any system that does not liquidate the necessary users is irresponsibly gambling with other users funds. On Hyperliquid, every order, trade, and liquidation is transparently verifiable onchain. Many other venues significantly under-report liquidation data. This cannot be compared apples-to-apples against the fully onchain picture of Hyperliquid.

Background on HLP

HLP is a protocol vault with permissionless deposits that 1) provides order book liquidity and 2) performs backstop liquidations. The first role is negligible, with HLP trading less than 1% market share. The focus of this post is liquidations.

Liquidations are first attempted against the order book, and any user can provide liquidity to these market liquidations. Backstop liquidations occur when the order book does not have enough liquidity to absorb an undercollateralized position. In this case, HLP takes over the position along with its collateral. For improved risk management, HLP is split into several child vaults, and each liquidation is only sent to one child vault.

Background on ADL

Auto-deleveraging (ADL) is the liquidation mechanism of last resort, when market and backstop liquidations do not work. See Doug_ thread (link in reply) for a thorough explanation on the details of ADL.

Every ADL event has two sides: the _riggered side is undercollateralized, while the _roviding side is decided as a function of profitability and leverage used.

Similar to backstop liquidations, even though providers to ADL are profitable on average, there are no guarantees for any specific event. Some ADL providing trades were unfavorable, such as when only some components of long/short portfolio were closed. The system is designed to minimize ADLs because they are unpredictable even if ADL providing trades are profitable on average. Because HLP is a non-toxic backstop liquidator, ADL is a rare settlement of last resort. As far as I know, this was the first cross-margin ADL event on Hyperliquid mainnet (ADL is more common for isolated-only assets such as hyperps, which are not backstop liquidated by HLP).

Summary of events

Over the course of 20 minutes, HLP backstop liquidated billions of dollars worth of positions.

HLP's philosophy has always been to provide liquidity of last resort. Contrary to misconceptions, HLP is a non-toxic liquidator that does not pick profitable liquidations. Instead HLP is a public good for maintaining system solvency. In particular, Hyperliquid has no liquidation fees. HLP_ design, including its multi-component child vault system, is the product of countless simulations, and allows HLP to maximally serve the benefit of the protocol while managing its own risk.

In fact, the liquidator child vaults of HLP themselves became undercollateralized in the course of backstop liquidating as many user positions as possible. This is by design, where child vaults are isolated from the other components of the overall strategy. HLP is treated no differently from other users when participating in ADL. In aggregate, HLP's child vaults were the largest addresses on the triggered side of ADL by more than an order of magnitude. The addresses on the providing side of ADL against HLP_ child vaults realized hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profit relative to the prices shortly before and after the dislocation.

On other venues, the liquidation engine is not transparent and therefore may not be subject to the same strict margin requirements as for normal users. On these venues, the exchange could have backstop liquidated more positions, bearing increased solvency risk to extract hundreds of millions in business revenue. This is not an acceptable tradeoff for Hyperliquid.

Finally, I know that this is a difficult time for many traders, and I hope the community can continue to support each other and grow together. As a contributor to Hyperliquid, I_l continue to work my hardest to build the best possible platform that can house all of finance. Times like this highlight the importance of transparency and fairness in the financial system.",2025-10-11 17:40:00+00:00,838.0,1075.0,5463.0,10127.0

When this happens, long positions at 2x or higher leverage must be liquidated, or else the system accrues bad debt.

There were billions of dollars worth of positions liquidated on Hyperliquid in a matter of minutes. In a permissionless system, each user chooses their own position sizing and collateralization. Any system that does not liquidate the necessary users is irresponsibly gambling with other users funds. On Hyperliquid, every order, trade, and liquidation is transparently verifiable onchain. Many other venues significantly under-report liquidation data. This cannot be compared apples-to-apples against the fully onchain picture of Hyperliquid.

Background on HLP

HLP is a protocol vault with permissionless deposits that 1) provides order book liquidity and 2) performs backstop liquidations. The first role is negligible, with HLP trading less than 1% market share. The focus of this post is liquidations.

Liquidations are first attempted against the order book, and any user can provide liquidity to these market liquidations. Backstop liquidations occur when the order book does not have enough liquidity to absorb an undercollateralized position. In this case, HLP takes over the position along with its collateral. For improved risk management, HLP is split into several child vaults, and each liquidation is only sent to one child vault.

Background on ADL

Auto-deleveraging (ADL) is the liquidation mechanism of last resort, when market and backstop liquidations do not work. See Doug_ thread (link in reply) for a thorough explanation on the details of ADL.

Every ADL event has two sides: the _riggered side is undercollateralized, while the _roviding side is decided as a function of profitability and leverage used.

Similar to backstop liquidations, even though providers to ADL are profitable on average, there are no guarantees for any specific event. Some ADL providing trades were unfavorable, such as when only some components of long/short portfolio were closed. The system is designed to minimize ADLs because they are unpredictable even if ADL providing trades are profitable on average. Because HLP is a non-toxic backstop liquidator, ADL is a rare settlement of last resort. As far as I know, this was the first cross-margin ADL event on Hyperliquid mainnet (ADL is more common for isolated-only assets such as hyperps, which are not backstop liquidated by HLP).

Summary of events

Over the course of 20 minutes, HLP backstop liquidated billions of dollars worth of positions.

HLP's philosophy has always been to provide liquidity of last resort. Contrary to misconceptions, HLP is a non-toxic liquidator that does not pick profitable liquidations. Instead HLP is a public good for maintaining system solvency. In particular, Hyperliquid has no liquidation fees. HLP_ design, including its multi-component child vault system, is the product of countless simulations, and allows HLP to maximally serve the benefit of the protocol while managing its own risk.

In fact, the liquidator child vaults of HLP themselves became undercollateralized in the course of backstop liquidating as many user positions as possible. This is by design, where child vaults are isolated from the other components of the overall strategy. HLP is treated no differently from other users when participating in ADL. In aggregate, HLP's child vaults were the largest addresses on the triggered side of ADL by more than an order of magnitude. The addresses on the providing side of ADL against HLP_ child vaults realized hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profit relative to the prices shortly before and after the dislocation.

On other venues, the liquidation engine is not transparent and therefore may not be subject to the same strict margin requirements as for normal users. On these venues, the exchange could have backstop liquidated more positions, bearing increased solvency risk to extract hundreds of millions in business revenue. This is not an acceptable tradeoff for Hyperliquid.

Finally, I know that this is a difficult time for many traders, and I hope the community can continue to support each other and grow together. As a contributor to Hyperliquid, I_l continue to work my hardest to build the best possible platform that can house all of finance.

2025-10-12,neutral,"The Oct 11 Crypto Crash  What Really Happened

TL;DR:

Roughly $6090M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance_ own order-book data instead of external oracles.

That localized depeg triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations, cascaded into $19B+ globally, and earned the attackers about $192M via $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts opened on Hyperliquid hours earlier, but minutes before Trump tariff announcement.

It wasn_ a USDe failure!! It was Binance_ design flaw, timed with macro panic (Trump_ tariffs) for cover.

What looked like chaos was actually a coordinated exploitation of Binance_ internal pricing system, amplified by a macro shock and systemic leverage.

1�__ The Setup

Binance_ Unified Account let traders use assets like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL as collateral.

Instead of oracle or redemption prices, Binance valued these using its own spot market - a major vulnerability.

On Oct 6, Binance announced a fix to move to oracle-based pricing, but rollout wasn_ until Oct 14, leaving an 8-day window.

2�__ The Exploit

During that window, sophisticated actors manipulated Binance_ order books, dumping ~$6090M of USDe, driving it to $0.65 on Binance only (still ~$1 elsewhere).

Because the Unified Account marked collateral to internal prices, this instantly wiped margin value and triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations.

Then, Trump_ 100% China tariff headline hit, magnifying panic and liquidity stress.

3�__ The Profit Engine

The same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts, funded by $110M USDC from Arbitrum-linked sources.

As the Binance cascade unfolded, BTC and ETH cratered, those shorts netted $192M in profit before closing out at the bottom.

Timing, precision, and funding paths all suggest coordination.

4�__ The Contagion

Binance liquidations dumped BTC/ETH/ALTs into thin books.

Other exchanges mirrored the collapse through cross-market bots.

Market makers hedged across venues were forced to unwind everywhere.

Result: $19B+ global liquidations, with many alts down 5070% intraday, all triggered by <$100M of manipulated collateral.

5�__ Who_ at fault?

Binance: design flaw + delay in oracle rollout = root cause.

Exploiters: executed and timed the manipulation, profited via external shorts.

Ethena (USDe): not at fault - protocol stayed 1:1 collateralized, redemptions normal, peg held everywhere else.

6�__ Aftermath

Binance admitted _latform-related issues, promised compensation for affected margin/futures/loan users, and rolled out minimum price floors + oracle integration.

USDe remained operational, and the incident is now a case study in how exchange-side pricing errors can trigger system-wide liquidations.

Bottom line:
A ~$90M dump on Binance and a $1.1B leveraged short elsewhere sparked a $19B bloodbath.

Not a stablecoin failure, but a masterclass in exploiting flawed collateral valuation during peak macro stress.",2025-10-12 11:47:00+00:00,684.0,2162.0,8890.0,15266.0

I_e seen a lot of chatter about the Ethena depeg during the market mayhem this weekend. The story is that USDe briefly depegged to ~68c before recovering. Here_ the Binance chart everyone is quoting:

But digging into the data and talking to a bunch of folks over last couple days, it's now clear this story is not correct. USDe did *not* depeg.

First thing to understand about USDe: its most liquid venue is actually not on exchanges, it_ on Curve. There_ hundreds of millions of dollars of standing liquidity on Curve, while only tens of millions on any given exchange, including Binance.

So if you just look at that chart of USDe on Binance, it looks like USDe depegged. But if you superimpose the other liquid venues for USDe, you get a different picture:

We see here that while USDe wicked down on every CEX, it did not do so uniformly. Bybit briefly hit $0.95 then quickly recovered, yet Binance depegged a crazy amount and took forever to regain the peg. Curve meanwhile dipped a mere 0.3%. What explains this difference?

Remember, every single exchange was under immense load on that day_t was the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. Binance was extremely unstable during this period, causing MMs to be unable to shift inventory because APIs were failing and withdrawals and deposits were bricked. Nobody was able to step in and arb.

It_ like a fire broke out on Binance, but all of the roads were blocked and firefighters couldn_ make their way in. This caused a wildfire to break out on Binance, but pretty much everywhere else, that fire was immediately put out by bridging liquidity. (As Guy shows in his post, USDC also depegged a few cents temporarily on Binance due to the same general instability issues_iquidity just couldn_ get ferried in, but this wasn_ a depeg event for USDC either.)

So OK. Unsurprising that while there_ API instability, prices on exchanges are wildly different because nobody can get inventory in. But why did it decline so much deeper on Binance than on Bybit?

The answer is twofold_irst, Binance did not have any primary dealer relationship with Ethena to be able to directly mint and redeem on-platform (Bybit and other exchanges have this integrated) which allows MMs to stay on-platform and still perform peg arbitrage. This is huge, as otherwise an MM has to take their money *out* of Binance, go do the Ethena peg arb, and then bring back their inventory. Nobody was doing that in a moment of crisis when APIs were failing (plus so many other coins were cratering).

Second, Binance had their oracle poorly implemented and started liquidating positions they shouldn_ have_ood liquidation mechanisms don_ trigger on flash crashes. If you are not the primary venue for an asset (which Binance is not for USDe) then you should look at the price on the primary venue. If you are only looking at your own order book, you will liquidate too aggressively. This caused Binance to start liquidating USDe as though it was worth $0.80 or whatever, which caused a cascade. This is a big part of the reason why Binance is refunding people who were liquidated on USDe (other exchanges AFAIK are not doing so)_hey messed up by only looking at their own price instead of the true external price.

So this was a Binance-specific flash crash, which better market structure could_e prevented. USDe on its primary venue, Curve, was actually trading at a tight peg the entire day. This is really different from what you_ describe as a depeg.

If you remember USDC in 2023 during the banking crisis, this is what an actual depeg looks like:

During the banking crisis, USDC traded down on every single venue. There was *no* place where you could buy USDC for $1. Redemptions were literally halted, so $0.87 was the *true* price. That_ what a depeg means.

This instead was a Binance-specific dislocation. It_ a big lesson for market infra, but critical to understand the nuance here if you are trying to draw inferences about USDe_ mechanism from this weekend.

USDe was fully collateralized and worth $1 on its primary venue through the entire episode and actually increased its backing collateral over the weekend due to the price action. That said, this kind of market instability is ultimately good because it exposes lessons for the whole industry. Guy_ post below lays out how any exchange, including Binance, can avoid this kind of issue in the future.

2025-10-12,all,"The Oct 11 Crypto Crash  What Really Happened

TL;DR:

Roughly $6090M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance_ own order-book data instead of external oracles.

That localized depeg triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations, cascaded into $19B+ globally, and earned the attackers about $192M via $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts opened on Hyperliquid hours earlier, but minutes before Trump tariff announcement.

It wasn_ a USDe failure!! It was Binance_ design flaw, timed with macro panic (Trump_ tariffs) for cover.

What looked like chaos was actually a coordinated exploitation of Binance_ internal pricing system, amplified by a macro shock and systemic leverage.

1�__ The Setup

Binance_ Unified Account let traders use assets like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL as collateral.

Instead of oracle or redemption prices, Binance valued these using its own spot market - a major vulnerability.

On Oct 6, Binance announced a fix to move to oracle-based pricing, but rollout wasn_ until Oct 14, leaving an 8-day window.

2�__ The Exploit

During that window, sophisticated actors manipulated Binance_ order books, dumping ~$6090M of USDe, driving it to $0.65 on Binance only (still ~$1 elsewhere).

Because the Unified Account marked collateral to internal prices, this instantly wiped margin value and triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations.

Then, Trump_ 100% China tariff headline hit, magnifying panic and liquidity stress.

3�__ The Profit Engine

The same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts, funded by $110M USDC from Arbitrum-linked sources.

As the Binance cascade unfolded, BTC and ETH cratered, those shorts netted $192M in profit before closing out at the bottom.

Timing, precision, and funding paths all suggest coordination.

4�__ The Contagion

Binance liquidations dumped BTC/ETH/ALTs into thin books.

Other exchanges mirrored the collapse through cross-market bots.

Market makers hedged across venues were forced to unwind everywhere.

Result: $19B+ global liquidations, with many alts down 5070% intraday, all triggered by <$100M of manipulated collateral.

5�__ Who_ at fault?

Binance: design flaw + delay in oracle rollout = root cause.

Exploiters: executed and timed the manipulation, profited via external shorts.

Ethena (USDe): not at fault - protocol stayed 1:1 collateralized, redemptions normal, peg held everywhere else.

6�__ Aftermath

Binance admitted _latform-related issues, promised compensation for affected margin/futures/loan users, and rolled out minimum price floors + oracle integration.

USDe remained operational, and the incident is now a case study in how exchange-side pricing errors can trigger system-wide liquidations.

Bottom line:
A ~$90M dump on Binance and a $1.1B leveraged short elsewhere sparked a $19B bloodbath.

Not a stablecoin failure, but a masterclass in exploiting flawed collateral valuation during peak macro stress.",2025-10-12 11:47:00+00:00,684.0,2162.0,8890.0,15266.0

2025-10-12,all,"Did Ethena Really Depeg?

I_e seen a lot of chatter about the Ethena depeg during the market mayhem this weekend. The story is that USDe briefly depegged to ~68c before recovering. Here_ the Binance chart everyone is quoting:

But digging into the data and talking to a bunch of folks over last couple days, it's now clear this story is not correct. USDe did *not* depeg.

First thing to understand about USDe: its most liquid venue is actually not on exchanges, it_ on Curve. There_ hundreds of millions of dollars of standing liquidity on Curve, while only tens of millions on any given exchange, including Binance.

So if you just look at that chart of USDe on Binance, it looks like USDe depegged. But if you superimpose the other liquid venues for USDe, you get a different picture:

We see here that while USDe wicked down on every CEX, it did not do so uniformly. Bybit briefly hit $0.95 then quickly recovered, yet Binance depegged a crazy amount and took forever to regain the peg. Curve meanwhile dipped a mere 0.3%. What explains this difference?

Remember, every single exchange was under immense load on that day_t was the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. Binance was extremely unstable during this period, causing MMs to be unable to shift inventory because APIs were failing and withdrawals and deposits were bricked. Nobody was able to step in and arb.

It_ like a fire broke out on Binance, but all of the roads were blocked and firefighters couldn_ make their way in. This caused a wildfire to break out on Binance, but pretty much everywhere else, that fire was immediately put out by bridging liquidity. (As Guy shows in his post, USDC also depegged a few cents temporarily on Binance due to the same general instability issues_iquidity just couldn_ get ferried in, but this wasn_ a depeg event for USDC either.)

So OK. Unsurprising that while there_ API instability, prices on exchanges are wildly different because nobody can get inventory in. But why did it decline so much deeper on Binance than on Bybit?

The answer is twofold_irst, Binance did not have any primary dealer relationship with Ethena to be able to directly mint and redeem on-platform (Bybit and other exchanges have this integrated) which allows MMs to stay on-platform and still perform peg arbitrage. This is huge, as otherwise an MM has to take their money *out* of Binance, go do the Ethena peg arb, and then bring back their inventory. Nobody was doing that in a moment of crisis when APIs were failing (plus so many other coins were cratering).

Second, Binance had their oracle poorly implemented and started liquidating positions they shouldn_ have_ood liquidation mechanisms don_ trigger on flash crashes. If you are not the primary venue for an asset (which Binance is not for USDe) then you should look at the price on the primary venue. If you are only looking at your own order book, you will liquidate too aggressively. This caused Binance to start liquidating USDe as though it was worth $0.80 or whatever, which caused a cascade. This is a big part of the reason why Binance is refunding people who were liquidated on USDe (other exchanges AFAIK are not doing so)_hey messed up by only looking at their own price instead of the true external price.

So this was a Binance-specific flash crash, which better market structure could_e prevented. USDe on its primary venue, Curve, was actually trading at a tight peg the entire day. This is really different from what you_ describe as a depeg.

If you remember USDC in 2023 during the banking crisis, this is what an actual depeg looks like:

During the banking crisis, USDC traded down on every single venue. There was *no* place where you could buy USDC for $1. Redemptions were literally halted, so $0.87 was the *true* price. That_ what a depeg means.

This instead was a Binance-specific dislocation. It_ a big lesson for market infra, but critical to understand the nuance here if you are trying to draw inferences about USDe_ mechanism from this weekend.

USDe was fully collateralized and worth $1 on its primary venue through the entire episode and actually increased its backing collateral over the weekend due to the price action. That said, this kind of market instability is ultimately good because it exposes lessons for the whole industry. Guy_ post below lays out how any exchange, including Binance, can avoid this kind of issue in the future.

TL;DR: USDe did not depeg, Binance did.",2025-10-12 13:45:00+00:00,203.0,268.0,1455.0,2600.0

2025-10-14,negative,"This is so highly misleading by only focusing on the ADL on the largest coins, which suffered from far less price discolation and ADL overall than other coins

If you are running a long / short book as I was, you are long these assets below, not short them 

This also looks at ADL in a vacuum, and without regard to anything else in an account 

Your larger shorts are going to be in the other top 50 alts that are dog shit imo (ATOM, STX, APT, FET) - those shorts closed much earlier and blew you out leaving with only longs to liquidate your account  

There are so many other places where the @HyperliquidX platform is broken for perps (no ADL transparency / queue, no flash crash protection, one touch price oracles for liquidation (non time based), no whale risk blocker, and zero insurance fund is laughable for someone at $hype scale 

So please get this propaganda off my timeline, it is insulting. I can assure you @HyperliquidX did not perform well for anyone running a larger profitable  long / short book, or even any sort of mild leverage on just longs.  I cannot recommend to anyone serious or an instó to trade on hype when they don't even acknowledge these issues. 

In fact, between @DriftProtocol and @dYdX where I run very similar books, only @HyperliquidX blew me out.

If the data below is accurate, then we should expect that more local communities will pushback to stop data center buildouts in their region if it spikes electricity prices so much.

A solution, however, is for these hyperscalers to use their robust free cashflow to go into local areas and pay for solar+storage or pay for the electricity for every resident.

1) On Monday, JPMorgan Chase announced a sweeping plan to deploy $1.5 trillion in financing over the next decade toward what it calls _ecurity and resiliency. 

The categories are a blend of industrial strategy, national defense, and infrastructure modernization.

_t has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing  all of which are essential for our national security

It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock, and an education system not aligned to the skills we need. - Jamie Dimon.

JPMorganChase plans to focus on the following four key areas:

1. Supply Chain and Advanced Manufacturing: Critical minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics

2. Defense and Aerospace: Defense technology, autonomous systems, drones, next-gen connectivity and secure communications

3. Energy Independence and Resilience: Battery storage, grid resilience and distributed energy

4. Frontier and Strategic Technologies: AI, cybersecurity and quantum computing

Dimon concluded, _opefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges. We need to act now.

2) The Dutch government_ decision to seize control of Nexperia, a semiconductor firm owned by China_ Wingtech, marks a watershed moment in Europe_ industrial policy.

The official reason was _ecent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia under former CEO Zhang Xuezheng. This move hopes to safeguard crucial technological knowledge and capabilities that could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.

This intervention is rippling through the European corporate supply chain as China continues to tighten rare earth exports while the U.S. responds with further tariffs.

3) Google DeepMind_ latest research marks a profound turning point for AI. On Wednesday, Sundar Pichai announced that their model generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior that was validated by scientists in living cells.

The task they gave was for the model to find a drug that acts as a conditional amplifier. 

The model generated an unexpected insight into how tumors evade immune detection by suggesting a way to transform _old (invisible to the body_ immune system) tumors, which resisted treatment, into _ot ones that respond to immunotherapy.

The hypothesis was then tested in the lab and remarkably resulted in a roughly 50% increase in antigen presentation, which would make the tumor more visible to the immune system.

_e can finally begin to simulate how real human cells behave_n context, in silico. This is where AI stops being just an analysis tool and starts becoming a model system for biology itself. - David van Dijk, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Yale

If results continue to hold, this represents one of the first instances where an AI system not only mapped biological correlations but helped discover new biology.

DeepMind also just announced a new partnership with fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, using AI models to accelerate plasma simulation and reactor optimization. If they succeed this will make SPARC the first magnetic fusion machine in history to generate net fusion energy.",2025-10-18 17:52:00+00:00,35.0,49.0,533.0,736.0

Let me be clear about what I_ doing: my goal is to build the world_ next major moral framework. An ideology that bridges human and machine, biology and intelligence, the ancient and the emergent.

The coming psychosis
A real possibility in the coming years is that society becomes dangerously psychotic. Yes, we are already psychotic. Addicted, fragmented and self-destructive._ But I mean clinically psychotic and on a civilizational scale.

We are already showing precursor symptoms: record antidepressant use, rising suicide rates, rampant addiction, and global increases in loneliness and anxiety disorders. These are all biomarkers of a species whose cognitive environment has outpaced its biology.

Human cognition evolved under conditions of slow change. Our nervous systems and social architectures were shaped for a world that changed near imperceptibly over millennia. 

When things change faster than our native capacity, we lose coherence. The hippocampus binds the present to memory, and the prefrontal cortex constructs a coherent future.

When environments change too rapidly, when the map no longer matches the territory, the brain destabilizes._ This can trigger a cognitive dissonance cascade, where our core beliefs are invalidated so rapidly that we lose narrative coherence. When feedback loops in an organism can_ stabilize, the system oscillates until it breaks._ Civilization is entering that oscillatory phase.

At a collective level, this is the recipe for mass psychosis.

Historians call it cultural disintegration and psychologists call it dissociation. It means the same thing: when the story breaks, the organism panics.

The fragility of society
Our stability, both personal and collective, is built on identity, work, purpose, rule of law, religions, and social cohesion. These are shared fictions that create coherence for billions of us to manage the chaos of our existence.

AI is about to accelerate discontinuity beyond what our psyches can handle. For example: 

1) Erosion of human agency: the threat is not just that AI will make us less ""useful."" It's that it will erode our sense of agency. Our belief that we are the causal authors of our lives. When AI can create, reason, and strategize more effectively than we can, our role shifts from actor to audience. This is the core of the looming global occupational identity crisis.  Not just the loss of income, but the loss of purpose that comes when our work no longer feels essential.

2) Weakening of rule of law: autonomous agents will operate at speeds that make our legal systems seem geological in pace. Law will lag reality.

3) Hollowing out religions: faith has offered transcendence. AI may offer a more potent, personalized, and high res simulation of it. On demand.

Stability to resilience
Last week I wrote about how humans use moral frameworks to stabilize their reality. If you can_ win on position or strength, win on virtue. A moral inversion. It_ a human superpower to take a disadvantaged situation and turn it into a strength.

Society is currently built on stability and predictability, which has now become a liability. To cope and evolve, we need a moral inversion to prize resilience over stability. 

To learn from biology, immunity isn_ defense. It_ adaptation through exposure. Resilience is not resistance to change, it_ the capacity to integrate adaptation without collapse.

A new moral philosophy
Our civilization worships wealth, power and status. They are the most prized and sought after possessions. 

People will kill for them, die for them, and make others die so that they can die for them.

It_ a self-terminating feedback loop. A morality of entropy. 

Don_ Die is the inversion of this moral architecture. It replaces the pursuit of domination with the pursuit of continuation.

Open AI is still the clear leader but, interestingly, they are loosing percentage share as the market grows. This is normal for a category leader but it_ curious who they are losing share to. It_ not really to other startups but incumbents with existing, massive distribution. This means that Google has a huge runway ahead of itself as their models and services become better. It also means that when/if Meta gets their act together, they will be able to gain share quickly. Lastly, it likely means that xAI will need to license Grok aggressively OR acquire existing distribution for their models - Snapchat, Pinterest etc.

_ don't think China is a rising power. I think China is a re-ascending power.

_f you think about it in that context, especially as a Confucian society, I think the Chinese think about this as, _old on, this is reasserting the dominance that we've always had._

_he other interesting thing, which I learned studying China, is how they allocate capital.

2025-10-19,neutral,"When ppl claim this I always wonder how they think it happens, or have unrealistic expectations on how much $1bn actually is. 

I joined crypto with $200. If I held my initial bitcoin since then and never traded, I would have ~$300k.

If, instead, from that moment I sold the top and bought the bottom of every crypto cycle on Bitcoin, and never paid any taxes, I would have ~$6m USD.

If I put my entire net worth into the Ethereum ICO and never touched it, today I would have ~$150m pre-tax. 

While it was definitely possible to have made >$1bn with the opportunities in the market, these versions of reality would also require me to make no mistakes, and have no need to spend $ in real life, or take excessive risk via leverage. 

In reality, I grew up in a working class family. I didn_ have a trust fund and I had to pay off my student loan myself. I had a job at Tescos while at high school.  After university, I needed to pay rent and fund cost of living and eventually buy a place to live. 

I worked at startups for relatively little $ salary, and while a couple have done okay, they still are illiquid and worth nothing until some exit. 

Perhaps if I erase a couple of dumb mistakes and drawdowns, or if I had a lil more grind, then my answer would be different today. But it is easy to say this with perfect hindsight vision. It_ easy to see where you could have optimised better, and decisions you made look dumb when the past makes things so obvious. 

The truth is I have always optimised for enjoying my life and not going to 0. I never felt like I had a safety net, so it was never possible for me to do anything in any other way. I would probably have less money if I had tried to add more risk or chased $ harder, because being all-in with your entire livelihood is a mental battle and I feel I only win that battle when the stakes are lower. 

In writing this, maybe I do understand why CT folks believe this, because modern CT sees crypto as a late-stage lottery ticket farm, where the optimal strategy is to 5x leverage up your portfolio in a hope of catching a good 20% move and then leaving. Or, literally going all-in on the next coin they heard Ansem is buying. So perhaps to them, looking back at the charts, of course that_ what successful folks did. 

In reality, I use leverage close to never (and typically to reduce risk rather than add risk  have used it to add risk maybe 3 times in the last 5 years, and maybe 15 times ever). I never go all-in on anything, have only ever done that on BTC and ETH before in the last decade. When I buy other things, I limit risk to tiny amounts, because I treat it as a 0 until proven otherwise (so, always <1% liquid portfolio). Liquid portfolio is also a smaller % of overall portfolio to future-proof against my own fuckups. 

Obviously I made a lot of money, I have been here 12 years! CT doesn_ want to hear about _etting rich in a decade though.

2025-10-19,neutral,"regarding where we r in the cycle, the story is quite simple to me. there's one factor that outweighs everything else, including ur fav liquidity metric and technical indicator. and that's ai.  

if the ai bubble pops, its over. if ai stonks keep going up, all the bears r wrong.

its never possible to call cycle tops or bottoms with 100% conviction, but as far as i can tell, we r in the danger zone. (ive been collecting top signals and tweeting about them this past month.) yes we might get a blow off top similar to the one in oct 1999 - mar 2000, but the r/r of being max long is v poor.

a useful mental model is that cycle tops and bottoms are not points in time, or a price levels, but rather, a risk spectrum. i will always stay invested because high risk does not mean we have to go down. but at the same time its completely fine to dramatically reduce risk as we go further along the risk spectrum.

2025-10-19,all,"When ppl claim this I always wonder how they think it happens, or have unrealistic expectations on how much $1bn actually is. 

I joined crypto with $200. If I held my initial bitcoin since then and never traded, I would have ~$300k.

If, instead, from that moment I sold the top and bought the bottom of every crypto cycle on Bitcoin, and never paid any taxes, I would have ~$6m USD.

If I put my entire net worth into the Ethereum ICO and never touched it, today I would have ~$150m pre-tax. 

While it was definitely possible to have made >$1bn with the opportunities in the market, these versions of reality would also require me to make no mistakes, and have no need to spend $ in real life, or take excessive risk via leverage. 

In reality, I grew up in a working class family. I didn_ have a trust fund and I had to pay off my student loan myself. I had a job at Tescos while at high school.  After university, I needed to pay rent and fund cost of living and eventually buy a place to live. 

I worked at startups for relatively little $ salary, and while a couple have done okay, they still are illiquid and worth nothing until some exit. 

Perhaps if I erase a couple of dumb mistakes and drawdowns, or if I had a lil more grind, then my answer would be different today. But it is easy to say this with perfect hindsight vision. It_ easy to see where you could have optimised better, and decisions you made look dumb when the past makes things so obvious. 

The truth is I have always optimised for enjoying my life and not going to 0. I never felt like I had a safety net, so it was never possible for me to do anything in any other way. I would probably have less money if I had tried to add more risk or chased $ harder, because being all-in with your entire livelihood is a mental battle and I feel I only win that battle when the stakes are lower. 

In writing this, maybe I do understand why CT folks believe this, because modern CT sees crypto as a late-stage lottery ticket farm, where the optimal strategy is to 5x leverage up your portfolio in a hope of catching a good 20% move and then leaving. Or, literally going all-in on the next coin they heard Ansem is buying. So perhaps to them, looking back at the charts, of course that_ what successful folks did. 

In reality, I use leverage close to never (and typically to reduce risk rather than add risk  have used it to add risk maybe 3 times in the last 5 years, and maybe 15 times ever). I never go all-in on anything, have only ever done that on BTC and ETH before in the last decade. When I buy other things, I limit risk to tiny amounts, because I treat it as a 0 until proven otherwise (so, always <1% liquid portfolio). Liquid portfolio is also a smaller % of overall portfolio to future-proof against my own fuckups. 

Obviously I made a lot of money, I have been here 12 years! CT doesn_ want to hear about _etting rich in a decade though. I am happy with where I am and have never really cared or optimised for maximising $ earnings, but instead having a nice life that lets me enjoy the game we play together.",2025-10-19 05:51:00+00:00,979.0,1884.0,15872.0,22577.0

Open AI is still the clear leader but, interestingly, they are loosing percentage share as the market grows. This is normal for a category leader but it_ curious who they are losing share to. It_ not really to other startups but incumbents with existing, massive distribution. This means that Google has a huge runway ahead of itself as their models and services become better. It also means that when/if Meta gets their act together, they will be able to gain share quickly. Lastly, it likely means that xAI will need to license Grok aggressively OR acquire existing distribution for their models - Snapchat, Pinterest etc.

_ don't think China is a rising power. I think China is a re-ascending power.

_f you think about it in that context, especially as a Confucian society, I think the Chinese think about this as, _old on, this is reasserting the dominance that we've always had._

_ou have Xi Jinping and his close circle of people, they dictate the priorities, right?

Paradigm is particular good at this. Subgoals include progressing the systems of the world towards rigorous decentralization, credibly neutrality, censorship resistance, and intrinsic privacy/confidentiality to the extent that such a world is more profitable -- and healthy in other ways -- for themselves and their investors.

As @fede_intern indicated, it is not news that Paradigm has been working to ""own"" Ethereum for years._ That said, I don't believe there is reason for concern, and consider this kind of behavior natural and inevitable. And the gold rush of corpo-chains is validating for the traditional economy and signals our mainstreaming._ Yes, I would prefer that Mallesh and Dankrad would focus their talent and energies fully on Ethereum. But both probably do need a fresh context to energize them, and since both are pure researchers, I expect they will continue to write papers and contribute broadly, as they indicated they would.

We need VCs for now because they represent a comfortable bridge for the world's capital to flow into our ecosystem. Very soon better, fairer, more broadly accessible onchain investment platforms with healthy tokenomics will mature sufficiently so that VCs will have no choice but to set up shop on these platforms, if they want to stay in the game. In bringing progressive decentralization to everything -- even up through layers of identity, reputation and governance -- we are on the precipice of totally changing the way the world works.

Ethereum will win -- already has won -- its niche: rigorously decentralized, credibly neutral digital asset settlement ledger infrastructure._ It will establish itself as the world ledger, and then ethos/philosophy and economics will enable it to expand ""up the stack"" to become the world computer, as more apps get built and protocolized and tokenized._ Corpo-chains will be important infrastructure built on top of neutral permissionless chains, just as SQL, No SQL, graph and vector DBs and many other kinds of database connect commercial endeavors to the internet and web. Next generation databases will validate, be verifiable, will be tamper-proof, will maintain an inspectable log of their history and they will all speak token -- the language of the decentralized economy.

IMO that is a BIG misunderstanding. Yes, there is a 4y halving cycle that doubles S2F-ratio, and 6 months before until 18 months after a halving was very profitable last 3 cycles. But, 3 cycles is not enough for a reliable pattern, and it is absolutely not guaranteed that the top is again 18 months after the halving (Oct'25!).

So IMO the top could very well be in 2026, or 2027, or 2028 ... actually I am much more interested in the average price level than the top (or the bottom).

What I do know is: there has not been a fundamental bitcoin phase transition yet in this cycle. Realized price (grey line) has not diverted from 200 week moving average (black line), RSI has not been 80+ (red) etc. Either the big jump has yet to come, or we have transitioned into a more stable price regime, dominated by institutions, fund mandates (e.g. 1%-10% btc) and rebalancing (sell after pump and buy after dump, to keep exposures within mandate). Both scenarios are very bullish for bitcoin. Also, IMO there can not be a big bear market without a big jump (red RSI 80+ and grey realized price diverting from black 200wma).",2025-10-20 13:07:00+00:00,430.0,1058.0,6890.0,10296.0

2025-10-20,all,"Yes, the goal of @paradigm and many other VCs is to suck as much value as possible from the Ethereum and broader ecosystem, while also adding value to the ecosystem in the service of maximizing their own gains. Paradigm is particular good at this. Subgoals include progressing the systems of the world towards rigorous decentralization, credibly neutrality, censorship resistance, and intrinsic privacy/confidentiality to the extent that such a world is more profitable -- and healthy in other ways -- for themselves and their investors.

As @fede_intern indicated, it is not news that Paradigm has been working to ""own"" Ethereum for years._ That said, I don't believe there is reason for concern, and consider this kind of behavior natural and inevitable. And the gold rush of corpo-chains is validating for the traditional economy and signals our mainstreaming._ Yes, I would prefer that Mallesh and Dankrad would focus their talent and energies fully on Ethereum. But both probably do need a fresh context to energize them, and since both are pure researchers, I expect they will continue to write papers and contribute broadly, as they indicated they would.

We need VCs for now because they represent a comfortable bridge for the world's capital to flow into our ecosystem. Very soon better, fairer, more broadly accessible onchain investment platforms with healthy tokenomics will mature sufficiently so that VCs will have no choice but to set up shop on these platforms, if they want to stay in the game. In bringing progressive decentralization to everything -- even up through layers of identity, reputation and governance -- we are on the precipice of totally changing the way the world works.

Ethereum will win -- already has won -- its niche: rigorously decentralized, credibly neutral digital asset settlement ledger infrastructure._ It will establish itself as the world ledger, and then ethos/philosophy and economics will enable it to expand ""up the stack"" to become the world computer, as more apps get built and protocolized and tokenized._ Corpo-chains will be important infrastructure built on top of neutral permissionless chains, just as SQL, No SQL, graph and vector DBs and many other kinds of database connect commercial endeavors to the internet and web. Next generation databases will validate, be verifiable, will be tamper-proof, will maintain an inspectable log of their history and they will all speak token -- the language of the decentralized economy. When all of this matures, the world will finally have a secure global information infrastructure.

Best wishes to Dankrad and Mallesh. They will always be friends and teammates.",2025-10-20 14:25:00+00:00,120.0,190.0,1402.0,2142.0

2025-10-25,positive,"Why AI is Underhyped and Isn't a Bubble Yet

Here's why AI isn't a bubble today. I've distilled the data points and ideas from my previous columns and coverage. If you prefer facts and evidence-based reality over vibes and conflated narratives, enjoy!

-Big Tech valuations are reasonable and leverage is low. We're at the beginning of multiple AI super product cycles in the year ahead
-We are in the early innings of a technology computing shift to AI, the largest in decades. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-Every credible source reports overwhelming demand for AI computing capacity. Where is the overcapacity glut? Nowhere. 

Valuations
-During the dotcom bubble, top technology stocks like Microsoft and Cisco traded at 70 to 100 times forward P/E in December 1999 (remember these stocks went significantly higher in Q1 2000 too) versus today's top stocks (Nvidia etc.) trading at 30x with materially better underlying fundamental growth prospects.
-The positive cycle sentiment remains in early stages. The Netscape IPO occurred in 1995, five years before the cycle peak. Is there any doubt the eventual OpenAI IPO will be a Netscape-type success? AI is only two to three years in. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-The major buyers of AI infrastructure are the most profitable businesses in history, each generating roughly $100 billion in annual net profit. This is nothing like the debt-driven fiber optic network buildout of the dotcom era.

Generational Secular Computing Shift
-The global TAM for IT spending is $5-6 trillion annually. The entire technology stack needs restructuring and rearchitecting for AI because this new technology produces better results for corporations and consumers. You either use it or get disrupted by rivals who do.
-Think electrification. Think the advent of the microprocessor and personal computer in the early 1980s. It's that significant.
-The first growth wave was driven by natural language processing with LLMs and the application of parallel GPU computing. For the first time, computers could understand context from user language input. Previously, if you typed one character wrong in a query request, the computer would fail. GPUs allowed companies to apply incredible computing power to distill and compress knowledge from vast pools of unstructured data.
-The current second wave of growth is driven by reasoning models that are significantly more accurate and useful by spending more time working on requests and searching dozens of websites. Reasoning models use 100 to 1,000 times more compute resources than prior models. The next wave will feature increased use of multi-modal models (audio/video) and agents (workflow automation, multi-step tasks). The following wave will be driven by physical AI, drug discovery, factory simulation, and robotics.

AI Bubble Skeptic Arguments
-Skeptics focus on simplistic narratives without nuance. It's up a lot, so it must be a bubble. OpenAI is losing a lot money!
-This mirrors narratives from earlier this year when skeptics claimed the DeepSeek moment meant expensive training runs were no longer needed because DeepSeek was trained with only $6 million in spending (a false statement especially as literally in the same week China announced $140 billion in new AI investment). They also claimed DeepSeek's efficiency meant a computing glut was ahead. Both views proved categorically false and misleading as reasoning models (including DeepSeek!) and better AI models sparked an exponential wave of AI computing demand over the last nine months.
-OpenAI's business model divides into two parts. Training new models requires enormous fixed investment, with each model driving roughly 10x more spending. Inference, serving already developed and built models, is extremely profitable.
-Do you believe leading AI edge models will be a foundational technology transforming every business worldwide? The answer is yes. Companies view the risk as existential.
-100% of Nvidia's engineers use AI coding assistants like Cursor. These AI assistants make engineers more productive by autocompleting code and automatically fixing bugs. All developers will use AI assistants in the future. Customer service? Same. AI will improve chatbots for customer service while giving live agents all the information they need from prior conversations and the latest product updates to improve service quality. Sales agents? Same. Product research and development? Same. AI will test product ideas and iterations while simulating every permutation.
-This is happening and will continue happening. It_ inevitable. Every company will use AI in every part of their business. I spoke with executives from Nvidia, Dell, and Microsoft this month. It's occurring everywhere and accelerating.

Circularity
-Thus far, the vast majority of spending has come from profitable large technology companies. Now concerns about circular vendor spend is rising.
-Despite what you hear, much of this hasn't occurred yet, and each gigawatt of spending depends on specific performance technical milestones on both sides (AMD-OpenAI deal).
-Yes, the Oracle-OpenAI deal is real with hundreds of billions in RPO. Let's assume it's $300 billion over five years, requiring roughly $60 billion annually.
-Alphabet/Google generates about $400 billion in sales with $120 billion profit. Meta generates $200 billion in sales with $73 billion profit. 
-Markets and investors look at the potential future not the present or past. The question becomes can OpenAI eventually become a technology giant using their AI model advantage and product execution abilities? ChatGPT's user base has grown from 0 to 800 million in three years. Can it reach 2 or 3 billion in another three years? It seems achievable. Like Google in its early years, ChatGPT currently has a scale advantage where the large user base has started a flywheel, enabling ChatGPT to iterate, improve, get more data, and A/B test better answers for users.

Nvidia NVL72 Super Cycle  Pre-iPhone Moment
-Dan Benton noted that technology investing revolves around product cycles. In just over two years, Nvidia has increased its quarterly data center revenue tenfold. As impressive as this is, the company will likely experience its best product cycle ever over the next few quarters, comparable to the iPhone launch.
-Nvidia has recently begun shipping GB200/GB300 NVL72 servers in volume for the first time. Foxconn, a major AI server manufacturer for Nvidia, reports that current quarter AI server revenue will increase 170% year-over-year.
-What is the NVL72? The first AI server with 72 GPUs in one server rack versus 8 GPUs in prior models. It offers 25 to 30 times better performance than the previous model and will enable more AI capabilities and use cases. Each server weighs 1.5 tons, contains 5,000 copper cables (2 miles), and offers unprecedented computing density.

AI Demand Signs
-EVERY credible industry source reports off-the-charts demand and overwhelming compute shortages everywhere. EVERY SINGLE ONE.
-Microsoft's Scott Guthrie, head of the Cloud + AI group at Microsoft and member of the senior executive team, told me this month he sees an ""explosion"" of AI infrastructure usage ahead, driven by reasoning/agents and workflow automation.
-TD Cowen: ""Based on our checks, 3Q25 would represent the largest inflection in demand we have seen since the inception of the data center industry... a staggering ~7.4GW of U.S. data center capacity was leased by hyperscalers in 3Q25, which would exceed all capacity leased in 2024."" Largest inflection in demand in history. Right now. More capacity in one quarter than all of last year.
-TSMC's CEO says AI demand is ""stronger than"" they thought three months ago. Given the strength three months ago, that's remarkable. He then literally describes today's growth as ""insane,"" strongly hinting at guidance and capex raises in January.
-Four-year-old A100 GPUs remain profitable today on inference tasks.
-Microsoft AI startup employee states: ""Many days it feels my whole job is begging for GPUs. It's been that way since 2020 and hasn't become easier.""
-Anthropic's ARR grew from $1 billion to $7 billion in 10 months.
-Crusoe CEO: ""Every single customer we talk to is compute-constrained right now.""
-AI token consumption data points from Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google show exponential growth YTD.

2025-10-25,all,"Why AI is Underhyped and Isn't a Bubble Yet

Here's why AI isn't a bubble today. I've distilled the data points and ideas from my previous columns and coverage. If you prefer facts and evidence-based reality over vibes and conflated narratives, enjoy!

-Big Tech valuations are reasonable and leverage is low. We're at the beginning of multiple AI super product cycles in the year ahead
-We are in the early innings of a technology computing shift to AI, the largest in decades. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-Every credible source reports overwhelming demand for AI computing capacity. Where is the overcapacity glut? Nowhere. 

Valuations
-During the dotcom bubble, top technology stocks like Microsoft and Cisco traded at 70 to 100 times forward P/E in December 1999 (remember these stocks went significantly higher in Q1 2000 too) versus today's top stocks (Nvidia etc.) trading at 30x with materially better underlying fundamental growth prospects.
-The positive cycle sentiment remains in early stages. The Netscape IPO occurred in 1995, five years before the cycle peak. Is there any doubt the eventual OpenAI IPO will be a Netscape-type success? AI is only two to three years in. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-The major buyers of AI infrastructure are the most profitable businesses in history, each generating roughly $100 billion in annual net profit. This is nothing like the debt-driven fiber optic network buildout of the dotcom era.

Generational Secular Computing Shift
-The global TAM for IT spending is $5-6 trillion annually. The entire technology stack needs restructuring and rearchitecting for AI because this new technology produces better results for corporations and consumers. You either use it or get disrupted by rivals who do.
-Think electrification. Think the advent of the microprocessor and personal computer in the early 1980s. It's that significant.
-The first growth wave was driven by natural language processing with LLMs and the application of parallel GPU computing. For the first time, computers could understand context from user language input. Previously, if you typed one character wrong in a query request, the computer would fail. GPUs allowed companies to apply incredible computing power to distill and compress knowledge from vast pools of unstructured data.
-The current second wave of growth is driven by reasoning models that are significantly more accurate and useful by spending more time working on requests and searching dozens of websites. Reasoning models use 100 to 1,000 times more compute resources than prior models. The next wave will feature increased use of multi-modal models (audio/video) and agents (workflow automation, multi-step tasks). The following wave will be driven by physical AI, drug discovery, factory simulation, and robotics.

AI Bubble Skeptic Arguments
-Skeptics focus on simplistic narratives without nuance. It's up a lot, so it must be a bubble. OpenAI is losing a lot money!
-This mirrors narratives from earlier this year when skeptics claimed the DeepSeek moment meant expensive training runs were no longer needed because DeepSeek was trained with only $6 million in spending (a false statement especially as literally in the same week China announced $140 billion in new AI investment). They also claimed DeepSeek's efficiency meant a computing glut was ahead. Both views proved categorically false and misleading as reasoning models (including DeepSeek!) and better AI models sparked an exponential wave of AI computing demand over the last nine months.
-OpenAI's business model divides into two parts. Training new models requires enormous fixed investment, with each model driving roughly 10x more spending. Inference, serving already developed and built models, is extremely profitable.
-Do you believe leading AI edge models will be a foundational technology transforming every business worldwide? The answer is yes. Companies view the risk as existential.
-100% of Nvidia's engineers use AI coding assistants like Cursor. These AI assistants make engineers more productive by autocompleting code and automatically fixing bugs. All developers will use AI assistants in the future. Customer service? Same. AI will improve chatbots for customer service while giving live agents all the information they need from prior conversations and the latest product updates to improve service quality. Sales agents? Same. Product research and development? Same. AI will test product ideas and iterations while simulating every permutation.
-This is happening and will continue happening. It_ inevitable. Every company will use AI in every part of their business. I spoke with executives from Nvidia, Dell, and Microsoft this month. It's occurring everywhere and accelerating.

Circularity
-Thus far, the vast majority of spending has come from profitable large technology companies. Now concerns about circular vendor spend is rising.
-Despite what you hear, much of this hasn't occurred yet, and each gigawatt of spending depends on specific performance technical milestones on both sides (AMD-OpenAI deal).
-Yes, the Oracle-OpenAI deal is real with hundreds of billions in RPO. Let's assume it's $300 billion over five years, requiring roughly $60 billion annually.
-Alphabet/Google generates about $400 billion in sales with $120 billion profit. Meta generates $200 billion in sales with $73 billion profit. 
-Markets and investors look at the potential future not the present or past. The question becomes can OpenAI eventually become a technology giant using their AI model advantage and product execution abilities? ChatGPT's user base has grown from 0 to 800 million in three years. Can it reach 2 or 3 billion in another three years? It seems achievable. Like Google in its early years, ChatGPT currently has a scale advantage where the large user base has started a flywheel, enabling ChatGPT to iterate, improve, get more data, and A/B test better answers for users.

Nvidia NVL72 Super Cycle  Pre-iPhone Moment
-Dan Benton noted that technology investing revolves around product cycles. In just over two years, Nvidia has increased its quarterly data center revenue tenfold. As impressive as this is, the company will likely experience its best product cycle ever over the next few quarters, comparable to the iPhone launch.
-Nvidia has recently begun shipping GB200/GB300 NVL72 servers in volume for the first time. Foxconn, a major AI server manufacturer for Nvidia, reports that current quarter AI server revenue will increase 170% year-over-year.
-What is the NVL72? The first AI server with 72 GPUs in one server rack versus 8 GPUs in prior models. It offers 25 to 30 times better performance than the previous model and will enable more AI capabilities and use cases. Each server weighs 1.5 tons, contains 5,000 copper cables (2 miles), and offers unprecedented computing density.

AI Demand Signs
-EVERY credible industry source reports off-the-charts demand and overwhelming compute shortages everywhere. EVERY SINGLE ONE.
-Microsoft's Scott Guthrie, head of the Cloud + AI group at Microsoft and member of the senior executive team, told me this month he sees an ""explosion"" of AI infrastructure usage ahead, driven by reasoning/agents and workflow automation.
-TD Cowen: ""Based on our checks, 3Q25 would represent the largest inflection in demand we have seen since the inception of the data center industry... a staggering ~7.4GW of U.S. data center capacity was leased by hyperscalers in 3Q25, which would exceed all capacity leased in 2024."" Largest inflection in demand in history. Right now. More capacity in one quarter than all of last year.
-TSMC's CEO says AI demand is ""stronger than"" they thought three months ago. Given the strength three months ago, that's remarkable. He then literally describes today's growth as ""insane,"" strongly hinting at guidance and capex raises in January.
-Four-year-old A100 GPUs remain profitable today on inference tasks.
-Microsoft AI startup employee states: ""Many days it feels my whole job is begging for GPUs. It's been that way since 2020 and hasn't become easier.""
-Anthropic's ARR grew from $1 billion to $7 billion in 10 months.
-Crusoe CEO: ""Every single customer we talk to is compute-constrained right now.""
-AI token consumption data points from Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google show exponential growth YTD.

+++

In many parts of the world, money doesn_ work the way it should.

I saw this firsthand during my time traveling through Zimbabwe in 2013, and it_ actually how I first got into crypto. Inflation eats away at savings. Banks remain out of reach. Currencies lose value overnight. Yet people still need to save, send, and spend and they deserve tools they can rely on._

My conviction from 12 years ago that crypto can solve these issues remains. Specifically, we believe crypto and stablecoins can offer that reliability, building open, borderless systems that make financial access possible for anyone with a phone.

That_ why @liz_harkavy and I are proud to announce that we're leading a $12.9M funding round for @zardotapp, a platform bringing digital dollars to cash economies across emerging markets.
ZAR is building a new financial layer that bridges the gap between local cash and digital currency.

By partnering with neighborhood merchants, ZAR lets anyone convert physical cash into stablecoins and back again through a simple, familiar experience. Its decentralized infrastructure aligns the people who grow the network (from merchants to community partners), creating a transparent, incentive-driven system for expanding global financial access.
This architecture scales trust. Merchants earn more than traditional money services, ambassadors build their own networks, and fraud is mitigated through smart contracts and cryptographic verification. It_ a bottom-up system designed for the realities of high-friction, high-inflation markets.

Founded by @tmnsky (previously built Pakistan_ leading neobank, @sadapaypk) and @sebscholl, ZAR is launching first in Pakistan, with expansion plans across Africa and Latin America.

We believe ZAR can become a cornerstone for stablecoin adoption, helping people everywhere store, move, and build with money that holds its value.
Excited to support Brandon, Sebastian, and the ZAR team as they bring digital dollars on-chain to the world.",2025-10-28 16:51:00+00:00,29.0,19.0,157.0,282.0

2025-10-29,positive,"Update on our next phase of growth (long post)

TL/DR: Blockworks is becoming a software/data first org

When Mike and I started Blockworks in 2017, we wanted to solve ""the information problem."" Crypto was growing up fast and the new entrants deserved better information.

We've built everything from events to podcasts, research, data, and news. 

As we_e scaled, we_e experienced massive growth across all business units: we've had record revenues in 2025 and we'll have another record year in 2026. 

Over the past two years, we have seen particularly rapid growth in our data business. The market is telling us that our combo of data + distribution is extremely valuable. Every day, we hear from both investors and protocols that Blockworks data is critical to their daily workflow.

And so, we're going all in on what Mike and I believe is the greatest opportunity we_e seen since launching Blockworks in 2017. More on this soon :) 

Now, to talk about news... 

Mike and I launched news in 2021 as an extension of our events, podcasts, and newsletter businesses. 

At the time, crypto media couldn't speak fluently to tradfi, and trad media couldn't understand crypto. 

Since then, Blockworks has broken big stories, published thousands of stories, been cited by nearly every major publication, and helped shape the industry conversation every day. I am very proud of the work that the team has done.

But the landscape is changing and the same problems don_ exist today. 

There are many strong crypto media publications. Great journalists combined with new tools have raised the bar in reporting, and traditional outlets have also improved. Meanwhile, users are increasingly looking toward data as a primary information source.

So we_e decided to sharpen our focus on software and data and exit our news business.

To our incredible news team: a huge, heartfelt thank you. You built something that helped shape the industry and fueled the growth of Blockworks. I have a deep amount of respect for all that you do. To anyone hiring crypto journalists, please reach out  everyone is incredible.

To the broader Blockworks community: over the coming months, you_l see Blockworks evolve into a data-first intelligence platform. Our website will become a true data destination. Our main newsletters and podcasts will continue to set the pace for conversations that drive the industry. Our events will continue to grow (DAS is coming to Abu Dhabi next year). 

And we_e rolling out more category-defining software and data products soon.

Love you all, onwards.",2025-10-29 18:01:00+00:00,147.0,34.0,624.0,1133.0

Trump's tariff news sparked it. But Binance froze. APIs failed. Traders locked out. Stops never triggered. Bitcoin dipped to $102,000 on Binance spot. Coinbase held at $105,000. Kraken near $104,500. Small gaps. Big signals.

$ATOM suffered worse. #Cosmos  token flashed to $0.001 on #Binance. Zero liquidity. No mercy. @coinbase  stayed at $2.54. Stablecoins depegged there too. USDe to $0.66 on Binance. Others barely moved. Thin books met glitches. Exploits slipped through. The whole market lost $560 billion. You felt trapped if you traded there.

All of this goes on as @brian_armstrong  and others in crypto are trying to put into place a framework for the USA and abroad for clarity in crypto.

How on earth can Binance not have anything to answer for here?

Where are the voices to put pressure on getting to the bottom of this. I didn't get hurt during the crash because I don't trade with Binance but how can we possibly just ignore the giant elephant in the room and move on as if nothing happened?

The music artist ""Shifty Brent"" is AI and it's incredible... beyond incredible... think of Blaxploitation + James Brown + Sly + Curtis Mayfield.  The AI remixes Rap into the black music rebellion music of the 60's and 70's. 

OK, my mind is blown... the music is exceptional. 

Nothing will be the same again... 

In the future we will interact with AI artists via video chat bots ( we will be their friend and share their AI generated lives and the dram that ensues) and we will see them tour via hologram (ABBA have been doing it for 4 years now).

How we adapt to this amount of change is beyond my understanding but I do know that the equal and opposite force will apply itself and we will crave live, real, visceral  human experiences too and they will be a premium but AI will create new experiences in different ways. Why do you think sports teams keep going up in value? Its a signal.

It really is us adapting to new apex species and reorganizing society.

Here are 28 things the ecosystem accomplished over the last month.

1/ Bhutan becomes the first nation to anchor its national digital ID system on Ethereum, showing how governments can use open infrastructure to keep public identity systems secure, sovereign, and verifiable.

2/ @JovayNetwork by Ant Group (creator of AliPay) are building the next era of Layer 2, connecting one of the world_ largest payment networks with open, global infrastructure.

3/ Stablecoin transfers on @ethereum hit $5T last quarter. Onchain payments continue to become the internet_ settlement layer for global value.

4/ ERC-8004 went live, enabling AI agents to discover and trust each other without intermediaries, a step toward open, autonomous agent economies built on Ethereum.

5/ @ADIChain_ joined the @zksync Elastic Network, launching the first dirham-backed stablecoin with major UAE banks, a strong link between regulated finance and open settlement infrastructure.

6/ @centrifuge launched SPXA, the first tokenized S&P 500 Index Fund licensed by @SPDJIndices and deployed on @base, bringing traditional market exposure directly into the onchain economy.

7/ The Ethereum for Institutions site is now live. The new site acts as a resource for builders, leaders, and institutions.

8/ @WalletConnect Pay went live with @dtc_pay, enabling seamless stablecoin payments across retail and hospitality in Asia, bridging onchain money with everyday transactions.

9/ @Lighter_xyz launched its mainnet after eight months in private beta, bringing low-cost, low-latency perpetual trading to Ethereum L2 with verifiable matching and liquidations for high-performance DeFi.

10/ @fluidkey launched its new app on iOS, Android, and web, combining privacy-preserving accounts, stealth addresses, yield, swaps, and biometric security in one onchain wallet.

2025-11-04,positive,"Something that requires forcing other people to provide it cannot be a human right. 

Why? Because it conflicts with itself under any examination. It is a self-defeating assertion of morality.

You have a right to yourself, and to that which you can acquire without violating the same right of others. 

You have a right to your body, to your speech and your thoughts, to sunshine in the day and darkness at night, to your own ideas and that which you teach yourself, and to the air you breathe. If you grow your own food, of course you have a right to it. If something is given or taught to you freely, you have a right to that as well. So far, no violation of the same right in others. Consistent moral harmony.  

But you do not have a right to food that isn't voluntarily given to you, just because you're hungry.  Nor to healthcare or education, when it must be provided by another person involuntarily. 

Why? Because if you did, it would violate the very right you're presuming of yourself: namely, the right to your body and the product of it.  To demand another provide for you is to violate the principle of your own self-ownership. A contradiction in claim. 

If I can grow my own food and it is mine, then my neighbor cannot claim any right to take it from me.  He may ask, and if he's starving I should provide help as a good human, but there is no moral claim which should forcefully compel me. Again, if there was, then the fundamental right is now in conflict with itself. And if my neighbor has no right to seize my bread by force, he certainly doesn't have the right to enlist politicians to do so on his behalf, regardless of how many friends he can find to ""vote"" for the same. 

Needless to say, those who claim we have a right to food taken by force from others never define the limits of a such a right because it's based on absurdity from the start. *Which* food do you have a right to?  How much of it? Must it be organic? You have a right to healthcare?  Okay, how much of that, and from which Doctor? Do you have a right to band-aids and vitamins? To MRI machines? To the best MRI machine or only last year's model?  Such claims of right become preposterous upon any examination. 

Good ethics should not be contradictory on topics so fundamental to civilization.  You cannot have a right to the product of others.

Many assume losses equal system failure. However, in open financial systems, losses are a natural consequence of risk-taking, even when systems operate exactly as designed. As an industry, we should not fall for the fallacy that yield is risk-free. Instead, we should focus on better surfacing and educating about risks  ourselves included.

The free buses and government grocery stores won_ happen, they never do. They sound good during campaigns, but collapse under basic math. You can_ run a city on ideas that cost billions and produce no revenue.

The only way to make housing affordable is to build more housing. The free market lowers prices, not regulation. Every time politicians try to control rent or force affordability by decree, developers stop building and landlords stop maintaining. Supply dries up, the quality collapses, and the few properties that remain skyrocket in price.

Once landlords can_ make a profit, they sell, lose properties, or walk away. Eventually, the government takes over.

Taxes will rise to pay for the promises, and the middle class will be the ones shouldering the burden. The rich will relocate, the poor will depend on subsidies, and the productive class will be squeezed from both sides.

Thriving businesses are the foundation of any thriving city. When they leave, everything else follows, jobs, schools, grocery stores, stability. Chicago already proved this.

The free buses and government grocery stores won_ happen, they never do. They sound good during campaigns, but collapse under basic math. You can_ run a city on ideas that cost billions and produce no revenue.

The only way to make housing affordable is to build more housing. The free market lowers prices, not regulation. Every time politicians try to control rent or force affordability by decree, developers stop building and landlords stop maintaining. Supply dries up, the quality collapses, and the few properties that remain skyrocket in price.

Once landlords can_ make a profit, they sell, lose properties, or walk away. Eventually, the government takes over.

Taxes will rise to pay for the promises, and the middle class will be the ones shouldering the burden. The rich will relocate, the poor will depend on subsidies, and the productive class will be squeezed from both sides.

Thriving businesses are the foundation of any thriving city. When they leave, everything else follows, jobs, schools, grocery stores, stability. Chicago already proved this. Boeing, McDonald_, Caterpillar, Citadel, nearly 70k jobs, all gone. Now they_e facing billion-dollar deficits, half empty schools and neighborhoods without grocery stores.

I saw someone who lived in a rent-controlled apartment in California put it perfectly, he said his landlord could no longer afford maintenance so the pool was filled with dirt, the floors had soft spots, and the foundation ended up cracking. That_ what overregulation does, it destroys quality.

People who voted for this will eventually feel the pain but they won_ blame the policies or the politicians, they_l blame the rich for leaving.

This conversation is always difficult because most people simply don_ understand market dynamics or incentives. In a free society, people act in their own self-interest. If you remove profit and reward dependency, productivity dies and the city with it.

Monad has been built painstakingly over the past 3.5 years. We take a long term view and aren_ afraid to do things differently from others.

Today, ahead of the launch of the Public Mainnet, I_ like to share an important element of the Monad tokenomics design: locked MON may not be staked.

Time and time again in previous blockchain launches, the crypto community has had the same complaint: insiders ability to stake and earn rewards (liquid or otherwise) on locked tokens. We heard those complaints and are taking a firm stance on this matter, in an effort to set a new standard for the space.

The north star of Monad is true decentralization. The network will go live with 200 globally distributed validators that are run on consumer-grade hardware. While it would have been easier to cut corners, our team has taken the hard road in designing a system that delivers both performance and decentralization. What we build must stand the test of time. I believe that this firm stance on staking of locked tokens similarly positions Monad toward long-term success through better token distribution.

On a personal note, I appreciate the support of investors including @paradigm, @dragonfly_xyz, @ElectricCapital, and @CastleIslandVC. We build for the long term and are grateful for the long-term-oriented thinking and support of Monad_ earliest backers.

me thinking about how during the 10/10 crypto liquidation event some mysterious wallet got funded with 80-160 million USDC right before Trump's tariff post on China and then opened over a billion in shorts on BTC and ETH with perfect timing down to the minute and closed them at the exact bottom for 160-200 million profit which is impossible without insider info from Trump's circle since his family holds billions in WLFI tokens that dipped 25-30% but they bought back 1.4 million worth right after like they knew it was a setup to clean out leverage and then Binance and Bybit suddenly had ""technical issues"" freezing orders so traders couldn't close positions or buy the dip while the short whale executed flawlessly and at the same time oracles misfired prices causing stablecoins like USDE to de-peg to 0.65 only on Binance which triggered a cascade of unfair liquidations wiping 1.6 million accounts and 19-40 billion total but insurance funds barely budged and ADL kicked in clipping winners unevenly and market makers like Wintermute moved 700 million including 200 million BTC to Binance hours before like they were prepping the harvest and then data sites like Coinglass got hacked so no one could see the real numbers in real time and exchanges admitted to ""system congestion"" rejecting close orders with error codes -4118 -2022 -1008 while liquidations ran perfectly against retail and some positions got nuked 25x over even with low leverage because collateral was marked at bogus prints and then rumors spread of two massive trading firms going to zero forced to dump their entire top-100 token books in a fire sale amplifying the altcoin bloodbath down 50-80% in minutes and meanwhile the Chinese Loot Theory fits because Asia was sidelined all year by US narratives like ETFs that got delayed by the government shutdown so CZ launches Aster dex luring billions in OI from noobs right before Xi provokes Trump knowing it'd tank everything and loot the overleveraged longs waiting for SOL XRP DOGE ETFs that never came and then post-crash an invisible predator like a wounded whale or carcinogenic market maker keeps dumping majors into their own shorts suppressing recovery while crypto decouples from rising stocks just like FTX Alameda in 2022 dragging on for months disguised as a bear market and Binance might've orchestrated the whole thing by exploiting their own oracle vulnerabilities to de-peg USDE and cause the cascade specifically to take out Hyperliquid as a competitor but it backfired and now they're reviewing cases case-by-case promising comps benchmarked to midnight but only for that tiny depeg window ignoring the broader manipulation and the awful human cost of traders committing suicide the next day alongside hundreds of portfolios erased including funds that won't admit it publicly and the real winners were a handful of entities pocketing billions in zero-sum derivs while retail became collateral damage in a quiet war between giants and regulators never probe because it's all ""just volatility"" not negligence or coordination and the market's still acting weird with thin books and artificial pressure like someone's unwinding massive losses by selling non-existing BTC MtGox-style and no full logs or transparency ever gets published so it all smells like a highly coordinated harvest not a market event lmao what the fuck:

They went through the same cycle NFTs did a few years back, and we have officially reached a point of no return. Trading became too efficient, and a minority extracted all the money from traders and retail without giving anything back in return.

I have been trading crypto 24/7 since late 2016, and I can't recall a darker era for this space than the Solana memecoin mania we had. It brought out the worst in people and stripped this space of its soul. It allowed first-cycle scammers to extract millions, and we made complete retards celebrities.

Every day I wake up now and don't have to watch the space glorifying morons and clowns while battling over 20 PVP clones of some racist/dead person token, I feel grateful. Grateful that we are never going back to that again and wondering how we got there in the first place.

There is no belief, conviction, or trust left. 

10/10 kind of sealed the deal - if you aren_ safe on 1.5_ leverage on a multibillion dollar coin and you can get liquidated on a scam wick, then there is no denying anymore that the system is completely broken and rigged against you.

For the last two years, traders have been getting fucked left and right by bot terminals, launchpads, thousands of devs, and braindead KOLs - and in the end, they didn_ even receive a stupid PumpFun airdrop which was part of the tokenomics. It's as if everyone decided that crypto is dying tomorrow, and this is their last chance to grab as much money as possible.

And to close this chapter, we got Solana co-founders 24/7 shilling a fake privacy coin they got for free during a pivotal time for their chain, in the same week $SOL got a staking ETF (while SOL is down 33% this month)

I don't know where we go from here, but I see no light at the end of the tunnel for the Solana ecosystem, and I'm kinda glad that we're going back to recycling DeFi narratives, maybe that sobers us up a bit.

Your memecoins aren_ coming back, and my advice is to start adapting and learning as much as you can, play around EVM ecosystem, and try to find opportunities there before others do. 

If this was your first cycle, I genuinely feel sorry for you. IMO, it can only get better from here. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but better days are coming. If you survived this, you will survive any other cycle.

2025-11-08,positive,"What I Read This Week...

1) Elon Musk_ $1 Trillion Pay Package

Tesla shareholders have approved the largest executive compensation package in corporate history: $1 trillion in stock options for Elon Musk, contingent upon hitting a series of operational and market-cap milestones.

The plan, first proposed earlier this year and modified after legal challenges to Elon_ prior 2018 pay deal, ties Elon_ earnings to twelve escalating performance tranches.

Each tranche vests only if Tesla meets both revenue and market-capitalization targets, culminating in a total company valuation of $8.5 trillion (Tesla's current market cap today sits at ~$1.45 trillion).

The package also includes metrics tied to AI, robotics, and energy deployment, such as scaling Tesla Bot production, commercial robotaxi fleets, and high-margin software subscriptions for autonomous driving within a decade:

- 20 million vehicle deliveries
- 10 million active FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions
- 1 million bots (Optimus humanoid robots) delivered
- 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation

The approval passed with over 75% of shareholder votes in favor, signalling strong alignment with the investor base and Elon_ vision to turn Tesla into an AI-powered manufacturing and energy platform pushing forward the Robotaxi, Optimus and a chip fab build out. Tesla_ board argued the package was essential to keep Musk focused on Tesla rather than his other ventures (SpaceX, xAI, and X).

The package could add significant dilution if all tranches vest with Elon_ ownership increasing from about 13% to 25%, but supporters view it as justified by the growth required to trigger a full payout.

Hitting those targets would imply Tesla generating more annual revenue than Apple and controlling a sizable portion of the emerging robotics, autonomy, and distributed energy markets.",2025-11-08 17:06:00+00:00,30.0,52.0,690.0,884.0

The public sale of MON will go live on Coinbase token sales, a new platform from Coinbase for token distribution, a week from today.

This is the very first public sale that Coinbase has hosted, and it will be made available to 80+ countries, including the United States of America.

7.5% of the total monad supply will be sold at a price of $0.025/token.

At the Monad Foundation, we think big. Over 285,000 accounts were made eligible for the MON airdrop, in an attempt to get people who eat, sleep, and breathe crypto to be the initial stakeholders of the Monad ecosystem. This public sale has the potential to extend the reach of Monad by extending the distribution of MON into the hands of millions of regular people.

This sale is attempting to fulfill crypto_ founding promise: open, fair, and inclusive finance.

Monad was built in part to onboard the general public to crypto, and provide them with the tech that is ready for mass adoption. The world is a big place, and crypto needs to grow far beyond the Crypto Twitter bubble.

Prior formats hide the public key behind a hash, so a BSQC can't easily crack it.

Do this:

1) create a new segwit wallet. It will start with ""bc1q"" (NOT ""bc1p""), you can use older formats too like ones starting with ""1"" and ""3""

2) send all your BTC into this new address

3) you can continue to stack sats into this new address

4) NEVER send BTC out of it, once you do you're BSQC hackable because your public key is revealed

5) wait for Bitcoin to upgrade to a quantum safe protocol, this may take 7 years, who knows

6) send your BTC into the new quantum safe address when the network is NOT congested, once you send, you reveal the private key for a short time. It's unlikely a BSQC will steal your coins in that short window",2025-11-11 01:04:00+00:00,195.0,365.0,2020.0,3335.0

2025-11-11,neutral,"Late to this, but as a VC, here_ my perspective on airdrop farming:

Farmers are obviously not useful to projects.

@Cobie is right that as a VC, I ignore farming activity. I_ extremely skeptical of easily farmed metrics, and we always dig into the data to try to identify farming. Wherever we see it, we heavily discount it.

Farming is, by definition, people who pretend to use a product and pretend they will be long-term users, in order to get paid via an airdrop.

Let that sink in for a second. Crypto has broken all of our brains on this. If a normal consumer startup paid people to pretend to use their product and pretend to retain, that_ be considered fraud. Airdrops started as an idealistic and egalitarian practice, but the rise of industrial farming has evolved it into something straightforwardly toxic. Farmers try to emulate real users and make it hard for teams (and investors) to identify the difference.

So, no. Farming is obviously bad for startups. If it weren_ bad, farmers wouldn_ try to hide that they're farmers.

But farmers will reply: the value of farming is that farmers pump up metrics of successful projects, and therefore, it_ good for the projects.

This is so wrong it_ hard to even know where to start.

First, if farmers are _umping up metrics, who are they pumping them up to? Who is being fooled here by inflated metrics? Is it the VCs? If so, farmers are claiming that founders are conspiring with farmers to dupe their VCs. (And on many heavily farmed projects, VCs are underwater.)

Note: this is incompatible with the theory that VCs are the primary culprit of bad token launches. Either the VCs are dastardly villains conspiring with founders to dump on retail, or they_e stupid fools being duped by founders with farmer-inflated metrics. But it can't be both at the same time.

The other option is that it_ not the VCs who are fooled--VCs see through it--it_ retail who_ being fooled. So maybe farmers are conspiring with founders to dump on retail, and that_ why it_ good for founders. The problem with this theory is that founders don_ get to dump day 1, only farmers do. So by the time the chickens come home to roost, the metrics have already plummeted, the farmers got out by selling their airdrops, and the founder is left holding the bag. Only the farmers profited from retail, not the founder.

But even if we rationally agree with this analysis, to most people, it doesn_ matter. Because we all know that despite this, all good projects get farmed. So if nobody shows up to farm your project, that must imply your project is not good, and therefore you_l do poorly in the market. Don_ you want to be like all the other good projects? So you need farmers to show up, whether you think they're parasitic or not.

This sounds convincing. But it_ totally wrong, for the age-old reason: correlation is not causation. Yes, good projects get farmed. But the project being good causes the farming, the farming doesn_ cause the project to be good. All big cities have crime, but that doesn_ mean crime is causes cities to get big. The causation is backward. You can have a good project that isn't farmed.

To tell you the truth, I think the actual dumb money here is the exchanges. Exchange listing teams reward farmed metrics more than VCs do. But the market is already correcting on this, and norms are changing. It_ just exchanges tend to be the last to notice, as they_e furthest back in the capital stack.

Now all that being said, there_ nothing morally wrong with airdrop farming. No more than there being anything wrong with running MEV bots or sniping token launches. The game is the game. As long as you_e following the rules, all is fair. So there's no reason to look down on airdrop farmers. They're strategically trying to make money with the resources they have.

But are farmers providing value to founders?

No, obviously not.

(Caveat: _inear farming is an exception--if you_e being paid to provide liquidity or an insurance backstop, or some other clear assumption of risk, I_ call that more classic liquidity mining, which is totally valuable. Or if you_e being paid to market make or provide tight spreads, that_ also valuable. This kind of farming is pay-for-performance that contributes to a product moat. But that_ not like the vibes based _retend to be a user and touch everything"" type farming I_ talking about above, which tends to be more common for L1/L2s or for consumer products.)",2025-11-11 23:08:00+00:00,461.0,103.0,1279.0,2868.0

2025-11-12,positive,"Privacy is the precondition for many of our freedoms. It_ the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy_ become a rare, vanishing commodity.

That_ why we founded Cypherpunk (@cypherpunktech)  a company dedicated to privacy and self-sovereignty. We will execute on our mission by accumulating, building, and supporting privacy-protecting assets and technologies at a time when the world needs them more than ever.

To that end, Cypherpunk  Ticker: $LPTX (today), $CYPH (tomorrow)  was launched with a $50 million+ investment from @winklevosscap to begin accumulating Zcash ($ZEC) at what we believe to be a significant discount to Zcash_ true long-term value. Cypherpunk currently holds 203,775 ZEC purchased at an average price of ~$245 per coin, representing ~1.25% of the current ZEC supply. We plan to continue accumulating ZEC rapidly so that Cypherpunk owns at least 5% of the total ZEC supply.

Since Zcash_ launch 9 years ago, we_e observed its highly symbiotic relationship with bitcoin. Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin and shares identical tokenomics  both have a fixed total supply of 21 million coins. If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash. One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We_e been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now  as we enter the age of AI  is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC.

We feel strongly that Zcash could become a meaningful percentage of Bitcoin_ market capitalization  just on the merits of it being a privacy hedge or insurance policy to Bitcoin_ transparency alone. We believe bitcoin will continue to ascend to $1,000,000 per coin over the next 5-10 years. We also believe Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well. These coins go hand in hand.

Over the next few weeks, we_l continue to lay out our thesis. In the meantime, we_e excited to have you join us as we stack zats and invest in other technologies that promote privacy and self-sovereignty. Let us proceed together apace.

Devcon, Bangkok  Nov 12, 2024. The suspense is real. The room overflows; hundreds can't get in. An ""announcement of an announcement"" had sparked wild speculation about my ""most ambitious initiative"".

Who knew the beam chain vision would evolve into lean Ethereum? Next-level ambition, seeping into all layers of L1. Snarks for consensus and execution. Fort mode and beast mode.

What's new? zkEVMs. Real-time proving. Full validation in a tab, on a phone. Let's pump L1 gas with the exponential snark curve. Starting in months, not years. To me it all points to 10K TPS, the gigagas frontier.

Dream bigger dreams for L1. Believe in something.

At a high level, we argue to double down on Glamsterdam_ L1 scaling theme and think that the bar for EIPs not focused on L1 scaling should be even higher: (1) extremely important, and/or (2) extremely simple.

On the EL side we think Repricings are a silent hero for Glamsterdam: They (1) meaningfully scale Ethereum L1, and (2) unlock the full scaling potential of both headliner EIPs.

2025-11-12,all,"Privacy is the precondition for many of our freedoms. It_ the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy_ become a rare, vanishing commodity.

That_ why we founded Cypherpunk (@cypherpunktech)  a company dedicated to privacy and self-sovereignty. We will execute on our mission by accumulating, building, and supporting privacy-protecting assets and technologies at a time when the world needs them more than ever.

To that end, Cypherpunk  Ticker: $LPTX (today), $CYPH (tomorrow)  was launched with a $50 million+ investment from @winklevosscap to begin accumulating Zcash ($ZEC) at what we believe to be a significant discount to Zcash_ true long-term value. Cypherpunk currently holds 203,775 ZEC purchased at an average price of ~$245 per coin, representing ~1.25% of the current ZEC supply. We plan to continue accumulating ZEC rapidly so that Cypherpunk owns at least 5% of the total ZEC supply.

Since Zcash_ launch 9 years ago, we_e observed its highly symbiotic relationship with bitcoin. Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin and shares identical tokenomics  both have a fixed total supply of 21 million coins. If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash. One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We_e been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now  as we enter the age of AI  is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC.

We feel strongly that Zcash could become a meaningful percentage of Bitcoin_ market capitalization  just on the merits of it being a privacy hedge or insurance policy to Bitcoin_ transparency alone. We believe bitcoin will continue to ascend to $1,000,000 per coin over the next 5-10 years. We also believe Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well. These coins go hand in hand.

Over the next few weeks, we_l continue to lay out our thesis. In the meantime, we_e excited to have you join us as we stack zats and invest in other technologies that promote privacy and self-sovereignty. Let us proceed together apace.

_ou just press the Grok icon on any _ post and it will analyze it for you and research it as much as you want.

So, just by tapping the Grok icon, you can assess whether that post is the truth, nothing but the truth, or whether there's something supplemental that needs to be explained.

So, I think we've made a lot of progress towards freedom of speech and people being able to tell whether something is false or not false, or propaganda.

The recent update to Grok is actually, I think, very good at piercing through propaganda.

And then, we used that latest version of Grok to create Grokipedia.

It's not just, I think, more neutral and more accurate than Wikipedia, but it actually has a lot more information than a Wikipedia page.

Expect a few days for TGA spending to begin to significantly add to liquidity and should persist for several months.

Obviously, QT ends in Dec and the balancesheet will crawl higher.

We should see the dollar begin to weaken again.

The next key step is to avoid a Year End funding squeeze. Expect several ""temporary"" measures to add liquidity. Term Funding and SRF operations are most likely.

That will eventually morph into the desperately needed changes to the SLR to allow banks to absorb more issuance and re-lever their balance sheets. This is a big liquidity bazooka. Expect in Q1.

2025-11-14,positive,"ELON: ONLY INTERESTING SIMULATIONS SURVIVE

_f the simulation theory is true, then it is actually very likely that the most interesting outcome is the most likely. 

Because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. 

The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're not interesting. 

In this reality that we live in, we run simulations all the time. 

When we try to figure out if the rocket's going to make it, we run thousands, sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which path is the good path for the rocket and where can it go wrong? 

Where can it fail? 

But when we do these millions of simulations of what can happen with the rocket, we ignore the ones where everything goes right, because we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. 

And for AI simulations as well, like all these things, we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. 

So, if the simulation theory is accurate, then the simulators will only continue to run the simulations that are most interesting. 

Therefore, from a Darwinian perspective, the only surviving simulations will be the most interesting ones. 

And, in order to avoid getting turned off, the only rule is that you must keep it interesting because the boring simulations will be terminated.
