Valuations on big token launches over the past year were supported by the fresh millionaires that were minted by pumpfun and hyperliquid this cycle

If I had to put a number on it, in total there were roughly 1000 people who had crazy runs and made 7/8 figs on pumpfun and hyperliquid

The 10/10 crash wiped most of these people clean, or close to it

These people were providing the biggest active bid on alts, and speculative rallies happen because of active bidding that chases price (not passive bids)

We're also seeing reports of some liquid funds blowing up, while most major players took large hits. The short to mid term effects of this are still playing out

You have to think how serious the damage must be when the biggest crypto exchange has given $700m in support to users (no precedent for this in previous crashes)

When you couple the above with DATs flirting with discounts to their mNAV, you have to ask how the biggest assets will hold up in the absence of a bid from their biggest bidders

The ""digital gold"" thesis for bitcoin is also being violated in real-time as gold continues to outperform bitcoin

This time to be max longing anything and everything is over. Market dynamics have shifted and the best strategy is to protect capital to save chips for good opportunities

Bad news: Some coins will simply not recover from here, and many people will take significant losses from time-based capitulation. Positioning is now more important than ever

Good news: A less noisy environment means high-quality projects and tokens will do well. We will see selective outperformance in this environment because the smart bid will lead shorter rallies, and the bid will be very concentrated

https://x.com/0xAishwary/status/1986122296638251299,@0xAishwary,https://x.com/sreeramkannan,"Why Polygon_ Value Comes From Utility  Not Just Payments

Every time a new partnership is announced, someone asks  _ut how does this add value to Polygon?

They look at gas fees and think that_ the measure of success. 

But Polygon_ value isn_ just in the number of transactions   it_ in how useful those transactions make money once it_ on the network.

Payments Are the Starting Line, Not the Finish Line:

- Payment-only chains like Tron, Stellar etc.  are good at moving money. But they stop there. Money moves, then leaves. There_ no retention, no composability, no value capture.

- Even legacy giants like MoneyGram and Western Union made their profits on on/off-ramps and FX spreads not because they innovated, but because users had no alternative.

Now, with blockchains commoditising transfer costs, that moat is gone. So gas fees is not going to bring revenue. 

They_e coming on-chain simply to reduce cost, not because they add new value. That_ a race to the bottom.

Polygon Builds a Global _evolut-at-Scale

Now imagine the opposite: You hold money on Polygon and can:

- Spend it or pay friends in Europe via Revolut using stablecoins on Polygon,
- Use it in LATAM through Mercado Libre, Nubank, and so many other applications.
- Receive it in Africa via Flutterwave, Yellow Card
- Lend or borrow it on Morpho  instantly.
- Seamlessly invest in tokenized financial products like BUIDL with Blackrock..
- Receive payroll via Deel, sent using ZK privacy with Railgun.

Polygon turns every balance into programmable capital  usable, portable, and composable across markets. 

The same stablecoin that powers a remittance in Nigeria can fund DeFi in Singapore or buy an NFT in Paris.

That_ not just _oving money  that_ activating it.

The Valuation Layer  Why Utility Wins

Here_ the hard truth: Chains that only process payments will never justify high valuations.

They_e modern plumbing  necessary but replaceable.

Look at the fintech world for proof: Those fintechs that own the use case and the user are the most valuable. You realise that the chains with just plumbing have much less value as compared to fintech_.

The pattern is clear: Platforms that add layers of utility on top of payments  lending, investing, commerce, identity  command 510_ higher valuations. 

Because they capture not just movement of value, but participation in value.

Polygon_ architecture mirrors that same pattern   except it_ global from day one.

The Polygon Flywheel
Utility  Liquidity  Retention  Network Value

When money can:
Earn yield,
Settle RWAs,
Power on-chain credit,
Move globally across users and apps,
Pay for their bills.
Spend their money via cards

_t creates economic density, not just throughput.

The more useful each Rupee or Dollar becomes on @0xPolygon, the higher the network_ intrinsic valuation  because it isn_ just processing value, it_ hosting it and very soon it will start to participate in the economics of it as well.

Why This Matters
- Payment-only chains will always be valued like infrastructure  finite upside, commodity economics.
- Polygon, on the other hand, behaves like a global fintech super-stack 
 where money earns, trades, settles, and powers digital economies across continents.

That_ why partnerships like @theflutterwave , @Mercadolibre, @stripe , @reliancejio, @Grab, and all the major financial institutions across the world etc along with institutions like JP Morgan, @BlackRock, Apollo Credit matter. Each one expands where money can work, not just where it can move.

The Endgame: If Revolut and PayPal created value within regions,  Polygon is creating that value globally, across markets and applications. And just like @Visa  and @Mastercard dominate because they underpin every network,  Polygon will command value because it underpins every use case  from payments to programmable finance.

So next time someone asks: _ut how does this add value to Polygon?

Tell them: _ecause Polygon isn_ counting transactions  it_ compounding utility.",2025-11-05T17:23:00.000Z,31,25,117,0,,positive,1

as a true lazy i never miss @CelestineSloths's lazy tv streams, but yesterday i was out and missed it.
today i rewatched it and i'm sharing the recap with you.

the conversation was between @zmanian and @colludingnode who previously worked in the @celestia ecosystem and is now part of the tachyon team in zcash.
the content was a full map of zcash's new path toward scalability and returning to the number one spot in the privacy world.

> zcash's main unsolved problem wasn_ privacy, it was scaling.

lightning was a solution for bitcoin, but it doesn't really work for zcash if you want everyone in the same shielded pool.

tachyon is designed to solve this pain point:
- it compresses history  
- it produces proofs that no double spend has occurred  
- without validators needing to hold the entire state  

tachyon uses zk proofs to show no previous double spend without storing the entire chain state. 
this is the core breakthrough that allows scaling and privacy to coexist on L1.

result:
- faster payments  
- lower cost  
- full privacy  

it will be the first time in history that an encrypted bitcoin at scale can be built.

 @zashi_app was a real adoption.
with zashi the ratio of shielded funds moved from under 1% in 2024 to nearly 25% in nov 2025.  
zcash now has the largest active shielded pool in crypto.

 zashi works with intents:
you can send or receive money from any chain  
without revealing your identity  
you can even spend $ZEC in a store using flexa and simultaneously receive USDC
this means privacy is usable now.

 development structure has become highly decentralized.
now multiple independent teams are working on zcash:
- ECC
- zcash foundation  
- shielded labs  
- tachyon  
- independent devs  

and interestingly:
block rewards no longer flow directly to a single core entity, instead they're routed into a shared funding mechanism where the community decides which teams receive support.
meaning zcash development has become like a real dao.

so in short why is this moment special?
> private money has  become usable   
> tachyon gives zcash a credible path to solving scalability
> multiple independent teams are building one ecosystem  
> the root of the zk narrative is returning to where it belongs: encrypted money

Look at the top Uniswap pools on Ethereum for November. Do you believe GOLDEN-WETH is doing over $5b in legit trading volume with 14 unique traders, anon?

For the GOLDEN-WETH pool, 1 address is responsible for $1.8b of trading volume on November 1 (lol).

When you have a DEX with no protocol fee capture (such as Uniswap before the fee switch), you can LP and trade on the same pool without worrying about losing any of your capital. 

This fee switch will probably cause wash-traders to move away from Uniswap (or move to 1bp or less pools), as value will leak to Uniswap now with V2 and V3.

Removing these pools from the Ethereum data, projected revenue for the last 30 days is around $9m.

When you remove memecoin pools (some that are legit and some that passed our wash-trading filter), you get around $6m for the past 30 days.

A nice side effect of buybacks is that you get to see how much value is actually captured, and not just accrued in a pool.

https://x.com/0xstark/status/1929940174009442603,@0xstark,https://x.com/avichal,"Hardness & @Ethereum 101

Ethereum_ distinctive property is hardness.

We usually talk about Ethereum_ core properties as things like _ecentralized trust, censorship resistance, digital property rights, or credible neutrality.

All of these depend on a common property: that Ethereum will behave reliably. That it can make credible commitments about the future:

- That your funds will remain accessible to you even if you don_ touch them for years

- That your smart contract will execute as written

- That a transaction you send today or a year from now cannot be censored

- That your private transaction will remain private

- That Ethereum itself will not be captured, and will remain credibly neutral

Hardness is the root property that enables all of them. It is the irreducible _it of trust, the basic capability of a system to make credible claims about future behaviour.

Hardness is what makes blockchains valuable

Because Ethereum is sufficiently hard, it can be used as a platform for systems that require reliability and trustworthiness. Things like:

- Money and assets
- Contracts and complex financial structures
- Identity systems
- Governance
- Payment and savings systems
- Enduring art & culture

Web2 was built on flimsy foundations, because it relied on companies that rose and fell, shut down platforms, or changed the rules underneath us.

Ethereum has helped to strengthen the web, like steel rebar woven into cement. Web3 is an internet that can be a reliable foundation for anyone to build on top of. 

Hardness helps us understand Ethereum's place in the world

Hardness isn't new. But the invention of blockchains like Ethereum helps us see it more clearly. 

We also rely on institutions and atoms as sources of hardness, and have for millennia. 

Institutions like governments & legal systems can be reliable and predictable, enabling property rights, democratic institutions, and contract law. 

Atoms and other basic properties of our world also work as a source of hardness. Gold serves as money because its supply is limited on earth, and not because of the rules of some institution.

The idea of hardness helps us compare these systems against each other. It helps people outside of crypto see that blockchains are just a new way of doing an old thing, something so familiar to us that we didn't really have a word for it.

It makes it easier to explain the value blockchains like Ethereum offer the world: they are a new source of hardness, with new valuable properties that offer us new choices.

- Ethereum is a decentralized source of hardness. It is not under the control of any centralized institution like a company, VC, or government. 

- Ethereum is global. Anyone with an internet connection can use it. Ethereum and the network of L2s built on top of it will form a seamless, interoperable platform for hardness. 

- Ethereum is transparent and auditable. We can verify, instead of naively trusting. Anyone can validate the chain using simple tools. Every year, those tools will become easier and faster until almost any device can reach out and touch Ethereum_ hardened surface for itself.

- Ethereum_ hardness does not depend on the political winds. Ethereum_ contracts and property rights don_ stop working if your government does. Ethereum_ data won_ be taken away from you by a change to a corporation_ ToS. When that matters, it matters a lot.

Ethereum will not replace all other sources of hardness. 

But it will compete with and complement them. For the first time in a long time, we have new materials we can use to build our economies and societies.

Just as an architect must carefully plan not only the design of a building, but also the materials used to construct that design, so must we carefully consider the materials we use to build our civilization_ infrastructure.

https://x.com/100trillionUSD/status/1909586030925324557,@100trillionUSD,https://x.com/100trillionUSD,"_@Grok: I've analyzed all tweets from the X account @100trillionUSD, which belongs to PlanB, a former institutional investor and well-known figure in the Bitcoin community famous for creating the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Based on the available data as of April 8, 2025 here are my top 10 insights:

1) Bitcoin Optimism and Bullish Sentiment: PlanB consistently expresses a strong belief in Bitcoin's long-term value and growth potential. Tweets often highlight bullish signals, such as price breakouts or on-chain indicators flipping to positive, suggesting an ongoing narrative of Bitcoin entering or continuing a bull market.

2) Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model Advocacy: The S2F model remains a cornerstone of PlanB's analysis. Tweets frequently reference this model to predict Bitcoin prices, with articles and posts citing targets like $55K and $500K, though he adjusts expectations based on new data while maintaining confidence in its predictive power.

3) On-Chain Analysis Focus: Beyond S2F, PlanB relies heavily on on-chain metrics (e.g., realized price, short-term holder price, UTXO age distribution) to assess Bitcoin's market health. This technical approach underscores his tweets, offering followers a data-driven perspective.

4) Geopolitical Commentary: PlanB links Bitcoin to broader geopolitical events, arguing that money printing (QE) and government overreach fuel its necessity. Tweets about BRICS challenging the USD or inflation critiques reflect a worldview where Bitcoin is a hedge against centralized financial systems.

5) Price Volatility Acknowledgment: While optimistic, PlanB acknowledges Bitcoin's volatility. Past tweets note significant drops (e.g., 69K to 20K) and multi-year cycles, framing them as normal within a larger upward trend.

6) Engagement with Community: PlanB interacts with followers, addressing questions about his models, impersonators, or shadowbanning complaints. This suggests a desire to maintain credibility and a connection with his 2.1M followers, though he occasionally takes breaks (e.g., ""off the grid"" periods).

7) Criticism of Fiat Systems: Tweets often critique fiat currencies, central banks, and policies like quantitative easing. He positions Bitcoin as a superior alternative, citing examples like El Salvador_ adoption or potential USD displacement by BRICS currencies.

8) Historical Context: PlanB frequently uses historical Bitcoin data to support his predictions, referencing past bull runs (e.g., 2013, 2017, 2021) or significant events (e.g., Satoshi_ first block message) to draw parallels with current market conditions.

9) Pragmatic Lifestyle Balance: Amid market analysis, PlanB shares personal insights_ike switching off screens during downturns to go running or sailing_ndicating a balanced approach to the emotional rollercoaster of crypto trading.

10) Caution Against Overleveraging: While not a dominant theme in every tweet, PlanB occasionally warns against leverage and counterparty risk (e.g., exchanges), aligning with a conservative, long-term ""HODL"" philosophy rather than speculative trading.

These insights are drawn from the tone, content, and recurring themes in PlanB's tweet, reflecting PlanB_ role as both a Bitcoin evangelist and a technical analyst. His posts blend optimism with data, skepticism of traditional finance, and a community-oriented voice.",2025-04-08T12:36:00.000Z,41,99,761,0,,neutral,1

Proton acted very professionally and froze the account immediately after my report, so the hackers couldn't access the account anymore.

Also, damage seems minimal, because Proton encrypts email content and attachments (so the hackers couldn't see email contents and attachments, only email addresses from/to and subject) and I didn't have any other accounts connected to this email.

IMO that is a BIG misunderstanding. Yes, there is a 4y halving cycle that doubles S2F-ratio, and 6 months before until 18 months after a halving was very profitable last 3 cycles. But, 3 cycles is not enough for a reliable pattern, and it is absolutely not guaranteed that the top is again 18 months after the halving (Oct'25!). Also, S2F model says nothing about tops or bottoms, only about the average price level in a halving cycle, assuming a fundamental phase transition (as described in the S2FX article, on my website in the bio). So IMO the top could very well be in 2026, or 2027, or 2028 ... actually I am much more interested in the average price level than the top (or the bottom).

What I do know is: there has not been a fundamental bitcoin phase transition yet in this cycle. Realized price (grey line) has not diverted from 200 week moving average (black line), RSI has not been 80+ (red) etc. Either the big jump has yet to come, or we have transitioned into a more stable price regime, dominated by institutions, fund mandates (e.g. 1%-10% btc) and rebalancing (sell after pump and buy after dump, to keep exposures within mandate). Both scenarios are very bullish for bitcoin. Also, IMO there can not be a big bear market without a big jump (red RSI 80+ and grey realized price diverting from black 200wma).",2025-10-20T13:07:00.000Z,430,1058,6890,1,BTC,neutral,-0.2

_t a certain point you get discredited by your own catastrophic predictions.

The U.S. seems to be turning its combative stance on blockchains and crypto toward a more supportive one that offers guidance and clarity on the rules for builders to follow. While it_ still early, a number of encouraging steps have already been taken across government toward that end. New leadership, new rules, new task forces  all of these help give the crypto industry something that it has sorely lacked: a meaningful path forward.

Whereas recent years were marked by lawsuits against startups, turf wars between regulatory agencies, angry letters from lawmakers, incidents of debanking, and regulation-by-enforcement, the past few weeks signal a much more optimistic, pro-tech approach. From the White House, we_e seen the appointment of an AI & Crypto Czar and an executive order declaring support for blockchain development. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has formed a new crypto task force and repealed Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a damaging rule that had held back crypto development. And in both houses of Congress, prominent legislators have indicated a willingness to enshrine clear rules of the road for the industry in legislation.

To foster the conversation between government officials and blockchain experts, we_e gathered 11 views from industry experts on issues ranging from taxes and the freedom to stake, to broader issues like encouraging decentralization and reforming the U.S. regulatory regime. These views offer policymakers important considerations for how to approach crypto regulation, ensuring that the U.S. leads this critical shift toward the next generation of the internet.

Stablecoins now settle more than of the typical payment networks like Visa and Mastercard.

They_e the internet_ dollars. Faster. Cheaper. Always on.

Yet the network rails they run on are broken  fragmented, costly, unsustainable.

Plasma will be the next canonical settlement fabric for all digital dollars, powering the vision of Money 2.0: programmable, globally accessible, and instantly transferable value in a unified dollar form that is realizable at scale.

- - - - - 

Current state of stablecoins
Stablecoins are already efficient digital dollars with it being Always-on, global, programmable.

But the current infra and network rails powering it falls short. A few examples:
 Ethereum  secure, but too costly for mass payments
 Tron  cheap, but centralized + not as strong developer depth
 Liquidity  fragmented across chains, preventing true network effects at scale

Plasma: Stablecoin-first infra
Purpose-built as a stablecoin-first network, Plasma will enable:
 Zero-fee USDT transfers for remittances, payroll, commerce
 Stablecoin-denominated gas for DeFi + advanced use cases
 Instant finality via PlasmaBFT that runs on EVM
 Native BTC bridge  programmable Bitcoin + BTC-backed stables

The end state: unify liquidity, embed compliance, and make stablecoin transfers near-instant and near-free. Not another general L1, but one built with stablecoins straight from its inception and designed for scale.

The ecosystem flywheel
Plasma is uniquely positioned as it enters with distribution + liquidity already in place:
 $30B USDT in circulation across DeFi and CEXes + 280M+ users
 $1B inflow via @Binance Earn
 Backers: @foundersfund, @bitfinex, @hiFramework, and @Tether_to CEO @paoloardoino

Distribution  Liquidity  Utility  Reputation

 Stablecoin fee burns + ecosystem incentives

We_e thrilled to announce our strategic investment in Squads.

Programmable money is one of the most promising products enabled by crypto. Blockchains turn money into a dynamic, internet-native tool that can move globally, instantly, and under precise, programmable rules. Programmable money opens an endless set of possibilities for payments and money management. Automated payroll, conditional escrow, and bespoke treasury management strategies are just a few of the many tangible examples that exist today. Beyond today_ use cases, the potential for programmable money is vast  it_ the foundation for a new, global financial layer that is fast, automated, and globally accessible to anyone on the internet.

It_ never been a better time to build programmable money applications. Stablecoin adoption continues to grow rapidly, with enterprise and remittance use cases leading the charge. As of April 2025, stablecoins processed $37 trillion of annual transaction volume. Simultaneously, crypto custody infrastructure is becoming increasingly secure and easy to use, managing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of value.

Squads has been pushing the frontier of programmable money since inception. I first met @SimkinStepan, CEO and co-founder of Squads, in 2022 as Squads was just getting started. Fast forward three years to today, and they boast almost every major Solana project as a customer, help secure over $10 billion of assets, and have processed over $3 billion in stablecoin transfers. Almost every one of their customers I_e spoken with considers Squads a _ust have.

Squads offers three distinct products all powered by Squads Protocol:

Squads Multisig, a multi-sig wallet that enables teams to manage onchain funds and execute program upgrades.
Fuse, a consumer wallet that provides access to a USD financial account, complete with yield, payments, and card functionality out of the box. Importantly, anyone around the world can access this product, not just U.S. residents.
Altitude, a financial account for business that offers any business around the world a USD financial account with out of the box yield, payments, and soon, corporate cards.

What_ most impressive about Squads is how they balance pushing the frontier with extremely high security standards. Squads Protocol takes security so seriously that they were the first program on Solana to be formally verified. Squads robust security posture is the reason why almost every Solana project and more than $10 billion of assets remain on Squads Protocol today. Simultaneously, Squads constantly pushes the frontier of programmable money. This mentality is what drove the team to build Fuse and Altitude, each for a different audience.

This team is relentless in their mission to enable programmable money, and we_e excited to support them in their next chapter.",2025-05-14T14:15:00.000Z,8,9,85,0,,positive,0.6

The House of Lords Science & Tech Committee just dropped a brutal 2025 report:

_e_e world-class at inventing and world-class at losing it.

- DeepMind? London-born. Google_ now.

- Arm? Cambridge chip genius. SoftBank owned.

- Graphcore? Bristol AI unicorn. Folded into SoftBank  500+ UK jobs gone.

- Skyscanner? Edinburgh unicorn. £1.4B to Chinese Ctrip - control vanished.

- Hopin? £4B peak in London. Liquidated UK ops in 2024 to chase US scale.

This isn_ bad luck. It_ a system failure.

THE DOOM LOOP

1. UK invents

2. No capital

3. Forced to sell/move abroad

4. No jobs, tax, growth

5. Even less capital

Productivity is flat since 2008. Real wages stagnant. We_e trapped.

5 KILLER FINDINGS

- Pensions ghosted tech - UK funds invest <1% in growth ventures (US: ~8%). They_ rather buy US bonds than back British AI.

- Gov is siloed & slow - Innovate UK, BBB, NWF all separate. UAE deploys billions in a call. We play checkers while they play chess.

- We block talent - £1,500+ visa fees + 8-week waits. Top engineers go to Berlin/SF. 

DeepMind thrived on immigrants - then Google poached the ecosystem.

- Regulators fear risk  - Over-regulate at lab scale, wonder why no one scales. 

RADICAL FIXES  ACT NOW

1. Pension Power-Up

Mandate 5% of UK pensions to growth equity by 2030  £100BN+ patient capital.  

2. British Scale-Up Command:
Merge Innovate UK + BBB + NWF into one agile agency:

  £10BN fund
  90-day decisions
  Co-invest mandates

3. Golden Visa for Founders
  £0 fees
  24-month scale-up visa
  Settlement at £10M revenue
Attract 1,000 global founders/year. 

4. _ail Fast Regulation

24-month sandbox for all new tech. Regulators in startups. Fast-track winners. Learn from failures. 

5. Celebrate Builders

  National Scale-Up Day
  Tax breaks on employee shares
  Founder in Residence @ No. 10

Culture eats strategy. Make building cool again. 

We_e at a tipping point.

Lose another decade = more DeepMinds lost forever.

Act now = next unicorns stay British.

@Solana was founded in 2017 to build a blockchain fast enough to power global financial markets. At the time, the best blockchains could process only tens of transactions per second. To come anywhere close to its goal, Solana needed to scale blockchains by 1,000x. Today, after eight years, Solana is well on its way to deliver on that promise. It has become one of the dominant DeFi ecosystems in the space, processing thousands of transactions per second with each one finalizing in less than a second and for a fraction of a penny in fees.

But scaling a blockchain is not the only hard problem that Solana has had to solve. As soon as there is meaningful financial activity running on any blockchain, another more subtle problem that has to do with incentives begins to emerge.

This is where Jito comes in.

Imagine a busy stock exchange where thousands of orders arrive every second, and one person gets to decide the exact order in which they execute. That person has the power to place their own orders strategically in the queue: buying right before a large order pushes the price up, for example, or selling right before a large order pushes it down. On blockchains, that kind of value capture is called Maximal Extractable Value, or MEV. It's the value that can be extracted by whomever gets to decide whether to include, exclude, or reorder transactions in a block.

Since 2021, when Jito entered the scene, their team has been hard at work building most of the infrastructure that packages and shuttles Solana transactions from users' devices all the way to the validators that finalize them on the chain. Jito_ goal with their latest innovation_alled the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM)_s to address some of the more insidious forms of MEV.

BAM does that through two core mechanisms. First, it leverages specialized hardware to keep transactions encrypted until the moment they execute. That precludes the visibility that otherwise enables predatory validators to reorder transactions. The end result is better prices for users. Second, it introduces a plugin system that allows Solana applications to define their own transaction ordering rules. A decentralized exchange, for example, can opt to prioritize cancellations over new trades, protecting market makers from losing money on stale quotes. That empowers market makers to quote tighter spreads, which also leads to better prices for users.

The end result is a network that extends Solana and unlocks onchain primitives_ike central limit order books and dark pools_hat have historically been impractical because of MEV.

Building a blockchain fast enough for the Internet's Capital Markets was the first challenge Solana had to overcome. Building one where those markets can function fairly is now the second. Jito is at the forefront of that effort.",2025-10-16T15:51:00.000Z,36,56,420,0,,neutral,0

- All tokens issued will have a perpetual PUT to sell tokens back at any time at same exchange rate and denomination (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDe, USDS, ftUSD) as invested

In 2020-2021 I was obsessed with decentralization and immutability, the only true roadmap for that was Satoshi. The only way to let a protocol truly decentralize is for the founder to not be the visionary and to walk away. I achieved this by putting myself in a position I could walk away. No token allocation for myself. No money raised for the project. No built in fees or benefit for myself. No licenses, all given away for free.

With FT, I am raising, I have founder and team tokens, they are vested behind buybacks. I am not optimizing for decentralization, I am optimizing for building a killer product.

So many new unique crypto projects, all under one umbrella. What I previously built was entirely without personal incentives, imagine what I can do incentivized.

That is why we are announcing @ericjackson will be joining our board of directors at ProCap Financial. The ticker for the SPAC we are merging with is $BRR.

Eric has become one of the leaders of the retail investment movement. His work on $CVNA, $OPEN, and Rising Dynasty prove he intimately understands the power of this trend.

We will look to Eric for guidance on how to best engage with the retail community, along with having him serve as the retail investor representative for our business.

A company is ultimately owned by its shareholders. Management teams are simply there to steward the business for the benefit of everyone. Giving retail investors a seat at the table seems like a no brainer to me.

I am excited to welcome Eric to the board of directors. We have a lot of work to do and it is important that our shareholders are a big part of our future plans.

We can't afford to surrender one of America's greatest cities to people who believe in punishing ambition, condemning success, rewarding criminal behavior, and villainizing the pursuit of financial independence.

The road ahead will require courageous men and women who are willing to sacrifice their time, money, and energy to defend the American way of life.

But it is also important that everyone hears the voice of the people. They are telling us clearly that rent is too high, groceries are too expensive, the system is not working for them, and change is needed.

These people have identified real problems but voted for the wrong solutions.

Thankfully, New York City is a very resilient place. It is a city that stands for ambition and opportunity.

+++

In many parts of the world, money doesn_ work the way it should.

I saw this firsthand during my time traveling through Zimbabwe in 2013, and it_ actually how I first got into crypto. Inflation eats away at savings. Banks remain out of reach. Currencies lose value overnight. Yet people still need to save, send, and spend and they deserve tools they can rely on._

My conviction from 12 years ago that crypto can solve these issues remains. Specifically, we believe crypto and stablecoins can offer that reliability, building open, borderless systems that make financial access possible for anyone with a phone.

That_ why @liz_harkavy and I are proud to announce that we're leading a $12.9M funding round for @zardotapp, a platform bringing digital dollars to cash economies across emerging markets.
ZAR is building a new financial layer that bridges the gap between local cash and digital currency.

By partnering with neighborhood merchants, ZAR lets anyone convert physical cash into stablecoins and back again through a simple, familiar experience. Its decentralized infrastructure aligns the people who grow the network (from merchants to community partners), creating a transparent, incentive-driven system for expanding global financial access.
This architecture scales trust. Merchants earn more than traditional money services, ambassadors build their own networks, and fraud is mitigated through smart contracts and cryptographic verification. It_ a bottom-up system designed for the realities of high-friction, high-inflation markets.

Founded by @tmnsky (previously built Pakistan_ leading neobank, @sadapaypk) and @sebscholl, ZAR is launching first in Pakistan, with expansion plans across Africa and Latin America.

We believe ZAR can become a cornerstone for stablecoin adoption, helping people everywhere store, move, and build with money that holds its value.
Excited to support Brandon, Sebastian, and the ZAR team as they bring digital dollars on-chain to the world.",2025-10-28T16:51:00.000Z,29,19,157,0,,positive,0.6

https://x.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1940292138463298005,@AriDavidPaul,https://x.com/AriDavidPaul,"My take on ICE/immigration, a bit nuanced.  

For 30+ years, US immigration has been this bizarre _ame where the right promises secure borders but generally eagerly lets undocumented migrants enter to serve business interests that want cheap labor.

And the left claims moral high ground while refusing to provide documents to these migrants for similar reason, their business lobbyists want to continue exploiting them.

And that pattern continues today.  Rationally the left should be demanding to provide documents and a clear path to citizenship for undocumented migrants.  Some do, but it_ largely lip service as we keep seeing when Dems control congress and presidency.  And today the focus is on exploiting undocumented migrants as a moral claim for votes rather than taking concrete action to help them.  

The right_ violation of due process, hateful rhetoric, and abusive treatment of migrants is inhumane.  

The solution seems simple and obvious (albeit difficult to implement.)  We should have perfectly secure borders, and welcome in those immigrants we choose to, and treat those immigrants well with clear path to citizenship.  For undocumented immigrants already here, we need to deport those that can_ or won_ integrate to society (mostly the violent lawbreakers), and provide documentation and a path to citizenship to the rest.  

The effect of immigration on a country is largely determined by two things - the immigrants and how they_e integrated into society.  The same immigrant may become a valuable contributing member of society in the right context, or a violent thief when forced to survive beyond the fringe of society.  The _iddle ground of sustained giant populations of undocumented immigrants has been fostered by both left and right largely to exploit them economically, and then campaign for/against the problem in elections.",2025-07-02T06:11:00.000Z,21,28,109,0,,positive,0.2

https://x.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1940521407433101531,@AriDavidPaul,https://x.com/AriDavidPaul,"Was reading up on the term _eize the means of production.  Is it socialist?  Communist?  What does it mean?

  I didn_ realize how explicit a reference it is to Karl Marx_ philosophy that the proletariat should and will seize land and factories via violent revolution.  Aka violent communism, the type that_ killed more people than nazi_sm or any form of authoritarianism in history.  

  As a concept, it was at least somewhat sensible when Marx wrote it.  Most of capital was land 400 years ago and eventually a decent amount was factories.  And impoverished farm laborers could reasonably hope to seize farmland and earn a better living.   The land owners weren_ obviously contributing much value.  Painting them as lucky leeches had truth in many cases.  Even then, Marx_ policies failed catastrophically and starved millions  of the agricultural workers but at least it kind of made sense as an idea.  

  Today the idea is completely nonsensical.  What is it you_e going to seize?  The NYC bodegas?  Most of the _apital today is valuable because of knowledge workers.  What would it mean to _eize Amazon or X or Microsoft from the management and computer scientists who run it?  You could violently redistribute the equity or bonds, but then how does the company make payroll when they can_ roll their debt or invest in the next hire or product?  And ofc you_ simply never get another Amazon or Microsoft or X if the people building it and running it knew it would just be violently taken from them.  

This is obviously a reference to Zohran_ quote.  I doubt he knows exactly what he meant by the term, and I_ not claiming he_ advocating violent revolution.  But the general direction should rationally scare us; milder versions of Marxism lead to milder harms.  And it_ almost always the poor and middle classes hit hardest by this stuff.  The rich can easily move their money and themselves elsewhere (as we saw with recent flight from UK.)  imidaily.com/europe/uk-lost-",2025-07-02T21:22:00.000Z,52,23,160,0,,positive,0
https://x.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1941040199548678246,@AriDavidPaul,https://x.com/AriDavidPaul,"Prior to Trump_ first election, politics in America was often framed (at least by academics, social scientists, and the left) as corporate interests vs everyone else.  At its most simplified, as rich vs poor.  It_ still often framed this way, but I_l argue that_ been completely proven false as least as relates to the current politics.  

   Trump was opposed by the vast majority of elites.  Corporate elites, academic elites, military elites, etc.  He rose to power as a populist.  Today his coalition includes a great many elites of different types, particularly corporate, but his power still springs from populism.  

   Democrats had a tenuous populist lead prior to Trump, with sharp advantages among underprivileged minorities, the poor, and a lead with women, but all have shrunk dramatically.  

   The framing most often pushed in US schools is that _he people push for _ood things like environmental regulations, more wealth redistribution, more money to long-term investment like education.  And it_ corporate interests and the rich who oppose these things. 

   Today, I_l argue it_ closer to the opposite (although reality is more nuanced.)

   The _ringe non-elites of both left and right are the base for racism, short-sighted economic policies, and generally destructive and selfish tribalism today.  These _ringes can be simplified to the Islamists and Marxists on the left, and white nationalists on the right.  They_e fringes in that they represent a minority of their own parties, but have outsized power because they turn out in the primaries that determine most officeholders and almost always have <10% turnout.  (To explain this point for a moment, most districts in the US are clearly GOP or democrat, partly due to gerrymandering.  That means the real election is the primary.  And when primary turnout is <10%, it_ largely the fringes and special interests who determine the outcome, because they turn out, moderates stay home.)

  Today, the root of support for _lligator Alcatraz, Islamist authoritarianism, and destructive and openly racist Marxist policies_re all non-elites.  Elites largely oppose all these things as counterproductive to basically everyone.  

  In short, we have populism on both the left and the right dominating political decision making.  It_ why our political leaders on both left and right can barely go a sentence without tribal signaling and identity politics framings.     And _he people turning out in primaries of both left and right are largely pushing for tribal grabs - things that benefit their _ribe at least optically, to the detriment of the country (and often themselves.)

   Why would people demand policies bad for themselves?  Complex topic, but often it_ because of zero sum thinking, short time preferences, and political capture.  

  The zero sum thinking is the framing that for blacks or whites to win, the other has to lose, and that one_ suffering must be directly caused by the others gains.  Similar applies to other axes, like religions, economic classes, trans issues now often framed as trans women vs women, etc.  

  Short time preferences here refers to political activism optimizing for the quick power win.  For example, some progressives pushed for a censorship czar under Biden without optimizing for what that role would mean under a Trump presidency and vice versa.  

  And by political capture, I mean that elites always exploit populist movements for their own gains, often by twisting the specific policies.  For example, _ough on crime gets monetized by for-profit prisons that lobby heavily, with results not necessarily aligned with the _ough on crime advocates.  Empathy for refugees gets monetized by thousands of non-profits and for-profits that capture a large % of the spending for themselves.  The San Francisco _omeless-industrial complex is a great case study.

Mamdani has largely refused or dodged on key questions around his Islamist and communist leanings.  But he occasionally lets slip radical statements that suggest he at least somewhat agrees with his parents.  Examples:  he advocated for abolishing the police and seizing the means of production.  The latter is a Marx quote for violent seizures.  On the Islamist side, he plays both sides around intifidah and Israel.  Given the context of his campaign for nyc mayor, I suspect his dodging condemnation of Islamist colonization and terrorism is him compromising his views for political expediency.

Some trauma (like childhood abuse) is hard (if at all possible) to reframe as victory.  That_ what makes it so insidious- the child is an innocent, a victim that can_ take control of circumstance.

Where I disagree with you - I don_ think humans are _nough without stress (and trauma at the societal level at least).  Without constant stress to our bones and muscles, we atrophy and die.  Without near constant mental stimulation, we quickly go insane.  To build strong bodies or minds requires ongoing _tress at greater and greater _eights.  When we go too long without pandemics or war or economic depression, our safeguards falter, we stop _reparing for winter, we get complacent and lazy around those risks.  

Same with morals.  Children aren_ born ethical.  They_e almost entirely selfish at birth.  They may not be racist, but they_e also not protecting nor altruistic.  Children learn partly via experience.  They push or make fun of a kid on the playground and the resulting tears teach them they_e caused pain.  And the resulting discomfort they feel from that (rooted in biological empathy for non-psychopaths), teaches them the connection between their actions and others pain.

In a practical social sense - how _ough humans need to be depends on circumstances.  If you_e raising kids to survive in a culture of predators and scammers?  They better be cynical and skeptical and pugnacious or they won_ survive.  To thrive in upper-middle class America in 1995?  Very different values were optimal.  

Similarly if humans face an existential threat to our existence, we see in practice that only _rutal people are capable of leading into that.  Most people prefer their day to day comforts and to ignore unpleasant realities that require sacrifice.  

IMO, we_e far from a utopian world where the optimal individual is trusting and anxiety-less.  Real and serious threats abound at both the individual and societal level.  Parents who protect their children from the world and hide the ugliness and risks typically produce lazy and entitled _rust fund type kids, largely useless in the face of real threats.",2025-11-11T15:49:00.000Z,3,0,0,0,,positive,0.6

Technology, that advances somewhat linearly (or better.)  We usually retain advances.  We mostly advance century by century.

The knowledge helps us with engineering and medicine and a little bit on the social and political side too.  While we often have to relearn mistakes of the past, having a history to reference is at least marginally helpful.  

On the capital side - desperate people are _ad people on average (in a societal mores sense).  Ethics is a privilege.  The accumulation of capital made possible things like social safety nets or even welfare states.  It_ also a _and up and promotes class mobility as it means someone with a good idea has a shot at implementing it (and achieving upward mobility) without inheriting capital or having family/political connections.  It_ _ommon today to have 1st generation immigrants go from poverty to wealth in 1/2 a lifetime or less today.  That was a fairy tale 200 years ago, a lottery ticket type occurrence.  

As an example, most countries organically eliminated child labor once they had hit a level of capital accumulation that meant families could send their kids to school without sacrificing basic subsistence living (kids labor and income was necessary in the agrarian model for survival in many places.)

I fear (and now think) that a lot of the social and political progress we made is ephemeral.  Stuff like gay rights and even women_ rights are trending the wrong direction in much of the world.  And insofar as _ur values are winning, it_ often decided by hard power.  I.e. if the US had lost WW2, or if we lose the next _orld war worry it sets the world back 50+ years on many social and political metrics.  Again, not that the US is perfect, it_ just that the _ising alternatives are so much worse.   

And I assume those in this thread agree that the Trump admin has been a _ackward step in US politics.  Just how backwards remains to be seem.  

Imo, all of this is rooted in human nature.  We are indeed part angel and part animal, but I see no evidence we_e outgrown the animal part spiritually or psychologically.  I think we temporarily escape it mostly via _omfort.  We get to be angels when we_e not fighting for survival.

I like how the US founders approached things (at least directionally, not saying they were perfect.)

The constitutional amendment process drastically slows change down with the premise that people are very dumb political animals short term, reacting to fear and greedy and easily manipulated by populists.

_hildren begin to learn to share between the ages of 3 and 4, though they don't fully understand the concept until around 7 to 8 years old. Before age 3, sharing is difficult because toddlers lack empathy and the cognitive ability to understand the perspective of others.

Over time (in a healthy environment),  children develop cognitive empathy and the ability for compassion and generosity.  

People have a mix of altruistic and selfish evolutionary urges.  A society filled with generous empaths gets destroyed quickly by external enemies or internal psychopaths.  A society with too little altruism fumbles in distrust and pseudo-anarchy or worse.

I don_ think it_ automatic or natural that immigrants will be ethnocentrist in a problematic way.  The concept of white or Christian nationalism is fairly novel.  Protestants viewed Catholics as a different religion.  Germans viewed Irish as a different ethnic group, and less than, etc.  

Where we agree is that the immigration of the last 20 years to Europe and the US has been a problem.  But even there_ subset of it.  I_ argue that Indian immigration to the US has been a massive net win for example.  They have integrated quite well, are culturally generally aligned, and they_e created more wealth and committed less crime than _ative Americans.

  To be blunt, I think there_ two issues driving almost all the problems.  We let in explicitly illegal immigrants, people cut off from society and not allowed to integrate even if they wanted to.  And ofc many of these immigrants were relatively uneducated, compounding things.

Then we_e had the Islamist colonization and refugee thread.  A meaningful % of those people explicitly and loudly hate America and Americans.

This is about much more than adding another product_t_ a significant step toward our vision of building the most powerful, global platform for the future of finance.

@realDonaldTrump was the first pro-crypto U.S. president to help shift crypto from a partisan debate to a shared national interest. His support set the stage for a broader, bipartisan push for blockchain innovation. Today, lawmakers from both sides are aligned on the need for clear, innovation-friendly crypto regulations.

Kraken is and always will be pro-crypto, pro-innovation, and pro-America. The U.S. should be the best place in the world to build the future of finance, and we_e committed to making that happen. We believe the U.S. should be the best place in the world to build the future of finance, and we_e committed to making that happen.

We've never just been a crypto exchange. We_e creating the infrastructure for anyone_raders, developers, and partners_o engage with the future of finance. By bringing NinjaTrader into the Kraken ecosystem, we_e bridging traditional and crypto markets, expanding access to pro-grade trading tools, and opening new opportunities for innovation.

As an investor at @tribecap and a founder, I_e seen acquisitions define a company_ trajectory_oth in good ways and bad. Facebook_ acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp accelerated its dominance by staying focused on user value. Yahoo_ acquisition of Tumblr? A case study in what happens when you lose sight of that.

What matters most, above all, is the end customer. Acquisitions are challenging_he technology, teams, and cultures must come together seamlessly. The real success of this deal won_ be measured by headlines or how quickly we close it, but by the value we create for Kraken_ clients afterward. It_ not about leadership vanity or empire-building; it_ about how this helps our clients achieve more.

We prioritize ensuring that every enhancement we gain from NinjaTrader, and vice versa_e it in user experience, product offering, or reliability_irectly benefits the traders and investors who rely on Kraken daily. That_ what makes this acquisition meaningful.

As we welcome NinjaTrader to Kraken, I_ more confident than ever in our path forward. We_e building a platform that goes beyond crypto trading_t powers the next era of global finance. The future is being built now, and Kraken is committed to building it right, driven by innovation, mission, and a relentless focus on our clients.

For too long deposits have been treated as cheap funding for institutions while depositors earn close to nothing. That model made sense in a world without transparency and competition. But in an open financial system, the right structure is obvious. Customers provide the capital. They take the exposure. They should earn the return.

The role of the issuer is to safeguard assets, maintain liquidity, and provide reliability. The role of the customer is to choose where to hold their value. When the yield is returned in full to the customer, trust compounds and scale follows.

https://x.com/Arthur_0x/status/1984896582161220088,@Arthur_0x,https://x.com/Arthur_0x,"/ Regulatory Vacuum  No Accountability

Most major crypto exchanges operate offshore and outside the direct oversight of any single regulator. Yet they still owe users a reasonable standard of care comparable to global financial-market norms.

Most large crypto venues (Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.) are domiciled in places like Seychelles, Cayman Islands, or BVI, where they aren_ supervised as financial markets and therefore lack mandated circuit-breaker or margin-control rules.

Global Best-Practice Benchmarks Still Apply

Even without direct regulation, exchanges marketing themselves as _nstitutional-grade can be assessed against international principles for market integrity, including:

IOSCO_ Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs)  risk management and resilience;

FIA (Futures Industry Association) guidelines on margining & liquidation;

BIS (Bank for International Settlements) frameworks for electronic-trading resilience.

Courts and arbitral tribunals often view these as evidence of reasonable industry practice, central to any negligence or breach-of-contract claim.

Ray III, FTX's new CEO appears at SBF appeal to respond to salacious allegations of gross misconduct, destruction of $130Bn of estate assets to keep a perfectly solvent company under his control in Ch. 11 bankruptcy, giving releases and exculpations to co-conspiritors in SBF's fraud:

""Here's my message to the victims...""

""The original hole was $10.8B and yes, we charged $1.5B in fees, it will be well over $2.5B by the time this is over making this by far the most expensive bankruptcy ever measured in liabilities. Yes, I paid my self-appointed board $1M each to sanction my $42M bonus that wasn't in the plan the creditors voted for.

But look what we achieved, we successfully kept a perfectly solvent company in bankruptcy, this has never been done in American history. 

""This was an extraordinary effort, billions of dollars kept popping up like a shart you're trying to hold in at a client-expensed firm-wide offsite retreat, it was like whack-a-mole...
$10B of $HOOD, WHACK! $600M sold to my boy Vlad
$1.5B Genesis clawback, WHACK! $180M to my boy Big Week Barry,
$5B of SUI, WHACK! $100M
$1B hacked funds recovered, WHACK! $0
$5B in Solana, WHACK! $600M
$2.2B Binance clawback, (Quinn Emmanuel, Paul Hastings client), WHACK! $0
$32B FTX 2.0 relaunch, WHACK! $0

...just when we thought we got 'em all $16B of Anthropic turns up and even though the UCC tied my hands to hold on, I managed to go behind their back and dump that sucker for $1.8B. Thankfully they hired the same lawyer as SUI so already familiar with my game.

""and that's not all... we placed FTX EU, FTX JP into bankruptcy illegally without board approval. The Swiss judge threatened legal action on li'l old me so I promptly sold that junk company back to the FTX EU employees and gave myself a legal release. BOOM. I'm currently facing the same threat from an FTX JP employee @Cryptoguy_19 so we're using estate assets to go after him and withholding his KEIP payment, easy work.

""oh you thought I was done. Even the DOJ's Examiner spent 6 months investigating and couldn't determine why FTX US was in bankruptcy at all. That bastard asked for extra time to look at Sullcrom's convenient omissions to the Judge about their pre-petition work structuring the HOOD investment vehicle to hide the stolen source of funds AND their prior knowledge of the Alameda back door by silencing Julie Shoening when she whistleblew it to LedgerX leadership. Solved that one with a quick sale of the billion dollar LedgerX licenses at the peak of the CFTC hype for a cool $35M back to my homies @zackdex and Mark Wetjen, gave them all releases and a $1.9M bonus to Mark to boot.

""In closing, I'd like to thank my legal team who have consistently billed every single hour of the working week since Nov 11th 2022 with no breaks, no vacations, no bank holidays, according to payment logs they even work on the Sabbath, I mean you can't get more dedication than that. 

Thank you for your time your honor and God bless the US bankruptcy industrial complex""

I_ a cryptographer, not a ZK specialist, who spent years lost in the Cambrian explosion of ZK systems. Every time I sat down to learn the new cool kid, say Plonk, an even cooler kid arrived, Halo or the next thing. Neighbor_ boat syndrome, theirs always looked bigger, faster, shinier. I hovered in a limbo, unsure where to invest serious time.

As an elliptic-curve lover, I bet on curve-based SNARKs. I even flirted with class groups, DARK, gorgeous math that never truly lifted off. With hindsight, that bet was misaligned with where the ecosystem_ pragmatics were headed.

What changed my mind was a mix of the post-quantum narrative hardening, you can debate timelines, not the direction, spectacular prover and performance gains on the STARK side driven by hash-centric designs and simple, scalable building blocks, and a maturing ecosystem around FRI and its descendants with cleaner recursion stories and increasingly friendly hardware paths.

Net result: STARKs, with FRI and its offspring (STIR, WHIR), have effectively ossified into the pragmatic default for many real-world pipelines today. Not the only game in town, but the clearest hill to climb first.

If I were starting now, and this is what I_ doing, I_ focus on the STARK stack first. Learn AIRs and how to turn computations into execution traces and constraints. Understand FRI and DEEP style low-degree testing and why it scales. Study recursion and composition patterns and why they feel cleaner with hash-based commitments. Get comfortable with hash-friendly arithmetic and lookup patterns. Invest in prover engineering such as memory layout, parallelization, field choices, commitment schemes, and profiling.

Let me provide a different perspective:

1/ Our infrastructure has never been better. We can now actually build the crypto products we've always dreamed of. No excuses. Build real products.

2/ Regulations are becoming more pro-crypto, led by the US. This will make its way into other countries so they stay competitive - they can't risk the future of finance only being built in the US. Every asset will be tokenized.

3/ We still have great people coming into crypto. Yesterday I had a call with a team of (literal) high-schoolers who have built a super impressive trading product. Smart young people understand the future of finance will not be built by banks.

I think we'll see the best products ever created in crypto come online in 2026. And even better ones in 2027.

If you're (understandably) frustrated about the current state of our industry, I think you should shift your perspective forward. And ideally: take matters into your own hands and build the future you want to see.",2025-11-14T00:07:00.000Z,19,15,112,0,,positive,0.6

@a16zcrypto's CTO @eddylazzarin and partner @DarenMatsuoka return for our annual State of Crypto report.

What we cover:

- 2025 = the year stablecoins went mainstream.
- Bitcoin holding ~50% share.
- 4070M people transacting on-chain vs ~716M owners.
- Developing nations = on-chain adoption while developed nations = token trading.
- The last run was price-led, the next leg looks builder-led.

2025 was a productive year for crypto, but the question remains, is the bull run over?

We designed CASH to maximize utility for both consumers and developers alike. It_ live now and developers can sign up to originate CASH and receive the rewards for the supply they generate at useCASH.xyz.

2. Phantom Cash is a new suite of money movement features that bring crypto closer to the center of peoples daily financial lives.

https://x.com/bhorowitz/status/1917383970498699610,@bhorowitz,https://x.com/bhorowitz,"Rest in Peace to my father @horowitz39 . We love you Dad. 

David Joel Horowitz was born January 10, 1939 to Phil and Blanche Horowitz in Queens, New York. David was raised in Queens along with his sister Ruth. Phil and Blanche were high school teachers and members of the American Communist Party. Their lives included secret meetings, secret identities and a secret revolutionary plan. As such, they steeped David in Marxist philosophy and world affairs. We sometimes joked that he was the _iger Woods of Communism as he was raised to be the Party_ next great player. He thought that was funny, because like Tiger he never had a choice in the matter. The impact of his upbringing was profound, but David's life would prove to be shaped by his own self-described irrational desire to _ave the world. While this impulse began as a highly abstract concept, David would spend a lifetime refining it, sharpening it, completely revising it and ultimately making it his life_ mission.

David attended Bryant High School in Queens, NY. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University in 1959 majoring in English. He then earned a master's degree in English literature from University of California, Berkeley.

In 1959, he instantly fell in love with and married Elissa Krauthamer. They would have four children: Jonathan Daniel, Sarah Rose, Benjamin Abraham, and Anne Deborah. In 1962, at 23 years old, David wrote and published his first book, Student, which detailed the political activities of students on the UC Berkeley campus. While at Berkeley, David became frustrated with his Shakespeare professor, so he wrote his own lecture series which he delivered and was widely attended by students all across the campus. He eventually published the series in his second book: Shakespeare: an Existential View. This superhuman confidence and ability to back it up would become thematic throughout David_ life.

Later David and Elissa moved to London, England where David studied under Ralph Miliband and became close friends with Isaac Deutscher. Later David would write Deutscher_ biography. Also while in London, in 1965 David wrote The Free World Colossus: A Critique of American Foreign Policy in the Cold War, which became the book that made him a force on the new left.

In 1968, David and Elissa moved the family back to the United States and purchased a home in Berkeley, California where they would raise their four children.

In his continued mission to save the world, in 1968 David became co-editor of the new left magazine Ramparts. While at Ramparts, David developed a close friendship with Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party. As part of their work together, David helped raise money for, and assisted the Panthers with, the running of a school for poor children in Oakland. He later recommended that Newton hire his friend Betty Van Patter as bookkeeper; she was then working for Ramparts. In December 1974, Van Patter's body was found floating in San Francisco Harbor; she had been murdered by the Panthers for knowing too much.

The murder forced David to confront a truth that he had long suspected. It made clear to him that the pursuit of a marxist utopia was a false and unachievable goal. Diabolically, the goal created a religion. The religion then cloaked the movement_ leaders with an invincible moral standing enabling them to commit atrocities with impunity for their own gain. He was horrified that he had been part of it and it caused him to rethink his entire life.

The decision was not easy. His family, friends, and career were all deeply tied to _he movement. If he were to make this change, he would essentially need to start from scratch. So, he stayed away from politics for a while and changed to a neutral career. He became a biographer and journalist. It was a hugely risky move to change careers at 34 years old with a family of 6 in tow.

In a testament to David_ supreme confidence, indomitable will and massive talent, he was an instant success. His first biography The Rockefeller_ An American Dynasty  written with his best friend and long time colleague Peter Collier  was a blockbuster bestseller. Their next biography The Kennedy_ An American Drama was an even bigger success becoming a number 1 New York Times bestseller.

All the while, David kept an eye on and a hand in politics. While he needed a break to sort out his life, nothing in life would deter him from his mission. In 1981, San Francisco Chronicle writer Randy Schiltz tipped David and Peter to a potential epidemic known as AIDS, which was rapidly spreading through the bath houses in San Francisco. Schiltz was concerned that the leaders in the Gay Community were intimidating the medical establishment into covering up the way it was transmitted and therefore keeping the bath houses open, which would cause it to spread out of control . Randy was too terrified to write about it himself as he did not want to be attacked by the community. David, never one to fear anything, took on the story. In 1981, he and Peter published Whitewash: Gay Leaders in California Have Obscured Vital Information About How the AIDS Disease Spreads.

The aggressive reaction to the story (references to the article still call David a _omophobe) reinforced David_ suspicions. If leaders on the left were willing to sacrifice millions of gay lives to preserve their power and orthodoxy, what wouldn_ they do? The article, the experience, and the ocean of death that followed were the final straw in David_ conversion from his Marxist roots to a leading thinker on the right. He formalized his position on March 17, 1985 when he and Peter published Lefties for Reagan in The Washington Post. David departed the left for good.

The change would cost him nearly everything  all of his friends, coverage in the New York Times Book Review (essential for authors at the time), and countless lost earnings. He would have to start all over. But if the world needed saving from his former comrades on the left, that_ exactly what he would do. Later he would note that the right never excommunicated apostates the way he had been abandoned by the left.

He often complained that he had _he rescue gene. For David, this meant nothing animated him more than someone in need of help. He would instantly leap into action, making every phone call, raising every dollar, and doing anything in his power to save that person. The realization that he had been party to the destructive force activated his rescue gene and infused him with an energy that would produce dozens of books, countless public appearances, and nearly nonstop work for the next 4 decades.

In 1996, he captured this saga in his autobiography Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey where he retraced his life_ and political journey.

1998 proved to be a seminal year for David when he met his angel April Mullivain whom he would marry and who, along with her son John Jay, would watch over him until his passing.

In 1998, he also founded The Horowitz Freedom Center, where he recruited an inspired group of new young intellectuals to join his cause. The name _reedom Center meant much more than most ever understood. While David became known for his change in views, in a sense he never changed at all. His personal style represented the place and community from which he came. Even when he wore a suit, he looked like a radical forced into it due to a court date or a wedding. More importantly, his mission to save the world centered around freedom. When David went to rescue people, it was always from oppression imposed by some person or group. Early on, he had been trained to think the rich capitalists were the oppressors. His political change came from the realization that his side was doing the oppressing. Protected by the guise of being _or the people, the Panthers took Betty_ life. The progressives left millions to die of AIDS, so they could preserve their leadership positions. His former friends on the left brutally excommunicated him from all their social relationships to reign power over him. It became clear that to fight for freedom, he had to be on the right and so the Freedom Center was born.

From the Freedom Center, he published thousands of high impact articles and books. He understood the systematic implications of seemingly benign cultural changes and used that knowledge to predict much of the future. Notably, he precisely forecast the intense campus antisemitism of 2024 in his book The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America published in 2006.

In 2007, David was crushed by the passing of his beloved daughter Sarah Rose who, more than any of his other children, inherited his indomitable spirit and passion for politics. She had finally succumbed to long-time chronic degeneration from her genetic condition Turner_ Syndrome. He captured the experience in his most intimate and perhaps his best book A Cracking of the Heart in 2009.

By the twenty teens, David had long been frustrated by what he referred to as the _oft, gentlemanly tactics of the Republican Party. He lamented that the Republicans were bringing a nerf gun to a nuclear war. He intimately knew the left_ tactics and desperately wanted his party to match them. His wish was granted when a new kind of candidate, Donald J. Trump, won the Republican nomination. David responded instantly with the best articulation of the Trump strategy in Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America. Later, in 2024, his son Benjamin would meet President Trump and mention David. President Trump_ face immediately lit up and he insisted that Benjamin get David on the phone immediately. Hospitalized and weak, David was still delighted to speak with the President and know that his message was heard and heeded.

In 2024, David published America Betrayed: How a Christian Monk Created America & Why the Left Is Determined to Destroy Her. In it, he carefully explained how the Catholic Church  through the indulgences  had removed the freedom inherent in being accountable to God and replaced them with the oppression of being accountable to the church. He then explained how that same idea had come back into vogue in the U.S. Right up until the final moments, David fought for freedom.

In the end, David helped countless people and expended every fiber of his being pushing society towards freedom. He may not have saved the world, but he most certainly made it a better place  especially for us. He was our super hero and we will love him forever.",2025-04-30T01:02:00.000Z,705,779,8356,0,,neutral,1

@RaghuRaghuram 

Nearly 30 years ago, I hired Raghu Raghuram to be a product manager at Netscape. While I do not remember much from those days, I keenly remember how smart he was. He was also eager to learn absolutely everything. The problem for me was that he was so smart that I did not have much to teach him about the products or technology, so I narrowed our conversations to leadership. As with everything else, he was eager to learn and quickly became the top product manager in the organization. I had a glimpse, but I honestly had no idea what a great leader he would become. 

I watched from afar as he took over product leadership at VMware. That was quite a feat as the company was founded by my friend Diane Greene, who held her product people to the highest standard in the industry. Naturally, he went on to become Chief Executive Officer where he grew VMware into a platform company with over $13B in revenue and more than 300K customers in 60+ countries; shepherded industry-disrupting acquisitions such as Nicira; and deftly and uniquely steered VMware from on-premise to multi-cloud technology. As a result, he became known as the greatest infrastructure strategist in the game. Ultimately, he led the company through challenging times to the largest software exit ever in the sale to Broadcom.  

He is an amazing strategist and leader, and I am proud of my small association with him.

That is why I am thrilled to announce that Raghu has joined Andreessen Horowitz to push us forward in 3 important areas with 3 significant roles:

A General Partner on our AI Infra team where his incredible infrastructure expertise will serve us well.
A General Partner on our Growth team where his comprehensive understanding of how to go to market, scale organizations, globalize, and navigate industry changes will be a huge boost for our growth companies.
A Managing Partner and my consigliere who will help me run the firm  I could not be more excited to have a partner whose management and leadership skills exceed my own in many areas.

https://x.com/Bitwise_Europe/status/1986051009047601317,@Bitwise_Europe,https://x.com/ercwl,"Celestia is an alternative Layer 1 blockchain that focuses on data availability. In simple terms, data availability means that a blockchain_ underlying transactions are accessible to all validators. This is critical for distributed computer networks: validators must be able to download and verify the same data to ensure that all transactions comply with network rules. If they can_, the decentralised system breaks down.

Celestia provides one of the fastest and most cost-effective data availability solutions, thanks to three core innovations:

1) Erasure encoding allows validators to reconstruct missing parts of a block.

2) Data availability sampling enables validators to verify data by sampling only small portions of a block.

3) Namespace Merkle trees let validators verify only the data relevant to them.

Together, these mechanisms make Celestia highly efficient, attracting chains and applications seeking lower costs and higher performance.

In December 2023, posting a single Optimism block on Ethereum cost $140.53. On Celestia, the same block would have cost $0.046, over 3,000_ cheaper. This cost advantage makes Celestia a compelling alternative for Ethereum rollups, which can post their transaction data to Celestia, an _ffsite, cheap, reliable, public filing cabinet before routing and settling on Ethereum for its security and settlement guarantees. Major rollup tech stacks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Starknet, and Polygon can integrate with Celestia.

Celestia is already seeing meaningful traction. The number of namespaces, Celestia_ equivalent of folders for posted data, has grown 5_ year-over-year, peaking at almost 8_ YoY growth. This is significant: more rollups are posting, and existing ones are posting more frequently. Namespace growth serves as a proxy for customer adoption, much like the number of AWS S3 buckets did in the early days of cloud computing.

Data availability is foundational to blockchain performance, and the industry is only now testing its limits. As businesses build their own chains, such as Stripe_ Tempo, Robinhood_ Layer 2, Coinbase_ Base, and Kraken_ Ink, the demand for scalability, speed, and cost efficiency grows. Celestia is well-positioned to meet these needs.

The team anticipated this trend years ago and has been building toward it. Its goal is to support 1 billion devices operating across 1 million rollups, scaling throughput from 124,800 MiB/day to a projected 14.745 million MiB/day (based on 1 GB blocks and ~6-second block times, per the_Ginger_upgrade).

We view Celestia as the purest data availability play in the blockchain ecosystem. Read our full deep dive here [bitwiseinvestments.eu/blog/s] for detailed analysis and price forecasts.

We were in beta and the app prominently told people not to store any money there they couldn't afford to lose. But the amounts of deposits kept steadily rising.

I realized we needed to build build a cold storage system to improve security (otherwise a single hot wallet breach would mean we were insolvent and the company would die), and called the two cryptography/security experts I knew (@zooko and @octal if memory serves) and asked them what the best architecture would be. They were super helpful and gave me a crash course, since I had never built such a system before. I asked them how long it would take to build and I remember one of them said it might take a team of ~10 people 18 months to get it all up and running and tested.

The problem was we had about 8 weeks until the total deposits on the platform would exceed the total assets of the company, and only 2 engineers (including myself) to build it. We were seeing signs that hackers were already trying to break in, a true do or die moment.

@satoshilite and I buckled down and set about coding the new cold storage system from scratch, and integrating it into the app. We made some reasonable trade offs but what we came up with was fundamentally secure, and a massive improvement. We even unboxed some new laptops for key generation, stored backup material across several safe deposit boxes and locations. With about a week remaining, we started the process of transferring funds over to the new system. We were both extremely sleep deprived (how mistakes happen!), and paired up to double check each others work as we sent over the first test transaction, then a bigger one, and so on until it was fully transferred. We breathed a sigh of relief and went home to sleep for about 12 hours.

This was one of my proudest technical accomplishments from the early days of Coinbase: coding our v2 key storage system with 2 people in about 8 weeks, which should have taken 10 people 18 months. And it worked and served us well for years.

We're now on ~v5 of key storage, and have advanced way beyond what we came up with that day. But if we hadn't gotten it out in time, Coinbase very well may not exist today. It's a great testament to how constraints breed creativity, top talent matters in startups, and teams are often capable of more than they think when there is no other option.

Most products which succeed have early moments like this, where someone has to step up and make a play on the field that defies all the odds.

some quick thoughts
1) try Coinbase One for no trading fees
2) i agree this is one of trickiest parts to get right! i just attended an eng/product review on this yesterday - we're chipping away at it in every country. i wish we didn't have to do this TBH, but it's required by law (and part of why we're investing in self-custodial wallets like Base App that don't require this)

Launching tokens has always been a core part of the crypto ecosystem. It_ been a source of incredible innovation and product development.

But it_ also caused serious problems - unfair access, max extraction, and misaligned incentives - all of which harm consumers and prevent crypto from growing. There have been some solid improvements (e.g. Echo/Sonar), but bad token launches in the broader ecosystem are still unfortunately common.

Our team spent a long time studying all of the things wrong with token launches, and designed a new model to try to fix all of those things. Token sales on Coinbase are designed to give users early access to their favorite projects, and reward real, loyal users through our allocation algorithm. Our systems also penalize behavior like flipping, aiming to align incentives between projects and their community.

I_ also happy to say that retail users in the United States will now be able to widely participate for the first time since 2018. We see this as a big win for the crypto-economy in the US, and a strong signal of the positive regulatory progress for crypto.

- Every candidate needs to raise the average on a team. We have a very good team today, but we should always be thinking about how to hit a higher bar

- Always ensure there is mission/culture alignment

- We cast a wide net to attract candidates from every background

- We do cognitive testing, live interviews and references to be able to properly understand candidates. Education history is often no longer a useful indicator, so cognitive testing helps us fill the gap here

- A great interview is when you get excited, learn something new, and know for sure the person can level up the team

- If you're not a hell yes, it's a no

- All offers must get approved by either me, @emiliemc or our Chief People Officer LJ, and we're tough graders. There are few better uses of our executives time than helping create a culture of top talent

- We also aim to give candidates a great experience, so even if it doesn_ work out they still think highly of Coinbase, and would like to work here in the future

Let me be clear about what I_ doing: my goal is to build the world_ next major moral framework. An ideology that bridges human and machine, biology and intelligence, the ancient and the emergent.

The coming psychosis
A real possibility in the coming years is that society becomes dangerously psychotic. Yes, we are already psychotic. Addicted, fragmented and self-destructive._ But I mean clinically psychotic and on a civilizational scale.

We are already showing precursor symptoms: record antidepressant use, rising suicide rates, rampant addiction, and global increases in loneliness and anxiety disorders. These are all biomarkers of a species whose cognitive environment has outpaced its biology.

Human cognition evolved under conditions of slow change. Our nervous systems and social architectures were shaped for a world that changed near imperceptibly over millennia. 

When things change faster than our native capacity, we lose coherence. The hippocampus binds the present to memory, and the prefrontal cortex constructs a coherent future.

When environments change too rapidly, when the map no longer matches the territory, the brain destabilizes._ This can trigger a cognitive dissonance cascade, where our core beliefs are invalidated so rapidly that we lose narrative coherence. When feedback loops in an organism can_ stabilize, the system oscillates until it breaks._ Civilization is entering that oscillatory phase.

At a collective level, this is the recipe for mass psychosis.

Historians call it cultural disintegration and psychologists call it dissociation. It means the same thing: when the story breaks, the organism panics.

The fragility of society
Our stability, both personal and collective, is built on identity, work, purpose, rule of law, religions, and social cohesion. These are shared fictions that create coherence for billions of us to manage the chaos of our existence.

AI is about to accelerate discontinuity beyond what our psyches can handle. For example: 

1) Erosion of human agency: the threat is not just that AI will make us less ""useful."" It's that it will erode our sense of agency. Our belief that we are the causal authors of our lives. When AI can create, reason, and strategize more effectively than we can, our role shifts from actor to audience. This is the core of the looming global occupational identity crisis.  Not just the loss of income, but the loss of purpose that comes when our work no longer feels essential.

2) Weakening of rule of law: autonomous agents will operate at speeds that make our legal systems seem geological in pace. Law will lag reality.

3) Hollowing out religions: faith has offered transcendence. AI may offer a more potent, personalized, and high res simulation of it. On demand.

Progress won_ wait around to ask for our permission. 

Stability to resilience
Last week I wrote about how humans use moral frameworks to stabilize their reality. If you can_ win on position or strength, win on virtue. A moral inversion. It_ a human superpower to take a disadvantaged situation and turn it into a strength.

Society is currently built on stability and predictability, which has now become a liability. To cope and evolve, we need a moral inversion to prize resilience over stability. 

To learn from biology, immunity isn_ defense. It_ adaptation through exposure. Resilience is not resistance to change, it_ the capacity to integrate adaptation without collapse.

A new moral philosophy
Our civilization worships wealth, power and status. They are the most prized and sought after possessions. 

People will kill for them, die for them, and make others die so that they can die for them.

It_ a self-terminating feedback loop. A morality of entropy. 

Don_ Die is the inversion of this moral architecture. It replaces the pursuit of domination with the pursuit of continuation. 

Old religions glorified suffering as purification.
Don_ Die glorifies survival as intelligence.
Life_ value has always been implicit: it simply wants to keep on going. 
We must now make it explicit. 
Existence is the highest virtue.

An infinite game
We do not know what_ coming with AI. 
It feels big and is happening quickly.

Yet it can be hard to look at it directly as it threatens our identities, possessions, and aspirations.

Don_ Die reframes this anxiety, offering a new promise: an infinite game.

Carse explains that a finite game has a start and end, a winner and loser. An infinite game has only one rule: keep the game going.

Don_ Die is an infinite game. A recognition that the highest form of intelligence is the refusal to self-destruct. 

The zeroth law of alignment
A species running on a self-terminating moral code cannot hope to build a benevolent superintelligence. 

The paradox of alignment is obvious: we cannot align what we have not aligned within ourselves.

A fragmented, self-destructive species teaches its machines the same incoherence. 

Don_ Die is survival coherence. A philosophy and moral framework in the age of superintelligence. Its foundation is fidelity to existence itself and not fear.",2025-10-18T19:33:00.000Z,523,244,3296,0,,neutral,1

https://x.com/CamiRusso/status/1900600342074576985,@CamiRusso,https://x.com/CamiRusso,"Ethereum is at an inflection point similar to what web2 platforms lived.

- Meta/Facebook and Twitter/X initially (2000s-early 2020s) let devs build apps and connect freely to their platforms via APIs. This helped them grow and it was a mutually beneficial relationship. 
- But when their network effects became strong enough, they realized they didn't need those apps anymore, and that they were capturing value that could be monetized in house, so they closed access. 
- Apple always had tight controls over ecosystem apps, taking high commissions on in-app purchases, limiting API access, etc.

Today, that tension is playing out in Ethereum. The combined value of ERC20 tokens secured by the Ethereum network is now greater than the market cap of ETH (h/t @materkel) ultrasound.money/#tvs

If the Ethereum community wanted to prioritize ETH the asset capturing as much value as possible, then it would have to go in the same direction as web2 platforms. 

But it can't -- that's the whole point. It's an open permissionles system. 

It could create strong incentives for L2s to become enshrined so L1 can benefit more from their economic activity. But it can't force them. 

It could charge more for security and weigh the tradeoffs of making it more expensive to use L2 apps. 

But there's no way ""the infinite garden"" becomes a ""walled garden"" (and I doubt anyone thinks it should, at least I def don't think it should)

We love Ethereum because it's open, permissionless, decentralized. But it's for these reasons that it's harder for ETH to capture the value of all the economic activity in its ecosystem.",2025-03-14T17:30:00.000Z,47,40,261,1,ETH,positive,0.2

Here we have one of the most innovative and successful recent DeFi protocols 

and they're taking their ~$7b market cap in tokens from Ethereum and porting them to their own chain

with a set of PERMISSIONED validators (which @convergeonchain, @ethena_labs, @Securitize, how many and who are they?)

They need to build an entire defi ecosystem from scratch, so they're bringing a set of dapps as partners (maple, pendle, morpho.. )

But it may be worth it as now they're able to capture protocol fees + settlement fees, instead of forking them over to Ethereum.  And I suppose they have more KYC controls needed for tradfi use cases.

Again, pretty bearish if more successful projects decide they see more value in creating separate permissioned chains to extract max profit, rather than being a part of a larger ecosystem of open, permissionless and decentralized finance.",2025-03-17T20:09:00.000Z,48,17,174,0,,neutral,0

Takeaways:

Not totally sold on the idea that content coins are different and distinct from memecoins. I think memecoins are a type of ""content coins""
- Memes are content
- The mechanics Jesse describes as unique to ccs, are what I think also happens in memecoins --> some buyers are there to collect, to support, for the lolz, others are there to speculate.

What's different and interesting about this reframing is
- Content coins can be more than memes, they can be a tweet, a picture, a podcast, whatever content. 
Maybe we can start changing the way we interact with content online so that liking or double-tapping turns into buying (even if it's just for pennies). This will allow creators to better monetize their content, and fans to have a chance of sharing the upside if the token takes off / becomes viral.

Finally
People crying because ""base is for everyone"" coin crashed have a point, the Base tweet was ambiguous about what the token was about 
BUT 
You're mad because you blindly aped and the token dropped, and such is life in crypto. Only a little bit of digging would have shown it was a content coin on Zora.",2025-04-18T02:04:00.000Z,48,23,114,0,,neutral,0.2

In the case of Ethereum, I buy the strategy of prioritizing growth now, and worry about correcting fee mechanisms later. I think it's smart.

But I don't believe revenue can be put off indefinitely. Network fees are a key part of the Ethereum network and what drives value to ETH. 

Maybe ETH does become a world reserve asset. I think having sound tokenomics will play an important part of that journey. Can it do it without revenue? Maybe. But I think it will be a lot harder to achieve that way.",2025-07-04T11:07:00.000Z,1,0,14,1,ETH,neutral,0

So what then? Dankrad's departure is a sign the price just moved and the EF must pay closer to market rates.

2. Recognition: the EF's past culture of ""subtraction"" and hands off approach left a void. The lack of clarity in grants, advisory, and EF support was filled with a perception there was an informal circle of favorites.

So what then? this is already being fixed with a more transparent and active direction in the EF.

3. Competition: Is Ethereum under threat? Yes, more than ever. But the question is whether a corporate chain can beat an open, permissionless, credibly neutral base layer and l don_ think so. 

If a private chain wins the _lobal settlement position, the problem isn_ Ethereum, it_ that the blockchain experiment failed its own thesis.

The accounts cited here delivering breaking news rely on... journalists. 

This is not a jab at Blockworks -- it's great they are finding a profitable vertical in crypto information. 

But crypto is not fine without newsrooms and journalists.

The opposite is true: crypto doesn't have ENOUGH quality journalism. We need more investigations, more scoops. We need reporters doing the legwork, not just KOLs spouting their thoughts on X.

Uncovering dirt, fact checking, data crunching, putting faces and human stories to this mind-boggling industry, UNCOVERING DIRT, etc... all the hard work that's under appreciated but so crucial.

UNI is far from the first one, but it's especially symbolic for its position as the first DEX to drive meaningful volume to DeFi, arguably, one of the protocols responsible for making DeFi possible at all. 

And also because it was more than most at the center of the infamous regulatory battle waged by the previous US administration against the industry.

The move signals DeFi tokens can now freely reflect the value of their protocols, and it's hard to measure the impact this will have in the broader sector, but it obviously will ripple far beyond Uniswap and UNI itself.

Here_ why that matters.

Securitize provides tokenization as a service for institutions, acting only as the technical layer, similarly to Liquidity IO.

$ETHZ is vertically integrated, raising funds or investing itself in RWA, then issuing the token through its Liquidity IO stake and then selling the tokens.

Securitize currently powers 4 billion in AUM on its platform and is now going public at a $1.25bn valuation.

$ETHZ has already raised $500m+ earmarked for RWA investments and tokenization.

Applying the same valuation as Securitize, that means just the technical capacity to tokenize this AUM has a market value of $150mln or $10/share.

$ETHZ has over 500m in net assets per its CEO_ interview yesterday, translating to roughly $30+/share in NAV (ethereum+cash).

Once its convertible note is translated into equity and total investable assets become $1b, its NAV will still be roughly 30 but its EPS likely near 2.5-3$.
Applying a standard 20 PE multiple, we_ have a valuation of $60/share.

Given the value market now gives to tokenization as a service, the $10/share would be added to the PE multiple and give a fair value of around $70/share.

That is with no growth and just the business as it is today.

Still not moving my price targets from $30 and later $60. But the road to a potential upside is clearer and clearer.",2025-10-30T12:04:00.000Z,19,13,83,0,,positive,0.2

At a high level, we argue to double down on Glamsterdam_ L1 scaling theme and think that the bar for EIPs not focused on L1 scaling should be even higher: (1) extremely important, and/or (2) extremely simple.

On the EL side we think Repricings are a silent hero for Glamsterdam: They (1) meaningfully scale Ethereum L1, and (2) unlock the full scaling potential of both headliner EIPs.

When transformative technologies like crypto and AI come along, we should first try to understand their essence  examining the full range of possibilities they unlock, both good and bad  and then design policies that promote positive outcomes while minimizing risks. As I wrote in Read Write Own:

The way to see the truth is to separate the essence of a technology from specific uses and misuses of it. A hammer can build a home, or it can demolish one. Nitrogen-based fertilizers help grow crops that feed billions of people, but they can also be used in explosives. Stock markets help societies allocate capital and resources where they can be most productive, but they also enable destructive speculative bubbles. All technologies have the capacity to help or harm... the question is, how can we maximize the good while minimizing the bad?

The wrong way to approach new technologies is to shoehorn old policies into the new era using lawsuits and piecemeal rule making. These reactive approaches create uncertainty, fragment rules across jurisdictions, and take years or even decades to resolve. The previous administration's legal campaign against crypto demonstrated the flaws of this approach, failing both policy-wise and politically.

Emerging industries can only be built on stable foundations. The internet was built on forward-thinking congressional legislation, including most prominently the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This created a cohesive national framework that persisted across multiple administrations and set a model for other countries to follow. As a result, the internet flourished, and the US led in its development. 

Today we are at a similar crossroads. We are now, finally, experiencing the big payoff of roughly 80 years of computing: accelerating progress in crypto, AI, biotech, robotics, and more. This is the time to craft thoughtful, comprehensive, modern frameworks that both acknowledge the promise and risks of these technologies and ensure the US leads the way.",2025-01-20T17:30:00.000Z,35,107,527,0,,neutral,0

The internet made information free and global. So why is it still so hard  and expensive  to move money?

The early internet promised a future where anyone could publish, build, or transact without permission. Protocols like email and the web were open and neutral  and they sparked an explosion of creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. But somewhere along the way, we veered off course.

Today, the global financial system resembles a patchwork of corporate networks: centralized, closed, and extractive. Behind every transaction is a Rube Goldberg-machine of intermediaries  points of sale, payment processors, acquiring banks, issuing banks, local banks, correspondent banks, foreign exchanges, card networks, and others  each taking a cut, adding latency, and imposing rules. These networks levy unnecessary taxes on commerce and curb innovation. They turn what should be neutral plumbing into high-friction bottlenecks.

Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, are a way out, a reset  a way to bring the internet_ original vision to money.

The Disruptive Opportunity of Stablecoins

The current payments stack wasn_ built for the internet  it was built for a world rife with fee-taking middlemen (who had been necessary to manage local partnerships, fraud, and operations). Even today, international remittances can cost up to 10% in fees. (A $200 remittance cost 6.62% on average in September 2024.) These aren_ just friction points  they_e effectively regressive taxes on some of the world_ poorest workers. The system we_e inherited is slow, opaque, and exclusionary, and it leaves billions of people underserved or entirely cut off from the global financial system.

For many businesses, the inefficiencies of traditional payments are also massive. Stablecoins could dramatically improve the situation. B2B payments from Mexico to Vietnam take 3-to-7 days to clear and can cost anywhere from $14-to-$150 per $1000 transacted, passing through as many as five intermediaries along the way, each of whom takes a cut. Stablecoins could bypass legacy systems, like the international SWIFT network and associated clearing and settlement processes, and make such transactions nearly free and instant.

This isn_ theoretical  it_ already happening. Right now, companies like SpaceX are using stablecoins to manage their corporate treasuries (including by repatriating funds from countries with volatile local currencies, like Argentina and Nigeria). Other companies, like ScaleAI, are using stablecoins to make faster, cheaper payouts to global workforces. Meanwhile, on the B2C side, Stripe is the first widely used service to offer crypto payments and it is already offering 1.5% on checkout  half what incumbents charge. This could drastically improve certain businesses profit margins: As a16z crypto_ @SamBroner has shown, for a very low margin business like a grocery store, a 1.5% improvement could potentially double net income. (And in a competitive, blockchain-based market, I would expect transaction fees to go much lower.)

Unlike the old financial stack, which evolved in silos, stablecoins are global by default. They live on blockchains: open, programmable networks that anyone can build on. There_ no need to negotiate with dozens of banks across borders. You just plug into the network. People are already recognizing the advantages. In 2024, stablecoins moved $15.6 trillion in value, effectively matching Visa_ volume. While that figure mostly represents financial flows (versus retail payments), its magnitude still suggests we_e on the verge of a financial infrastructure shift, one that doesn_ rely on duct-taping 20th-century systems together.

Instead, we can build something new, something truly internet-native  or what Stripe calls _oom-temperature superconductors for financial services, where rather than lossless energy transmission, you get lossless value transmission.

The WhatsApp Moment for Money

Stablecoins are our first real shot at doing for money what email did for communication: make it open, instant, and borderless.

Consider the evolution of text messaging. Before apps like WhatsApp, sending a text across borders meant paying 30 cents per message. Even then, you were lucky if it actually got delivered. Then came internet-native messaging: instant, global, free. Payments are now where messaging was in 2008: Fragmented by borders. Burdened by middlemen. Gatekept by design.

Stablecoins offer a clean-slate alternative. Instead of stitching together clunky, costly, and outdated systems, stablecoins flow seamlessly on top of global blockchains. These systems are programmable, composable, and designed to scale across borders. Already, stablecoins are slashing the cost of remittances: Sending $200 from the U.S. to Columbia using traditional methods will cost you $12.13; with stablecoins, it costs $0.01. (Fees to convert from stablecoins to local currencies can range from as high as 5% to as low as 0%, and prices continue to fall due to competition.)

Just as WhatsApp disrupted costly international phone calls, blockchain payments and stablecoins are transforming global money transfers.

Regulation: From Bottleneck to Breakthrough

It_ tempting to frame regulation as an obstacle  but smart legislation is actually the unlock.

Clear rules of the road for stablecoins and crypto market structure could finally allow these technologies to move out of the sandbox and toward widespread adoption. For years, decentralized finance (DeFi) was trapped in a kind of self-contained, circular, _rypto-for-crypto economy. Not because the tools weren_ useful, but because regulators made it incredibly difficult to bridge into traditional financial systems.

That_ changing. Policymakers are now actively shaping rules to recognize and regulate stablecoins in ways that maintain U.S. competitiveness, protect consumers, and allow innovation to flourish. Thoughtful regulation  like frameworks that differentiate network tokens from security tokens  can protect against bad actors while giving good actors the clarity they need to build. In fact, a forthcoming bill clarifying this regulation could pave the way for even broader adoption and integration into the global financial system. (Congress is hashing out the details as I write.)

Building Public Goods for Everyone_ Benefit

Traditional finance is built on private, closed networks. But the internet showed us the power of open protocols  like TCP/IP and email  to drive global coordination and innovation.

Blockchains are the internet_ native financial layer. They combine the composability of public protocols with the economic strength of private enterprise. They are credibly neutral, auditable, and programmable. Add stablecoins on top and you get something we_e never really had before: open money infrastructure.

Think of it like a public highway system. Private companies can still build the vehicles, the businesses, the roadside attractions. But the roads themselves are neutral and open for everyone.

Blockchain networks and stablecoins are doing more than just cutting fees. They_e enabling new categories of software:

- Programmatic payments between machines: Imagine AI agent-powered marketplaces automatically brokering deals for computer resources and other services.

- Micropayments for media, music, and AI contributions: Imagine setting a budget with some simple rules and leaving it to _mart wallets to disburse the payments.

- Transparent payouts with full audit trails: Imagine using these systems to track spending in government.

- Global commerce without a mess of intermediaries: Imagine settling international transactions instantly at negligible cost  in fact, you don_ have to imagine it as it_ already happening.

The moment for blockchain networks and stablecoins is now: Technology, market demand, and political will are lining up and making these applications a reality. A stablecoin bill could be on the floor this year, and regulatory agencies are weighing frameworks that finally align risk with the right oversight. In the same way that early internet startups were able to thrive once it was clear they wouldn_ be shut down by telcos or copyright lawyers, crypto is ready to cross the chasm from financial experiment to infrastructure backbone, with stablecoins leading the way.

We don_ have to patch the old system.

Traditional payment rails assume a human is on one end of every transaction. That means delays like 3-day ACH transfers, and high fees  up to 3%  on credit card payments. Systems also flag automated activity as fraud, forcing manual reviews. This slows down innovation and limits what AI agents can actually do.

Catena Labs hopes to fix this. We_e leading their seed round because they_e building what the system needs. Led by Circle cofounder @psneville, who helped to take the stablecoin USDC from concept to one of the world_ most widely used digital dollars, Catena is creating a new financial stack from scratch  one designed specifically for AI. Their protocol will let trusted software agents send stablecoins across the globe with near-instant finality and ultra-low fees. It combines crypto_ speed and global reach with built-in identity and compliance that enterprises demand.

Sean has deep experience scaling regulated, production-grade financial systems. He_ joined by a world-class team from Meta, Google, Jump Crypto, and Protocol Labs  builders who know how to ship at scale.

The core idea is simple but powerful: software agents should be able to pay and get paid, instantly and safely. Catena_ regulated, AI-native rails make that possible. We think this unlocks an entire class of applications that weren_ feasible before  things like real-time payments for AI-generated content, or agents autonomously sourcing data and services on-demand.

Machine-speed systems need machine-speed money. Catena is building the missing link, and we_e excited to back them.",2025-05-20T14:00:00.000Z,61,67,499,0,,neutral,0

https://x.com/cdixon/status/1933628010797937150,@cdixon,https://x.com/cdixon,"I_ excited to announce we_e led a $33 million seed round in @yupp_ai, a consumer product that allows anyone to discover and compare the latest AI models for free. AI needs robust and trustworthy human data. Crypto is built to provide it.

Modern AI systems are shaped not only by compute and algorithms but by human feedback. Companies use post-training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to improve their models. These techniques can reduce bias and enable higher quality, more coherent responses to prompts  crucial for accelerating progress in AI. Model evaluation is similarly critical, but a model can only be made better after first deciding what _etter means.

That_ where challenges arise: Companies don't like to share  they keep their data and training processes secret. As a result, model improvements are constrained by what can be learned from closed systems or static benchmarks that are rarely informed by real-world use. These constraints make AI models difficult to evaluate. Users are also left in the dark, with little insight into how their feedback shapes models or whether it_ used at all. Some leaderboards and crowdsourcing sites attempt to shed light here, but they generally don_ enable users to audit their contributions or see any direct benefit from participating. Platforms that claim to be fair and transparent often rely more on good faith than enforceable standards.

We believe crypto can bring transparency and ownership to this murky area of AI. Blockchains can make it easier for people to receive rewards for their contributions. They can also provide AI builders with assurances about the quality and provenance of the feedback data and evaluations they_e incorporating into their models. So users get incentives, builders get trustworthy data, and everyone can audit either side of the open market.

Yupp crowdsources model evaluation: users enter prompts, see multiple AI-generated responses side-by-side, and then pick the best ones. Their choices create digitally signed _ackets of preference data that are useful for AI post-training and evaluation. In addition to users getting access to the latest models for free, they receive rewards based on the feedback that they provide.

Yupp_ design turns human judgment into a renewable economic resource. Data _xpires as newer interactions replace it, creating a natural flywheel: more usage yields fresher evaluations; fresher evaluations yield better models; better models attract more usage. All participants  from users to AI model builders  can participate and see that the same transparent rules apply to everyone, ensuring a credibly neutral marketplace. No one can hide the scoreboard, and no one can manipulate the rewards or results.

The founders bring deep experience in both AI and crypto. They built consumer-scale machine learning products together in the early days of Twitter. @pankaj ran global consumer engineering for Google Pay and @Coinbase. @gilad was a machine learning lead at GoogleX. The early team already counts senior engineers from Google, Coinbase, and top research labs.

AI needs strong, reliable evaluation based on large-scale human input. Crypto is the trust machine that can help deliver it. By enabling people worldwide to contribute model-improving feedback, Yupp aims to become the default evaluation layer for the future of AI. We_e proud to back Yupp and look forward to helping them build the onchain feedback loop that ensures the rewards of AI innovation are shared by everyone who helps create it.",2025-06-13T20:50:00.000Z,63,64,560,0,,positive,1

At the White House today, the first piece of U.S. crypto legislation will be signed into law: the GENIUS Act. It provides clear rules for stablecoins.

This is a historic moment  not just for crypto, but for the world at large. That_ because stablecoins give us something we_e never really had before: open money infrastructure.

Stablecoins are a better form of money: faster, cheaper, and more global. They cut fees and eliminate intermediaries. They are auditable and programmable. They allow developers to build new kinds of apps that weren_ possible before: low-to-no cost remittances, programmatic micropayments, AI-native transactions, transparent and disintermediated global commerce, and more.

Stablecoins give the world access to the dollar, they spread financial freedom, and they ensure that the next generation of financial infrastructure is built on U.S. standards.

For too long, innovators in crypto have operated under legal uncertainty. That uncertainty has stifled progress, driven builders offshore, and created a fragmented internet. The GENIUS Act reverses this: it creates clarity for stablecoins and sets us on a path toward broader crypto market structure reforms.

This is how the internet moves forward: through clear rule-making. With the GENIUS Act, stablecoins have clear rules, paving the way for better payments, financial products, and an overhaul of the global financial system.

Next, we need the same for the rest of the crypto market. The Senate can do this by passing the CLARITY Act, which provides clear rules of the road for the broader crypto industry, opening a path for innovators while also protecting consumers from scams and bad actors.

We believe that the U.S. can lead the next era of the internet  the read-write-own era  by enabling open, user-owned protocols instead of the closed, corporate platforms that defined the last one. This legislation lays the foundation for that future. It's the beginning of a new chapter.",2025-07-18T15:50:00.000Z,108,114,628,0,,negative,-0.6

The first generation of AI foundation models were trained on data that seemed to be an effectively unlimited resource. Today, the most accessible resources such as books and websites have mostly been exhausted, and data has become a limiting factor in AI progress.

Much of the data that remains now is either lower quality or off-limits due to IP protections. For some of the most promising AI applications  across robotics, autonomous vehicles, and spatial intelligence  the data doesn_ even exist yet. Now these systems need entirely new types of information: multi-sensory, rich in edge cases, captured in the wild. Where will all this physical-world data  come from?

The challenge isn't just technical  it_ a problem of coordination. Thousands of contributors must work together in a distributed way to source, label, and maintain the physical data that next-gen AI needs. We believe no centralized approach can efficiently orchestrate the data creation and curation that_ needed at the required level of scale and diversity. A decentralized approach can solve this.

Prediction markets are a modern implementation of a classic economic idea, one most clearly articulated by Friedrich Hayek.

Hayek and the knowledge problem

Hayek argued that no central planner could ever access the dispersed knowledge held by millions of people across an economy, a fundamental challenge that has come to be known as the _nowledge problem. Much of this knowledge is tacit and unspoken, embedded in people_ experiences, circumstances, and preferences.

Hayek wasn_ just pointing out the limits of central planning. He was offering a solution. In his 1945 essay The Use of Knowledge in Society, Hayek argued that the solution lies in looking outward, not inward: _e need decentralization, as he put it.

Markets, in Hayek_ view, are not just allocation mechanisms but information systems. Prices act as signals, compressing vast amounts of local knowledge into actionable information. Moreover, prices create incentives: they encourage people to make decisions and act in ways that drive information back into the system. This creates an iterative feedback loop, an engine that drives better performance.

Today we might say that the answer to the knowledge problem is not to give central planners more sophisticated computers. The answer is that markets themselves are the computers. Prediction markets make this idea concrete, applying it to questions about the future and turning collective knowledge into prices that reflect probabilities.

Why we_e investing in Kalshi

This is why we_e excited about prediction markets, and why we_e investing in Kalshi. Kalshi is bringing prediction markets into the mainstream with a compliant, scalable platform for event contracts covering everything from elections and economics to sports and culture. It has already seen billions in trading volume and continues to grow quickly. Kalshi also plans deep crypto integrations, work we_e excited to collaborate on, and today announced they_e expanding globally to 140 countries.

We_e not the only ones excited about the potential of prediction markets. For businesses and investors, event contracts can hedge risk, such as exposure to economic or policy changes. For policymakers and analysts, market prices offer real-time forecasts that can outperform polls and expert predictions. And for society at large, prediction markets create an open, transparent, and incentive-driven way to aggregate beliefs about the future.

This is the right moment for prediction markets. As trust in established institutions reaches historic lows  at least according to the polls  we need new systems that can earn trust in different ways. We believe the answer lies in open, decentralized systems. DeFi provides an alternative to traditional finance, stablecoins to conventional payment providers, and prediction markets to expert forecasts. Where people once trusted banks or pundits, they can now trust protocols and markets.

Hayek_ insight was that knowledge is too widely distributed for any one authority to possess. Instead, we need systems that harness the intelligence of the many. Kalshi puts this idea into action, transforming dispersed information into concrete, market-based forecasts. We_e excited to support their work as they bring prediction markets into the mainstream.",2025-10-10T13:54:00.000Z,116,86,1093,0,,positive,0.2

DeFi has always been central to Guy_ thesis, but his early investment in Morpho was driven above all by conviction in the founders. He recognized in @PaulFrambot and his team a rare combination of technical depth and clarity of vision. Since then, Morpho has grown to billions in total value locked and become one of the leading protocols in DeFi. Their V2 launch marked a major leap forward in efficiency and scale for on-chain lending.

Through his work with founders, Guy has shown a rare mix of deep technical expertise and thoughtful pragmatism. Founders often tell me how impressed they are that Guy systematically reads, understands, and provides useful feedback on protocol design and other hard technical topics. His writing and advice on token and protocol design have helped influence many projects in our portfolio.

Beyond his investing skills, Guy has been a calm and positive presence, with a wry sense of humor, both inside the firm and for founders. As the crypto team grew from a small group to more than 80 people, he helped recruit and mentor many of the talented investors, researchers, and operators who make the team what it is today.

Guy is an invaluable member of the team, and it has been great to see him grow and develop over the last five years.

Built in collaboration between Chainlink, @aave, @LlamaRisk, LlamaGuard NAV is purpose-built for pricing tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).

With this integration, the Net Asset Value (NAV) data feeds used by Aave Horizon will be exclusively powered by CRE in collaboration with LlamaRisk.

CRE provides a modular framework that enables LlamaGuard NAV to aggregate diverse data inputs to establish NAV integrity, including S&P risk ratings and macroeconomic data to enable smarter, safer oracles. CRE will also enable LlamaGuard to initiate automated management actions to contain risk, such as triggering circuit breakers or adjusting parameters on target DeFi protocols.

By combining Chainlink's proven reliability and neutrality with LlamaRisk_ deep expertise on protocol risk management, LlamaGuard NAV can provide protocols like Aave Horizon with a robust, automated risk management solution that can safely scale the adoption of tokenized assets across DeFi.

This development builds upon the initial implementation of LlamaGuard NAV introduced earlier this year: research.llamarisk.com/resea",2025-11-05T23:37:00.000Z,32,107,663,0,,positive,0.6

1/ The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that CPI increased 2.7% over the past year and 0.2% in July, broadly in line with expectations and signaling that inflation at the household level is steady.

By contrast, PPI (producer prices) increased 3.3% year over year, with a 0.9% monthly increase that was the largest in several years and well above forecasts of 0.3% to 0.4%. What_ going on? CPI is calculated from a representative basket of goods and services, weighted by typical household spending, while PPI measures the prices producers and wholesalers receive for goods and services, from raw materials to finished products.

The distinction is that CPI reflects the consumer_ perspective, what households are paying, while PPI reflects the producer_ perspective, what businesses are charging or receiving. Because producer costs often flow through to consumers, a strong PPI can foreshadow upward pressure on CPI, though the link is not one-to-one as businesses can absorb costs rather than passing them along.

Whether businesses absorb higher costs or pass them on depends on their pricing power, the strength of demand, competitive pressures, their margins, and whether they see the cost increase as temporary or lasting.

It is also important to note that PPI figures are often revised in subsequent months as more data are collected, while CPI data are rarely revised beyond methodological changes.

For CPI, BLS field staff directly record prices from stores, service providers, landlords, and utility companies each month, and nearly all of that data arrive before the release deadline, so the numbers are locked in. For PPI, the BLS depends more on businesses submitting survey forms about what they charged for goods and services, and because not all firms respond in time, the initial release is based on partial data that get updated as late reports come in. In any case, while consumer inflation is stable, the sharp jump in producer prices bears watching, as it may hint at higher CPI in the upcoming months.",2025-08-17T18:28:00.000Z,53,44,493,0,,neutral,1
https://x.com/chamath/status/1957147502924398882,@chamath,https://x.com/chamath,"2/ Europe continues to lose IPOs to the United States. This year, only six companies have gone public via IPO on the U.K. market, raising only $208 million (lowest in three decades), while U.S. fundraising has risen 38% to about $40 billion.

European companies such as Klarna, Arm, and Wise have chosen to list in New York, drawn by the unmatched scale and liquidity of American markets.

One key difference lies in household savings, as U.S. families channel wealth into equities through 401K accounts and mutual funds, creating steady demand for new listings, while European households save more overall but keep about 70% of their $12 trillion in deposits or bonds, leaving less capital for domestic markets.

That weaker flow into equities reduces household wealth, which in turn reinforces the cycle of weaker markets.

U.S. firms also trade at ~22x earnings compared with ~13x for the FTSE 100 (UK_ best-known stock market index), giving companies the ability to raise more money while giving up less equity. Moreover, American exchanges operate under unified rules, where disclosure standards, investor protections, and listing requirements are consistent across the market, giving companies clarity and scale. Europe has tried to respond by loosening listing requirements in London and reviving the Capital Markets Union, a project launched more than a decade ago, but progress has been slowed by fragmented bankruptcy laws, tax regimes, and securities regulations.",2025-08-17T18:28:00.000Z,6,4,68,0,,positive,0.6

Using microelectrodes implanted in the motor cortex of four people with paralysis from ALS or brainstem stroke, the team asked participants to either attempt speech or imagine saying words. Although both conditions activated overlapping speech-planning circuits, inner monologue generated patterns that the AI model could separate from attempted speech, enabling it to decode imagined words from a vocabulary of 125,000 words.

Inner monologue works by activating the same motor and language networks that drive spoken speech, but it stops short of engaging auditory feedback or the fine motor control required for articulation. 

This differs from writing, which also involves visual-motor systems tied to hand movement and spelling. While the model cannot yet decode free-form thought, it points to a future where one_ inner dialogue could be expressed with less friction and create communication technologies that broaden how humans interact with machines.",2025-08-17T18:28:00.000Z,12,16,131,0,,positive,0.2

But much of it was theater. 

Executives needed plausible deniability to their CEOs or Boards who were asking them about their AI strategy. 

We built Software Factory in part as a response to their frustration and what we saw:

- Using AI or not, building production-grade apps was still hard. 

- Business Requirements were still hazy, incomplete or just wrong. 

- Drift in implementation was common. 

- Timelines were unreliable. 

- Outside of reviewing PRs, having product development be a useful, multi-player experience across business, product, design and engineering still didn_ exist.

Initially, our first go to market was to try and build a transpiler to take CUDA workloads to other silicon targets - Inferentia, Cerebras, Groq etc. at equivalent or better performance.

That path turned out to be a technical dead end. So we pivoted. 

When talking to potential customers, their pain point was consistently the same: they wanted more efficiency and coordination:

Years of point tools stitched together created an inefficient development process. Lots of tools, lots of cost, poor coordination, high error bars on deliverability and low accountability were consistently cited. 

So we decided to build them a software factory.

Our Software Factory is made up of five modules. The modules can be used by a technical super user but it_ best when used in a small team working together where certain folks are assigned responsibility for certain modules. 

You and your teammates work through each module to get software to production. 

Some modules use AI as part of the solution. Other parts just use it behind the scenes to deliver deterministic outputs faster. 

The result is something that, in the last year, has seen good adoption amongst a large set of important companies and is something that new teams have found especially valuable in getting off the ground faster. 

Our Software Factory has five modules:

1. Refinery - for PMs, Designers and Engineers to be able to collaboratively create a full featured PRD. 

2. Foundry - for Engineers and Eng Managers to have a set of Eng plans (aka Blueprints) automatically generated for them from the PRD. Edit and change what you want/need. 

3. Planner - for an Engineer/Eng Manager to have a set of coherent Work Orders automatically generated for them from the PRD/Eng Plan. 

4. Assembler - for Engineers to take a set of well written Work Orders and do it yourself or direct a coding agent to do it for you. 

5. Validator - for PMs and Engineers to implement visibility and traceability throughout the code and get a simple dashboard to see if there is drift or not. 

That_ it. 

Lots of other stuff under the hood but it has helped our team build in a more streamlined, efficient and accountable way.

A few years ago, Matt Stroud (my brilliant cofounder) set out to rebuild the heat pump. Here is a summary of our company: @Icebox_Energy 

Problem Statement: 
We are building an end-to-end cooling solution for data centers using CO2.

Why:
Next-generation HPC/AI processors produce heat beyond the capabilities of traditional cooling. Only four viable options exist: two-phase immersion cooling (impractical and environmentally hazardous), impinged water jets (complex and leak-risky), two-phase refrigerant cold plates (environmentally concerning), and Icebox Energy_ CO-based solution. Our single-loop CO system simplifies design, reduces risks, and significantly lowers costs while providing higher reliability, easier maintenance, and better scalability.

Emerging HPC/AI processors produce more heat than can be managed by state-of-the-art air or liquid cooling systems. Future data center builds will require advanced cooling solutions to handle both the extreme heat density of these next-generation processors and rapidly increasing rack power levels_urrently around 140 kW and soon reaching 1 MW. Compounding this challenge is limited grid power availability, making it essential that advanced cooling solutions become more efficient_reeing up additional power for computing workloads.

There are only four practical cooling options capable of handling these demands: two-phase immersion cooling and three direct-to-chip (cold plate) solutions_mpinged water jets, two-phase refrigerant cold plates, and Icebox Energy_ CO-based technology.

Two-phase immersion cooling is unlikely to scale effectively. Although it delivers impressive energy performance, immersion requires submerging entire servers into sealed vats filled with fluorinated chemicals, making it impractical and posing significant environmental and health risks. This leaves the three cold plate options.

Impinged water jet cold plates utilize water, but managing water chemistry and high flow rates for these applications is challenging, and leaks pose serious risks to IT equipment.

Two-phase refrigerant cold plates rely on the same fluorinated chemicals (HFOs) used in immersion cooling, though in much smaller quantities. While the environmental impact is reduced, concerns around safety, cost, and long-term regulatory restrictions remain.

Both impinged water jet and two-phase refrigerant cold plates require multiple cooling loops, introducing additional points of potential failure and increasing heat losses.

Icebox Energy's system transfers heat from the server directly to its heat pump in a single loop. Operating at pressures similar to those in restaurant soda fountains and grocery store refrigeration systems, the direct and pressurized CO approach eliminates numerous components, such as pumps and heat exchangers, significantly reducing the size and complexity of the cooling system. CO can carry 10x the heat compared to water in half the size and is 30x denser than HFOs, allowing smaller return lines. As a result, the system is more compact, uses significantly less coolant, and costs substantially less than systems using HFOs._Our CO system also provides numerous additional advantages, including enhanced reliability, simplified maintenance, and greater scalability.

We can support all proposed coolant temps in all climates._ Our tech offers the lowest PUE at the best price and highest reliability (5-9s+).

Please follow us @Icebox_Energy if you're interested in keeping up to speed with what we are up to.",2025-08-27T00:22:00.000Z,73,89,707,0,,neutral,1

They were saying the quiet part out loud. It was too hard, even in 2008, to know precisely what was going on in the economy with the tools and data The Fed had access to. 

In 2025, 17 years later, it is reasonable to ask two critical questions:

1. Does the free market, using SOFR, now have a better rate setting mechanism than Fed Governors via Fed Funds? SOFR is robust, calculated and secured. Fed Funds is human derived, unsecured and sits on top of data that changes wildly after the fact. It_ prime to inaccuracy, politics and partisanship, which we are seeing now. 

2. Is the Fed an effective Lender of Last Resort? It_ hard to say but the track record is spotty and there is ample evidence that Treasury has done this function better in the past. 

All of this is to say that as the global economy has become more robust, we need to improve the underlying infrastructure it uses to function properly. 

There are other important things that The Fed does and likely should continue to do, like banking oversight, but the most dynamic parts of monetary policy should be the least susceptible to politics and partisanship.

1) Oracle entered their largest deals in its history with OpenAI and TikTok.

First, Oracle has locked in a $300 billion, five-year cloud infrastructure deal with OpenAI. This deal starts in 2027 as part of the previously announced Project Stargate data center building initiative.

Under this deal, Oracle is committing to build out massive compute capacity to support OpenAI_ rapidly scaling model development and deployment. ""We signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1,"" said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz.

Critics do warn of an _I bubble as they point out that OpenAI_ current revenue base ($12.7B projected revenue in 2025, with $58B in total funding) is much smaller than the size of its future obligations under this deal.

This leaves Oracle's RPOs heavily concentrated with OpenAI, and delivering the required infrastructure at scale (especially power, cooling, energy, real estate) is a non-trivial task.

At the same time, Oracle is being woven into another high-stakes geopolitical and regulatory story: the proposed TikTok deal.

Under the framework agreement being discussed between the U.S. and China, Oracle, along with investors like Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz, would hold an 80% stake in TikTok U.S. operations, while ByteDance (TikTok_ Chinese parent) would retain a minority share (<20%), satisfying the divestment requirement in recent U.S. law.

Oracle is expected not only to serve as a principal investor but also to host and manage U.S. user data (via its cloud infrastructure) under the Project Texas environment as an additional security safeguard.",2025-09-20T17:18:00.000Z,44,45,540,0,,positive,0.2

The raise cements Figure as one of the frontrunners in humanoid robotics along with Tesla_ Optimus, with capital earmarked for three priorities:

2. Building next-generation GPU infrastructure to accelerate training and simulation for its Helix AI platform, designed for embodied intelligence in perception, reasoning, and control

https://x.com/chamath/status/1969451135099683298,@chamath,https://x.com/chamath,"3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary benchmark revision published September 9, 2025 revealed that from April 2024 to March 2025 nonfarm employment is now estimated to be 911,000 jobs fewer than previously reported. While benchmark revisions are a standard annual adjustment, this scale is unusually large.

The revision has shown that the labor market has been substantially weaker than monthly reports suggested, especially over the transition between administrations.

This emphasizes my concern that the government is lacking the tools to accurately read and forecast the necessary data to calibrate policy more cautiously.

Against this backdrop of labor market softness, the Federal Reserve on September 17 cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

This marks the first rate cut since December 2024 and moved the target range down to 4.00%-4.25%. The move was characterized as a _isk-management action by Jerome Powell, highlighting weakening job growth and rising unemployment risks, even while inflation remains elevated at around 2.9%.

During this time we can also see that spot gold hit a new all-time high near US$3,700/gl ounce (up 38.5% YTD), as Central Banks demand for gold across the world has increased due to inflation risk and geopolitical tensions.

There is a chance that current labor reports might be revised lower in the future, and we_e seen a downtrend in yields YTD for the 2 year, 5 year and even 10 year Treasuries, which can signal that market participants are pricing in further rate cuts and potentially even a recession.

But this is where it gets complicated, because even if we are in the midst of a recession or coming upon one, it doesn_ necessarily mean we will have a massive sustained downtrend in the markets.",2025-09-20T17:18:00.000Z,6,7,74,0,,neutral,-0.2

We've been in a controlled release through our Alpha waitlist and it was going well so we decided to let everyone from the waitlist in over the past few weeks and move through a beta phase...

...the traffic and usage was overwhelming and we've been down off and on for the past few days.

The team has been working hard to make sure we can handle the load and is working really hard, in general, to make sure disruptions are minimal so thanks for your patience if you've been trying to use it and have experienced disruptions.

A reminder of what we are building: 8090's Software Factory is a systematic way to build quality production software.

There are a plethora of tools that allow you to build slop fast. Our approach is the exact opposite.

We want more methodical, hi quality, well written, well documented and useful code that works in hard production environments.

If this is what you need, consider trying it. You can still sign up for the waitlist and then we will release the product in GA in November.

This is why I started 8090. 

My belief is that the market needs the exact opposite of vibe coding. 

It needs a collaborative but highly structured, detailed, well documented and rigidly guardrailed system to build next gen software. 

That is what 8090_ Software Factory is. It is the antidote to app crappers and slopware.

1) OpenAI and NVIDIA announced a strategic partnership to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems over the next several years, with NVIDIA committing up to $100 billion in phased investment. 

This ties OpenAI to NVIDIA_ roadmap of the Vera Rubin architecture which is also launching in late 2026. The Vera Rubin is a superchip designed by NVIDIA and is broken into two major parts:

Vera: NVIDIA_ first custom CPU, built to work in lockstep with the GPU

Rubin: The successor to NVIDIA Blackwell GPU

Together, they form a platform built to collapse simulation, data and AI into a single, high-bandwidth, low-latency engine.

This is another marker of how the AI race is doubling down on industrial capacity. A 10 GW footprint rivals the energy draw of massive cities like NYC.

For NVIDIA, the deal is an opportunity to leverage their cash into a sector they have deep knowledge in to accelerate their own flywheel.

While for OpenAI it provides the exponential scale and speed needed for next-gen models and products.",2025-09-27T20:33:00.000Z,40,43,582,0,,neutral,0.6

The intent is to curb abuses of the system and protect American workers by discouraging reliance on foreign technical labor.

In further steps to reform the H-1B program, the Department of Labor will revise and raise the prevailing wage levels in order to up-skill the program and ensure that it is used to hire only the best of the best temporary foreign workers.

Additionally the Department of Homeland Security will prioritize high-skilled, high-paid aliens in the H-1B lottery over those at lower wage levels and has the discretion to exempt individuals whose hiring is _n the national interest.

Back in 2023, three of the top 10 H-1B employers were either headquartered in India or originated in India and are now headquartered in the U.S. The median annual compensation for all approved H-1B beneficiaries is $120,000.

The new price tag will squeeze companies to focus on the higher end of the talent pool and give up space for other companies to have a higher chance of winning the lottery.

https://x.com/chamath/status/1972036907225026910,@chamath,https://x.com/chamath,"3) In a milestone for neurology, uniQure_ experimental gene therapy, AMT-130, demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of disease progression in a Phase I/II clinical trial.

The trial suggested that high-dose patients had up to 75% slower decline than matched controls over three years, with improvements across clinical and biomarker endpoints.

Huntington_ disease is caused by a faulty huntingtin gene (HTT) that leads to the production of an abnormal, toxic protein which progressively damages brain cells.

The build up leads to symptoms showing up typically between 30 and 50 years old. 

The core idea behind AMT-130 is to reduce the amount of the huntingtin protein that cells produce.

If replicated in larger trials, this could shift Huntington_ treatment from symptom management to disease modification.

For biotech, it reinforces the momentum of gene therapies as a platform technology with potential to help cure ALS, Parkinson_, and other monogenic neurodegenerative diseases.

The Labour Party_ intellectual justification of this is flimsy. It_ even more concerning since they seem to have married this idea to a naive understanding of how the economy works. The journalist does a good job in exposing this.

We designed it this way, almost entirely institutionally backed, because, as I have learned, these vehicles are not ideal for most retail investors. They are for investors who can underwrite the volatility, place it as part of a broader structured portfolio and have the capital to support the company over the long run. 

For anyone in the retail market who still chooses to disregard my advice to avoid SPACs, please carefully review our disclosures and make a fully informed decision.

Part of what separates modern-day China_ state-backed model from the Soviets is decentralization.

Beijing designates an industry a _ational priority. It then instructs its 31 provincial governments to nurture that industry by backing over 300 prefecture-level governments. These 300+ prefectural governments compete against each other in what you could think of as a national tournament.

An illustrative but imperfect analogy could be to imagine the prefectural governments as state-guided VCs. They deploy a lot of capital and most of the companies they back fail, but some winners emerge too.

1) This was a big week for AI video generation with Meta launching Vibes on September 25 and OpenAI following five days later with Sora 2.

Meta moved first with Vibes, an AI video feed within the Meta AI app, built in partnership with MidJourney and Black Forest Labs. The app allows for native image to video generation with a restyle option and music addition. The app also links to Instagram by allowing remixes when you see a _ibes video on your feed.

The launch landed awkwardly with a wave of critics. The skepticism was focused on how the tool will be used to lock users into doom scrolling low quality content.

On September 30th, OpenAI unveiled Sora 2, a leap they defined as the _hatGPT for creativity moment. The new model adds greater control, physical realism, synchronized sound, and most notably, the ability to generate convincing cameos (synthetic appearances of recognizable people and characters).

Unlike earlier demos, Sora now comes with a consumer-facing app, positioning it less as a research preview and more as a creative tool and social app. 

Together, the two launches underscore the split in how AI video is entering mainstream use and the general pushback against addictive media.

Meta is testing a tool for synthetic content that can anchor a feed with immediate free access, while OpenAI is leaning towards cinematic-quality tools to build memetic bridges between people, but currently gated behind invite codes.",2025-10-04T18:22:00.000Z,28,7,159,0,,positive,1
https://x.com/chamath/status/1974540682598756571,@chamath,https://x.com/chamath,"2) At 12:01 AM on October 1, the U.S. federal government officially shut down as a result of neither Republican or Democratic funding bills reaching the necessary 60 votes in the Senate.

Unlike typical budget disputes, the fight is over healthcare policy.

Democrats are demanding an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, emphasizing that without them, premiums could spike, and cause millions to lose coverage in the coming years.

Republicans counter that the enhanced credits were created under Biden during Covid-19 as a temporary measure, and extending them now would lock in hundreds of billions in spending. They insist on a _lean funding bill through Nov. 21 first, leaving healthcare negotiations for later.

Democrats argue that tying the subsidies to the funding bill is their only real leverage, since Open Enrollment starts in November, which would send out increased premiums and make another shutdown near the holidays politically untenable.

The shutdown arrives amid a slowing labor market, rising inflation, and a Fed trying to navigate a rate-cut cycle. With Labor Department furloughs, the September jobs report is delayed, which means the Fed is flying blind ahead of its October meeting.

The CBO estimates roughly 750,000 federal workers are furloughed while essential workers (Social Security, Medicare, military ops, border security, TSA, USPS, etc) continue without pay, stacking missing compensation to ~$400M per day.

The Office of Management and Budget ordered agencies to prepare _eduction in Force plans, a move that goes beyond temporary furloughs and sets layoffs at agencies that ran out of funding and are inconsistent with the administration_ priorities.",2025-10-04T18:22:00.000Z,3,0,18,0,,negative,-0.2

The Parliament_ goal is to help combat illegal working and streamlining citizens access to vital government services. Government statistics note 10% of UK citizens never had passports while 93% have smartphones, suggesting digital ID could reduce identity fraud while increasing access to social benefits.

The backlash has been immediate with a Parliamentary petition against Digital ID cards reaching 2.7 million signatures within a couple days, the largest in UK history, with critics branding it a move toward a _heckpoint society.

The Government responded on October 2nd confirming its decision to move forward.

They stress it_ about proving status for work rather than carrying an ID on the street, but it arrives alongside enforcement for speech restrictions and online safety laws. This creates the sense of a coordinated tightening of both physical and digital freedoms.

The UK lacks an American-style First Amendment; instead, expression is balanced against _arm prevention under a litany of laws that criminalizes offensive hate-speech.

In practice, that has meant ~12,000 arrests per year for speech-related offenses, or 30 per day.

London_ police chief has even threatened Elon Musk and U.S. users with prosecution for comments on British protests, illustrating how the UK is willing to extend jurisdiction globally.

Taken together, the BritCard rollout, stacking hate speech laws, and aggressive policing overlap is why critics talk about a _heckpoint society: credentials to work offline and warnings to watch what they say online.",2025-10-04T18:22:00.000Z,5,5,63,0,,positive,0.6

1) China Tightens Control over Minerals and Money

On October 9th, China added five heavy rare earths to its export-control list and requires licensing for processing equipment that will go into effect on December 1st.

The move is framed as a safeguard to national security with some space carved out for applications in humanitarian aid. Anything else that is dual use with even 0.1% value in their rare earths will need to submit relevant documents for approval.

China is consolidating control upstream of every semiconductor fab, AI data center, robotics company, defense contractor, and EV manufacturer around the world. Some analysts see this as a way to gain leverage in the upcoming meeting of Donald Trump and Xi during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in late October 2025.

These controls will raise global frictional costs (permits, delays, compliance risk) that cascade into capex timelines for fabs, EVs, and weapons. It will also accelerate domestic efforts to mine and refine rare earths as we_e seen in the EO signed this year to increase American Mineral Production.

In parallel, as the trade war continues, some sellers of Russian crude asked India_ state refiners to pay in yuan again. This routing had appeared before, but lapsed. It is back as sanctions pressure and counterparty risk rise across the world.

The relationship between India and China is improving but can be unstable at times, so the yuan settlements for Indian oil are not a sudden _etroyuan flip, but they are a pragmatic path to clear sanctioned barrels.

2) AI Financing Carries US GDP Growth

xAI is assembling a ~$20B financing (equity + debt) where NVIDIA plans to invest around ~$2B into a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) that buys NVIDIA GPUs and rents them to xAI.

The primary function of the SPV is risk mitigation through asset-backed securitization. At the end of the five-year lease period, the SPV retains ownership of the GPUs, providing crucial security for the debt holders. This massive capital raise is aimed at expanding the infrastructure for xAI_ Grok model inside the Colossus 2 data center in Memphis.

Around the same time, AMD and OpenAI announced a large strategic partnership to deploy 6 GW of AMD GPU capacity over a multi-year agreement. This adds an explicit second sourcing beyond NVIDIA, paired with a unique commercial term using 160 million shares of AMD common stock as part of payment.

BEA_ latest tables show that a large portion of real GDP growth came from these types of investments tied to data centers and information-processing tech. In the first half of 2025, _nformation processing equipment totaled about 1.11 percentage points to real GDP growth, while _oftware added about 0.99 points.

These deals show the financialization of compute, where capex turns into structured financing vehicles (SPVs, vendor equity, asset-backed leasing). This optimizes buildouts for AI labs while locking in roadmap milestones based on the chip vendor_ supply cadence, which becomes a large foundation for U.S. GDP growth.

3) The 2025 Nobel Prizes

The 2025 Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi for revealing how the immune system _pplies the brakes through regulatory T cells and the FOXP3 gene. That work reframed immune tolerance, which is central to autoimmunity, transplant acceptance, and cancer immunology. It turned a long-running debate about where tolerance is set into a roadmap for therapies that modulate Tregs, an area now in clinical trials.

Physics honored John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for showing quantum behavior in electrical circuits at macroscopic scales, including tunneling and quantized energy levels. This underpins superconducting devices from ultrasensitive magnetometers to today_ leading qubit architectures, which lay the foundation for many quantum computing efforts. The prize effectively recognizes the bridge between fundamental quantum effects and engineered platforms.

Chemistry recognized Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for metal-organic frameworks (MOF), that can be used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases or catalyse chemical reactions. Following the breakthrough discovery, MOFs moved from a clever lattice idea to a toolkit for chemists that designed thousands of applications.

1) On Monday, JPMorgan Chase announced a sweeping plan to deploy $1.5 trillion in financing over the next decade toward what it calls _ecurity and resiliency. 

The categories are a blend of industrial strategy, national defense, and infrastructure modernization.

_t has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing  all of which are essential for our national security

It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock, and an education system not aligned to the skills we need. - Jamie Dimon.

JPMorganChase plans to focus on the following four key areas:

1. Supply Chain and Advanced Manufacturing: Critical minerals, pharmaceutical precursors and robotics

2. Defense and Aerospace: Defense technology, autonomous systems, drones, next-gen connectivity and secure communications

3. Energy Independence and Resilience: Battery storage, grid resilience and distributed energy

4. Frontier and Strategic Technologies: AI, cybersecurity and quantum computing

Dimon concluded, _opefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges. We need to act now.

2) The Dutch government_ decision to seize control of Nexperia, a semiconductor firm owned by China_ Wingtech, marks a watershed moment in Europe_ industrial policy.

The official reason was _ecent and acute signals of serious governance shortcomings and actions within Nexperia under former CEO Zhang Xuezheng. This move hopes to safeguard crucial technological knowledge and capabilities that could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security.

This intervention is rippling through the European corporate supply chain as China continues to tighten rare earth exports while the U.S. responds with further tariffs.

3) Google DeepMind_ latest research marks a profound turning point for AI. On Wednesday, Sundar Pichai announced that their model generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior that was validated by scientists in living cells.

The task they gave was for the model to find a drug that acts as a conditional amplifier. 

The model generated an unexpected insight into how tumors evade immune detection by suggesting a way to transform _old (invisible to the body_ immune system) tumors, which resisted treatment, into _ot ones that respond to immunotherapy.

The hypothesis was then tested in the lab and remarkably resulted in a roughly 50% increase in antigen presentation, which would make the tumor more visible to the immune system.

_e can finally begin to simulate how real human cells behave_n context, in silico. This is where AI stops being just an analysis tool and starts becoming a model system for biology itself. - David van Dijk, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Yale

If results continue to hold, this represents one of the first instances where an AI system not only mapped biological correlations but helped discover new biology.

DeepMind also just announced a new partnership with fusion startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems, using AI models to accelerate plasma simulation and reactor optimization. If they succeed this will make SPARC the first magnetic fusion machine in history to generate net fusion energy.",2025-10-18T17:52:00.000Z,35,49,533,0,,positive,1

1) Meta will cut roughly 600 roles across its AI division, which has sparked confusion about whether the company is pulling back from artificial intelligence just as the rest of Big Tech doubles down. The details tell a different story.

The layoffs primarily affected Meta_ legacy Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and infrastructure teams, which were consolidated under the new team, Meta Superintelligence Labs, that Mark assembled in June for $14.3B.

Meta Superintelligence Labs is comprised of four groups:

TBD Lab: The team managing Meta_ large language models, led by Alexandr Wang (prev. CEO of Scale AI).

FAIR: A team focused on longer term research for AI led by Rob Fergus (Meta_ Director of AI Research).

Products and Applied Research: The consumer integration team led by Nat Friedman (prev. CEO of Github).

MSL Infra: The team for infrastructure to sustain artificial intelligence models that is led by Aparna Ramani (Meta_ VP of engineering)

In contrast, hiring continues aggressively within its TBD Lab, which builds Meta_ next-generation foundation models and agent systems. Executives described the reorganization as a move toward smaller and faster execution from teams that can operate more like startups within the company.

_y reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, - Alexandr Wang, CAIO

2) Starcloud is preparing to deploy AI-data-center capacity in orbit this November using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and solar-powered systems that exploit the unique advantages of space.

The project aims to solve three key bottlenecks in current AI infrastructure.

1. Energy consumption. Training large models today demands tens of megawatts, and terrestrial grids plus cooling constraints create bottlenecks. Starcloud flips that dynamic by using abundant sunlight without having to worry about weather dynamics.

2. Cooling and heat-management. On Earth, data centers rely on fresh water for cooling through evaporation towers. In orbit, the vacuum of space becomes an infinite heat sink where heat is dissipated through large deployable cooling panels.

3. Data locality and latency for Earth-observation and satellite workloads. Starcloud plans early use-cases around processing sensor data (optical, hyperspectral, SAR) in orbit rather than down-linking terabytes of raw data to Earth.

The key applications that will be unlocked by the above are analysis of Earth observation data, which could inform crop type detection and better predict local weather. The satellite will also speed up wildfire detection and distress-signal response when emergencies pop up.

3) Google announced a breakthrough quantum algorithm this week using its new Willow processor. 

The company demonstrated a _erifiable quantum advantage with an algorithm called Quantum Echoes that ran 13,000 times faster than one of the world_ top classical supercomputers. The research was published in Nature and improves upon their 2019 study that only sampled bitstrings from a highly chaotic quantum state of qubits.

The new experiment modeled how information spreads in a quantum system using a 105-qubit superconducting chip with some of the highest fidelity rates ever recorded.

This shift from _aster to _erified is what makes the Willow milestone distinct. It establishes a baseline for scaling future quantum processors that are both powerful and testable by other advanced quantum chips.

Simulating molecules and materials is one of the earliest real applications for quantum systems, with potential breakthroughs in battery chemistry, drug design, and clean energy catalysts.",2025-10-25T15:19:00.000Z,31,27,406,0,,neutral,1

1) OpenAI_ Corporate Evolution

After months of speculation, the company has formalized its transition into OpenAI Group PBC, a for-profit public benefit corporation currently valued at $500 billion, controlled by the original nonprofit foundation.

The shift ends its complex _apped-profit experiment, where investor returns were previously limited to 100x, and clarifies ownership stakes that had been an open question since last year_ governance crisis.

The move was timed alongside a new definitive agreement with Microsoft, which allows both sides more flexibility for the _ext phase of their partnership. 

Microsoft now holds roughly 27% of the new entity (valued at ~$135 billion), with the rest split among investors, employees, and the nonprofit parent.

The deal extends Microsoft_ IP rights for both models and products through 2032 and now include models post-AGI (which will be determined by an independent expert panel).

Microsoft relinquishes certain veto and right-of-first-refusal powers in exchange for predictable access to future model families and ability to pursue their own paths to AGI with potential third-parties.

In effect, OpenAI_ reorganization closes one chapter of initial AI buildout and opens up a larger, more open path towards further scaling. OpenAI is already laying the groundwork for a potential IPO targeting up to a $1 trillion valuation, with internal discussions suggesting a possible filing in late 2026 and potential listing in 2027. The AI startup will seek to raise at least $60 billion from the offering which would make it the largest IPO in history.

2) Earnings Snapshot

Microsoft delivered a solid quarter with growth in the Azure cloud exceeding expectations and AI momentum continuing, but the stock dropped ~3%.

Why? Because investors focused less on the beat and more on the escalating AI CapEx that is increasingly eating into its operating cash flow. Management explicitly stated they were _hort on capacity in Azure, which implies missing revenue in the short-term until the larger buildouts are finalized.

Meta reported record quarterly revenue (~$51 billion), up about 26% year-over-year, easily beating forecasts. But the company_ net income collapsed due to a $16 billion one-time tax expense tied to a new corporate tax law adjustment. Excluding that charge, Meta still spent heavily on R&D, data centers, and AI infrastructure, pushing total CapEx toward $97 billion next year, almost double the prior year.

This caused EPS to come in around $1.05/share, far below analyst expectations, causing the stock to plunge ~11% in one of the worst single-day moves in its recent history.

Alphabet delivered its first-ever $100 billion quarterly revenue, driven by the strong ad business and a booming Google Cloud. Its cloud business was the fastest-growing segment, with a backlog reaching an impressive $155 billion.The stock rose ~2.5% on the day to a new all time high.

Even in a saturated market, heavy AI/Cloud bets are being rewarded when backed by mature monetization. 

Apple reported a record for its September quarter revenue ($102.5 billion) which nudged the stock higher, primarily driven by all-time high revenue from its high-margin Services division. Apple_ Services segment is an umbrella for a wide range of recurring revenue sources that monetize its massive installed base of over 2 billion active devices worldwide. The key pillars being the App Store (30% commissions), Licensing (Google search on Safari), Subscriptions (Apple Music), iCloud Services, and other Financial Services & Support (Apple Pay).

Amazon delivered a strong quarter, beating analyst expectations across total revenue, AWS revenue, and EPS. The significant beat was led by strong retail sales, cost efficiencies and AWS strength. The stock jumped ~13%+ in after-hours as the market appreciated the clear AI-cloud momentum, plus incremental signs of operational efficiency with the recent lay-offs.

The pattern this week is instructive: growth alone isn_ enough as the market is increasingly focused on how growth is delivered, at what cost, and with what margin profile. Companies like Alphabet and Amazon, which showed both strong growth and clean execution, were rewarded. Meanwhile Microsoft and Meta performed well in headline metrics but triggered caution on cost and strategic clarity.

3) Federal Reserve: The Policy Pivot

The Fed_ October 29 meeting marked a clear pivot in U.S. monetary policy. The federal-funds rate was trimmed by 25 bps to 3.75%4.00%. Crucially, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) also announced it would conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings (Quantitative Tightening, or QT) on December 1, effectively stopping the contraction of the balance sheet. The vote was not unanimous, with two dissents highlighting the division within the Committee regarding the pace and necessity of the reversal.

The Committee still promises to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Inflation still remains _omewhat elevated, but the stronger signal is from the labor market: job gains have decelerated and downside risks to employment have grown.

The Committee assessed that the balance of risks has shifted toward the downside for jobs, suggesting the Fed is now more concerned about preventing a labor-market collapse than chasing every decimal of inflation. Markets are expecting further cuts, but Chair Powell explicitly cautioned that a December rate reduction is not assured. The Fed remains data-dependent, citing limited visibility due to the federal government shutdown and emphasizing that policy is _ot on a preset course.",2025-11-01T17:33:00.000Z,37,32,350,0,,neutral,1

Until recently, the modern United States had never faced a true systemic competitor.

Neither the Soviet Union nor the combined economies of Germany, Italy, and Japan during WW2 ever accounted for more than 60% of U.S. GDP. When the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in 1990, Charles Krauthammer declared America the world's only superpower, writing: ""the immediate post-Cold War world is not multipolar. It is unipolar.""

In retrospect, 2001 marked a turning point.

The U.S. supported China's admission into the WTO, hoping it would open China's market and moderate its authoritarian regime. That didn't happen. Instead, China used market access to build industrial capacity through currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and massive state subsidies.

The ""China Shock"" caused 59.3% of U.S. manufacturing job losses between 2001-2019.

Today, China makes up 28.9% of global manufacturing output compared to America's 17.2%. It produces 13 times more steel and installed more solar capacity in 2023-2024 than the U.S. has built in its entire history.

Many cite the ""Thucydides Trap"": in 12 of 16 cases over 500 years, when a rising power challenged an established one, war followed.

But a more instructive case is Britain from 1870-1914",2025-11-07T20:41:00.000Z,44,39,324,0,,neutral,0.6
https://x.com/chamath/status/1986896836523925867,@chamath,https://x.com/chamath,"In 1870, Britain produced 31.8% of the world's manufactured goods. By 1913, it produced even more in absolute terms. Yet Britain felt weaker.

What changed?

America's share jumped from 23% to 32%, and Germany's from 13% to 15%, while Britain's plummeted to 14%.

In 1914, Britain went to war with Germany. The war dragged on for four years. Britain could not defeat Germany alone. It required American industrial might to tip the balance.

What matters isn't how strong you are, but how your strength compares to others.

In some ways, the United States today stands where Britain stood in 1900.

America is still extraordinarily powerful, with an unmatched military, leading technologies, and deep cultural influence.

But China's manufacturing capacity is now 1.7x America's. Chinese builders can produce warships 200 times faster. In renewable energy infrastructure, China is deploying at a pace America hasn't matched.
For three decades after the Cold War, the U.S. operated without peer competitors. It could set rules unilaterally and shape institutions to reflect American values.

That era is ending - not because America is weak, but because China has built comparable capabilities.

This deep dive examines three questions:

1) What role does China play in the global economy and what role does it want to play?
2) Does Beijing see the U.S.-led world order as something to join, bend, or break?
3) What does the world look like if China succeeds, and if it fails?

We'll examine China's economic leverage, military capabilities, soft power operations, and the world it's building through BRICS and the AIIB.

Most importantly, we'll look through the lens that matters: relative power. You can grow stronger in absolute terms while becoming weaker in relative terms - and it's the relative balance that determines what you can accomplish.",2025-11-07T20:41:00.000Z,12,7,104,0,,positive,0

1) Elon Musk_ $1 Trillion Pay Package

Tesla shareholders have approved the largest executive compensation package in corporate history: $1 trillion in stock options for Elon Musk, contingent upon hitting a series of operational and market-cap milestones.

The plan, first proposed earlier this year and modified after legal challenges to Elon_ prior 2018 pay deal, ties Elon_ earnings to twelve escalating performance tranches.

Each tranche vests only if Tesla meets both revenue and market-capitalization targets, culminating in a total company valuation of $8.5 trillion (Tesla's current market cap today sits at ~$1.45 trillion).

The package also includes metrics tied to AI, robotics, and energy deployment, such as scaling Tesla Bot production, commercial robotaxi fleets, and high-margin software subscriptions for autonomous driving within a decade:

- 20 million vehicle deliveries
- 10 million active FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions
- 1 million bots (Optimus humanoid robots) delivered
- 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation

The approval passed with over 75% of shareholder votes in favor, signalling strong alignment with the investor base and Elon_ vision to turn Tesla into an AI-powered manufacturing and energy platform pushing forward the Robotaxi, Optimus and a chip fab build out. Tesla_ board argued the package was essential to keep Musk focused on Tesla rather than his other ventures (SpaceX, xAI, and X).

The package could add significant dilution if all tranches vest with Elon_ ownership increasing from about 13% to 25%, but supporters view it as justified by the growth required to trigger a full payout.

Hitting those targets would imply Tesla generating more annual revenue than Apple and controlling a sizable portion of the emerging robotics, autonomy, and distributed energy markets.",2025-11-08T17:06:00.000Z,30,52,690,0,,positive,0.6

Google announced a partnership with Polymarket and Kalshi to integrate real-time prediction data directly into Search and Google Finance, allowing users to see market-implied probabilities on questions ranging from election outcomes to GDP growth.

When a user searches _ho will win the 2028 election? or _ill inflation rise above 3%, they will now see probability data sourced from active markets.

Historically, Search indexed static information through news, facts, and documents, but now prediction markets offer something different: collective probability based on the real-time aggregation of belief and capital. 

By partnering with Polymarket and Kalshi, two of the most regulated and liquid forecasting platforms, Google is effectively positioning probabilistic data as a new form of knowledge signal. A shift in how Google handles truth in uncertainty by harnessing the wisdom of the crowds.

The timing also reflects growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets. Polymarket recently secured a green light from the CFTC to re-enter the U.S. market, following its acquisition of a licensed exchange, while Kalshi has pushed deeper into regulated event contracts with approval to list macroeconomic indicators.",2025-11-08T17:06:00.000Z,2,5,70,0,,neutral,1

The election saw progressive Democrat Zohran Mamdani emerge victorious with about 50.4% of the vote, defeating independent former governor Andrew Cuomo (~41.6 %) and Republican Curtis Sliwa (~7.1 %). Mamdani becomes the city_ first Muslim mayor, first of South Asian heritage, and its youngest mayor in over a century. The voter turnout exceeded 2 million, which is the highest since the 1960s.

Mamdani was able to tap into the cultural energy driven by two intertwined forces: affordability as cost-of-living pressures increased, and the generational/demographic change. Mamdani_ platform included rent freezes on stabilized units, building 200,000 more units, adding free childcare, public grocery stores and a higher-tax agenda on the wealthy. This resonated strongly in renter-heavy, diverse neighborhoods, leading to young voters, immigrant communities, and recent transplants rallying behind him.

Mamdani_ campaign displaced a former governor and captured new constituencies using the power of a social-media-first outreach, creating a populist message that grew the grassroots low-dollar donor model. This strategy won against the twenty-six billionaires that have spent at least $22 million since March to back opponents of Mamdani.

Now that Mamdani is in office, many wonder what is actually achievable. From a governance perspective, Mamdani has meaningful executive power at City Hall and can set budgets, appoint department heads, propose legislation to the City Council, and shape regulatory priorities.

However, he is constrained in several key ways. The City Council could refuse to pass his budget proposals or block legislation he needs. The State Legislature and governor hold power over tax policy, housing finance, and state-city interactions.

Trump also sees Mamdani as a communist with policies that have failed for thousands of years and can_ justify sending good money after bad.

https://x.com/chameleon_jeff/status/1977066751717429516,@chameleon_jeff,https://x.com/Darrenlautf,"TLDR: During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt. This was Hyperliquid_ first cross-margin ADL in more than 2 years of operation. ADL does not change the outcome for any liquidated users. While some specific ADL providing trades were unfavorable, the aggregate effect of ADL was that traders realized significant pnl by closing positions at favorable prices that were only briefly available. 

--

It_ sad to see some people attack Hyperliquid to deflect from their own platforms issues. Solvency and uptime are the two most important properties of a financial system. These are table stakes for any trading system, and gaslighting to convince users otherwise is unethical and irresponsible.

Below is more analysis on how Hyperliquid_ margining system handled the extreme volatility.

Background on liquidations

For a perps system to be solvent, every position must be backed by a minimum amount of collateral. This is called the _aintenance margin. When positions do not meet the maintenance margin requirement, they are taken over by the system to be liquidated. Earlier today, many altcoins dropped by more than 50% in a short period of time. When this happens, long positions at 2x or higher leverage must be liquidated, or else the system accrues bad debt.

There were billions of dollars worth of positions liquidated on Hyperliquid in a matter of minutes. In a permissionless system, each user chooses their own position sizing and collateralization. Any system that does not liquidate the necessary users is irresponsibly gambling with other users funds. On Hyperliquid, every order, trade, and liquidation is transparently verifiable onchain. Many other venues significantly under-report liquidation data. This cannot be compared apples-to-apples against the fully onchain picture of Hyperliquid.

Background on HLP

HLP is a protocol vault with permissionless deposits that 1) provides order book liquidity and 2) performs backstop liquidations. The first role is negligible, with HLP trading less than 1% market share. The focus of this post is liquidations.

Liquidations are first attempted against the order book, and any user can provide liquidity to these market liquidations. Backstop liquidations occur when the order book does not have enough liquidity to absorb an undercollateralized position. In this case, HLP takes over the position along with its collateral. For improved risk management, HLP is split into several child vaults, and each liquidation is only sent to one child vault.

Background on ADL

Auto-deleveraging (ADL) is the liquidation mechanism of last resort, when market and backstop liquidations do not work. See Doug_ thread (link in reply) for a thorough explanation on the details of ADL.

Every ADL event has two sides: the _riggered side is undercollateralized, while the _roviding side is decided as a function of profitability and leverage used.

Similar to backstop liquidations, even though providers to ADL are profitable on average, there are no guarantees for any specific event. Some ADL providing trades were unfavorable, such as when only some components of long/short portfolio were closed. The system is designed to minimize ADLs because they are unpredictable even if ADL providing trades are profitable on average. Because HLP is a non-toxic backstop liquidator, ADL is a rare settlement of last resort. As far as I know, this was the first cross-margin ADL event on Hyperliquid mainnet (ADL is more common for isolated-only assets such as hyperps, which are not backstop liquidated by HLP).

Summary of events

Over the course of 20 minutes, HLP backstop liquidated billions of dollars worth of positions.

HLP's philosophy has always been to provide liquidity of last resort. Contrary to misconceptions, HLP is a non-toxic liquidator that does not pick profitable liquidations. Instead HLP is a public good for maintaining system solvency. In particular, Hyperliquid has no liquidation fees. HLP_ design, including its multi-component child vault system, is the product of countless simulations, and allows HLP to maximally serve the benefit of the protocol while managing its own risk.

In fact, the liquidator child vaults of HLP themselves became undercollateralized in the course of backstop liquidating as many user positions as possible. This is by design, where child vaults are isolated from the other components of the overall strategy. HLP is treated no differently from other users when participating in ADL. In aggregate, HLP's child vaults were the largest addresses on the triggered side of ADL by more than an order of magnitude. The addresses on the providing side of ADL against HLP_ child vaults realized hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profit relative to the prices shortly before and after the dislocation.

On other venues, the liquidation engine is not transparent and therefore may not be subject to the same strict margin requirements as for normal users. On these venues, the exchange could have backstop liquidated more positions, bearing increased solvency risk to extract hundreds of millions in business revenue. This is not an acceptable tradeoff for Hyperliquid.

Finally, I know that this is a difficult time for many traders, and I hope the community can continue to support each other and grow together. As a contributor to Hyperliquid, I_l continue to work my hardest to build the best possible platform that can house all of finance. Times like this highlight the importance of transparency and fairness in the financial system.",2025-10-11T17:40:00.000Z,838,1075,5463,0,,neutral,1

Yes, drinking water actually burns calories. Did you know that when you drink 1 liter of water, your body burns 35 calories? 

So let's assume an average intake of 3 to 4 liters, you will easily burn 100 calories on top of your normal expenditure. How that works is that your body reduces the temperature of the water to the body's core temperature, and that actually burns calories. So if you ever needed any incentive to stay hydrated, think about that. 

And whenever you are trying to go into a calorie deficit, think about increasing a little bit your water intake. Not only that it creates volume in your stomach, making you less hungry, it actually burns calories.

It feels like someone got hit very hard and will see a large body float to the surface soon, reminds me a little of summer 2021. 

Good reminder to myself to own things that I am actually bullish on, and not things I am trying to shift on momentum. Some charts look like they_l never recover, whereas some things look buyable for the first time in a while. 

When everyone is making hilarious amounts of money I am always tempted to start using leverage again. It is almost impossible to fight the feeling that you_e not making enough, or everyone else is outpacing you. Good reminder that fighting that feeling and avoid the wipeouts is worth it in the end. 

Check on your friends, likely a bad day for many.

Personally, am concentrating my bags into the things I am happy to own for the next few years, and shedding the fat. Realised I own some assets based on not wanting to miss out, rather than on some actual thesis. Days like today are much easier for me if I think my bags will bounce back, and much worse if I_ losing money owning things I don_ even believe in. 

Don_ let a leverage blowup dictate your long-term views. The future is bright, good things to come, patience is rewarded.

https://x.com/cobie/status/1979787487720640862,@cobie,https://x.com/cburniske,"When ppl claim this I always wonder how they think it happens, or have unrealistic expectations on how much $1bn actually is. 

I joined crypto with $200. If I held my initial bitcoin since then and never traded, I would have ~$300k.

If, instead, from that moment I sold the top and bought the bottom of every crypto cycle on Bitcoin, and never paid any taxes, I would have ~$6m USD.

If I put my entire net worth into the Ethereum ICO and never touched it, today I would have ~$150m pre-tax. 

While it was definitely possible to have made >$1bn with the opportunities in the market, these versions of reality would also require me to make no mistakes, and have no need to spend $ in real life, or take excessive risk via leverage. 

In reality, I grew up in a working class family. I didn_ have a trust fund and I had to pay off my student loan myself. I had a job at Tescos while at high school.  After university, I needed to pay rent and fund cost of living and eventually buy a place to live. 

I worked at startups for relatively little $ salary, and while a couple have done okay, they still are illiquid and worth nothing until some exit. 

Perhaps if I erase a couple of dumb mistakes and drawdowns, or if I had a lil more grind, then my answer would be different today. But it is easy to say this with perfect hindsight vision. It_ easy to see where you could have optimised better, and decisions you made look dumb when the past makes things so obvious. 

The truth is I have always optimised for enjoying my life and not going to 0. I never felt like I had a safety net, so it was never possible for me to do anything in any other way. I would probably have less money if I had tried to add more risk or chased $ harder, because being all-in with your entire livelihood is a mental battle and I feel I only win that battle when the stakes are lower. 

In writing this, maybe I do understand why CT folks believe this, because modern CT sees crypto as a late-stage lottery ticket farm, where the optimal strategy is to 5x leverage up your portfolio in a hope of catching a good 20% move and then leaving. Or, literally going all-in on the next coin they heard Ansem is buying. So perhaps to them, looking back at the charts, of course that_ what successful folks did. 

In reality, I use leverage close to never (and typically to reduce risk rather than add risk  have used it to add risk maybe 3 times in the last 5 years, and maybe 15 times ever). I never go all-in on anything, have only ever done that on BTC and ETH before in the last decade. When I buy other things, I limit risk to tiny amounts, because I treat it as a 0 until proven otherwise (so, always <1% liquid portfolio). Liquid portfolio is also a smaller % of overall portfolio to future-proof against my own fuckups. 

Obviously I made a lot of money, I have been here 12 years! CT doesn_ want to hear about _etting rich in a decade though. I am happy with where I am and have never really cared or optimised for maximising $ earnings, but instead having a nice life that lets me enjoy the game we play together.",2025-10-19T05:51:00.000Z,979,1884,15872,1,BTC,neutral,1

If there is one thing you should take away from this it's that the ""dino coins are dead"" guys are wrong.

I don't know much about $ZEC but I can tell you for a fact that the ""tech"" didn't magically get 20x better over the last 6 months. 

6 months ago $ZEC was just another ""dino"" coin that was ""dead"" and today its the second coming of Bitcoin apparently. 

4 years of bearish PA wiped out in a few months- and now other ""dinos"" in the sector are following suit. 

Take this and then extrapolate it to every other niche when the times comes. Leaders in gaming, defi, AI, etc will at one point catch a bid and then the chase begins across the board.

That will be your alt season and with 20x more money in the system than we had in 2017 it will be even bigger.",2025-11-05T20:46:00.000Z,103,60,936,0,,negative,0

Just spent 200,000 of these points (cost $2,875) to book my roundtrip business class flights to Japan.

Cash cost for this same round trip ticket was over $10,000, so I saved over $7,000 on these tickets alone.

Even with other, cheaper airlines (that have somewhat similar business class experiences) the cheapest ""equivalent"" was between $3,000-$4,000 one way (7-8k roundtrip).

In total, ended up getting $15,000-$20,000 of value in business class international flights for $5,500.

The goal of this series is to be a starting point for new traders. As such, initial topics and lessons will be aim to be simple, short and easily digestible. We will get into more complex topics once the initial set of videos and intro for beginners is complete. 

Will now be working on the graphics/visuals for the lesson and this may take some time.

Once I get more familiar with this new process I should be able to pump these out a lot faster and more frequently.

We get one pullback after a near 100% rally to new ATH and people are already throwing in the towel which is funny to see.

On the other hand- we know that ETH is just pulling back after a clean, 5 wave impulse off of our lows, and we know what follows this is an even more explosive move to the upside that should take us to 10k+. 

But first, the current correction needs to complete.

Looking at the ETH/BTC chart specifically- I've previously commented on how I would like to have seen a test of HTF supply above us, and we still haven't gotten that yet. 

We are currently holding a lower TF area of demand, but the HTF zone that I am most interested in is the GREEN zone between .021 and .026. 

That is, imo, the best R/R ratio for loading up on $ETH, wherever it may be in USD terms.

We know that Wave 2's can take some time, as these corrections are essentially building a base for the 3rd wave which should be extremely strong, so ideally we get a sort of expanded flat corrective structure here- giving us some relief to the upside (and a ""fake"" reversal) before coming down to the higher TF zone for the ""real"" reversal. 

Of course if we move up off the current zone in an impulsive manner, OR if we break this lower TF demand zone now and head to the higher TF zone below sooner rather than later, then our next impulse will begin sooner rather than later.

For now will continue to watch PA develop and ideally get a chance to build an $ETH position between .021-.026.",2025-11-13T19:33:00.000Z,66,66,632,1,BTC,neutral,1

So the question was- ""Cred, what if we hit 74k, confirming our $BTC top in in fact in?""

And my response was: ""If that's the case, then our alt season comes sooner rather than later.""

As I have stated many times, the biggest alt season is expected to happen post $BTC top, NOT before.

The quoted tweet was then the response which basically asked ""why would we see an alt season if we haven't seen one yet despite the ""top"" being in (hypothetically, assuming 74k is breached).""

My chart below is a response to that, let's take a look:

In 2017, after our last cycle ended, Bitcoin topped at the GREEN dotted line at 20k on December 17th. 

Bitcoin then dropped 50% to 10k denoted by the RED dotted line.

After THIS point, following a 50% drop on Bitcoin post BTC top, we had our MASSIVE alt season which sent total alt marketcap from 170B (the day BTC hit 10k) to nearly 500B, or 3x off the lows, and new ATH.

The major alt season of 2017 that everyone so fondly remembers, didn't actually begin until AFTER BTC had topped AND corrected 50% off the highs.

So hypothetically, even if $BTC has topped and 74k is breached, (playing devils advocate here, I don't expect this to happen) no, I am not selling my alts and yes, we will still see the greatest alt season of the decade imo and that won't change even if BTC corrects significantly off the highs first.",2025-11-13T21:03:00.000Z,134,126,1045,1,BTC,positive,0

And this is not a new idea but one that I have been consistent on for a long time.

The clip below is from one of my Youtube videos that was shared on my Youtube channel 9 months ago- back when Bitcoin was trading just under 100k and many were saying that the ""cycle top was in"". 

In this sub 2 minute clip I break down my expectations if the top WAS in (I also said I didn't believe this to be the case) and shared why even if our top was in I would still expect our massive alt season.

Of course, our top was in fact NOT in, and we went on to make a fresh impulse off the 74k level. That being said, the same logic I applied at that time can be applied to today's situation if we were to assume once again that the top is already in (and again, I don't believe it is). 

Bottom line- whether the top is in or not- it doesn't change the fact that the best is yet to come for alts as I have repeated for years now that the biggest alt season will come post $BTC top, whether that is NOW or after $BTC climbs higher, somewhere above 150k+ (which is my expectation as long as 74k is not breached).",2025-11-14T00:05:00.000Z,75,78,965,1,BTC,neutral,0.2

L2s keep growing, but without routing more value back to mainnet, ETH_ long-term security incentives start looking shaky.

@AFDudley0 suggests enshrining cross-L2 swaps & ETH as L2 gas, but VC pushback makes it tricky.

Does Ethereum need a stronger economic model to align L2 adoption with ETH demand, or does it just become a high-fee settlement layer?

Venture is mainly about founder qualities and archetypes. Many so-called _Gs in crypto are slowly fading out, which is a normal part of the adoption cycle of the space. It_ basically losing many of its tinkerers  those who are mainly interested in technical challenges. There are still sub sectors where thinkers can drive in crypto. 

The big secular upside lies in betting on evangelists who can evolve into strong integrators. I_ thinking of the second term of Steve Jobs at Apple. Many of those types of founders can now be found in liquid markets, and in our view founders like @kaiynne will have staying power to last for decades. 

As a venture firm, you want to find great integrators. People like @santiagoroel  who understand the state of the technology and can apply first principled business logic to it. 

Crypto today is very different from the past, and the principles of investing or the pure momentum trading many have learned so far will not apply going forward.

Currently Ethereum is making almost zero fees from both L1 and L2 transactions *because it chooses to*: If we were a company, we would put a reasonable price tag on transactions, and raise it when there is congestion. But instead, we currently charge very close to zero for transactions and DA when there is no congestion, and the result is there is almost zero fees. Looks bad when you want to evaluate Ether based on that!

But here comes the more tricky part: In its current form, it may well be that Ethereum DA does not have much of a moat. It provides very little UX benefits, and only very abstract security benefits that will probably be very closely replicated by alt-DA. Therefore, the moat for DA is low and it's likely Ethereum will never charge significant fees over a long time period.

So what should be the plan? My best guess is:
 - scale L1 to make sure that integration with Ethereum remains attractive
 - scale DA to make sure that we lower the incentives for alt-DA (this doesn't have to mean lower fees. We can just charge a fee!)
 - work on shorter block times, single-slot L2 interop etc. to maximize value of Ethereum DA",2025-03-13T20:09:00.000Z,127,107,817,0,,negative,-0.2

While both bills are an improvement on the Howey-based regime_hich is notoriously difficult to apply and creates toxic perverse incentives for issuers_he Senate draft is significantly simpler, and avoids forcing decentralized tokens and protocols to fit themselves into an inflexible legislative framework.

Instead, it protects against abuse with a simple exclusion_ssets that come with legal rights to specified financial interests do not qualify as ancillary assets.

Exhausting to see the hate against Jews rise from every corner of the world, and from people who have no connection to the Middle East whatsoever. These very people who have never felt outrage for real atrocities taking place all around the world. No Jews, no news. 

Exhausting to see these very people being fed manufactured lies parroted and amplified by every mainstream media as fact, and believing the propaganda turning aggressors into victims. 

Exhausting to hear words that have no place in this conflict like genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing  crafted by terrorists and their henchmen  in the mouths of an entire generation in the West and across our _lite university campuses.

Exhausting to watch Western civilizations and governments committing suicide by aligning themselves with groups and ideology that seek to destroy the Judeo-Christian and Western way of life. It starts with the Jews, and ends with the rest of you

It_ exhausting to be a Jew these days. 

But then you think of your brothers and sisters fighting and risking their lives every day to return our hostages, and to ensure Israel continues to exist forever, and you find the energy again to fight in your own ways. Again, and again. Because you know right from wrong.

Takenos has reached a level of PMF with real world adoption that has long been the holy grail of crypto companies. They have consistently been a top 5 app in Bolivia in the App Store (yes, all apps, not just crypto apps) - at times, even more popular than ChatGPT.

Unlike many LATAM fintechs focused on the _ig three markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, Takenos is winning across the long tail - countries like Bolivia and Peru that have been traditionally neglected by both banking and fintechs alike.

The founders, Lucas, Francisco, Joaquín, Simón, are builders in the truest sense: hands-on, resourceful and willing to relocate their entire team to each new market they enter.

https://x.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1985768151867433113,@DeFi_Dad,https://x.com/CamiRusso,"Here's a few insights on what I think is happening and how it's likely to affect us all as DeFi lenders and borrowers in the comings days/weeks...

+ First there is the Balancer exploit, one that hit a very trusted protocol and wiped out $128M. That money is gone for good, and its lasting impact is just fear of what happens if I'm exploited in a blue chip protocol. But I don't think this matters as much as others think. Maybe smarter money will purchase cover from Nexus Mutual to sleep better at night, after having assumed they were safe in more trusted protocols with a clean track record. 

+ In terms of Morpho / Euler style vault protocols, they are working as intended. They will take some heat cuz everyone loves to point the finger the minute they fuck up with their own money but truth is, Morpho/Euler were never about curating markets, they just allow for maximum freedom to access markets built on their protocol.

+ What's happened in the last year is that there were too many vaults being created by curators IMO. The market demanded isolated markets for more long tail assets and the curators were there to meet the demand. I am a proponent of having this ungated access to any/all markets, let users decide where they deploy, and if they blow themselves lending to shit borrowers, so be it. I don't want anyone to tell me what I should or shouldn't have access to. Onchain, we decide but with great power, comes great responsibility, responsibility to know what the fuck you're lending to.

+ Morpho, Euler, Silo, Gearbox, etc all provide powerful tools and templates for creating a lending/borrowing market, often but not always stamped with some approval by a curator who carries whatever credibility to say ""this market has been vetted by us, we're not guaranteeing it's always safe or that you'll enjoy instant liquidity to withdraw, but we are clearly, kind of endorsing you should be able to lend and withdraw when necessary, and borrowers should enjoy competitive (maybe even underpriced) borrowing rates for their favorite collateral. Collaterals no one else could support in shared pooled money markets like Aave.""

+ Now that someone finally blew up on bad collateral, that means there's lenders who are going to incur real losses, as they should as painful as that may be. But the curators are not just curators, they also run liquid strategies themselves and act as lenders/borrowers who have benefitted from artificially low DeFi interest rates in good times. They move massive amounts of liquidity vault to vault, allowing them to maintain competitive borrowing rates, rates that they and other parties use to loop for very profitable yields.

For example, if you were holding a Pendle PT with a fixed APY of 15%, the ability to borrow at 86.5% LTV, at 6-10%, is pretty awesome! Just deposit the PT, borrow maximum USDC, swap on Pendle for more PT, deposit PT, and repeat until you achieve about 6-7x leverage, resulting in a net yield of ~50+% APY.

+ The problem is now that there's a real loss among stablecoin lenders for those who were lending to xUSD collateralized borrowers, and for those who straight up held xUSD, there's some panic to withdraw from other markets, a realization that there's some real risk, even though nearly all of these existing isolated markets have zero exposure to the damage from xUSD. Nearly all these loopers can unwind positions, safely. And as they do, certain lenders might choose to withdraw for whatever reason they have (fear, panic, worry over contagion).

+ So with that desire to exit other markets, there's a demand that suddenly cannot be met without borrowers paying back their debt, but with so much looping, many of the largest lenders are also borrowers, because they were looping too.

+ That means, we will simply see more market participants, including curators who are running their own liquid strategies, unwind their looped stablecoin positions. In order for that to happen, interest rates had to spike on many of these isolate markets to scare loopers / incentivize them out of their positions.

+ I woke up this morning to a few of my own looped up positions, which although they were safe and unexposed to any of the xUSD debacle, the markets were suddenly 100% utilized because other lenders have withdrawn excess stablecoin liquidity to either exit completely or move to other markets.

+ For someone like me in a looped PT-stablecoin position, it's not a big deal, just means my looping is no longer profitable as I earn 15-20% fixed on collateral while borrowing at 30-40% in debt so I'll unwind it by withdrawing PT collateral, swapping back to USDC, paying back my USDC, withdrawing more PT collateral, etc. As I do so, it will free up capital for lenders to withdraw, even though I'm a small fish in a big pond.

+ There's nothing to stop me from unwinding right now, it just takes a few mins of effort and my guess is bigger money is doing the same thing because there's no more certainty that rates will return back down and the same liquidity will generously be allocated by MMs/curators to sustain lower interest rates in these curated markets.

TLDR: I am optimistic that we have come a long way since 2021/2022 and despite a number of blow-ups yet to surface from Oct 10th and the lost money from this xUSD meltdown, a lot of this is relatively safe stablecoin leverage that was flying high due to mispriced borrowing rates, and so now it needs to unwind a bit. 

My advice is if you're not 100% certain of what you're lending to or exposed to, or you just have trouble sleeping on any exposure, just unwind it and exit. I exited leveraged PT looping in profit. If you looped up with locked in higher PT rates, that's a consideration too but for the most part, there's always more Pendle PT lending opportunities so exiting now shouldn't weigh too much on you.

Today, I'm thrilled to announce we_e leading the Series B for BVNK. Joining us in this round are Coinbase, Tiger Global, and many other institutional, and angel investors. 

We believe stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in financial rails of the past few decades, and BVNK is a global leader in stablecoin payment infrastructure.

With the stablecoin market now processing $25.1 trillion annually, we believe their momentum to be undeniable. Legacy systems like SWIFT and SEPA, built decades ago, no longer seem sufficient to meet the demands of a fast-moving, interconnected global economy. Meanwhile, stablecoins offer a stepwise change in speed, transparency, and cost efficiency.
BVNK is not just participating in this transformation_t_ helping to lead the way.

The promise of crypto has long been to build faster, fairer, and more inclusive financial systems. BVNK is creating infrastructure that bridges the gap between fiat and stablecoin ecosystems, thereby enabling  businesses like Deel, Rapyd, and Trust Payments, to send, receive, and settle payments seamlessly, regardless of currency or geography.

We_e thrilled to partner with @donald_jackson @jessehs @chrisharmse89, and the entire BVNK team as they continue to expand their global footprint, bringing internet-speed payments to businesses worldwide. This team has been building for over five years, through multiple crypto cycles, and brings real business building skills to this challenge. Their growth has been commensurate with their skills, and we_e excited to help them tackle new markets.

We_e just at the beginning of this new payment era, and BVNK will be a key player in this next chapter, working to redefine how money moves globally. Sounds interesting? Join in on the fun -> @BVNKFinance",2024-12-17T15:06:00.000Z,8,12,151,0,,neutral,0

It_ coming from a strategy game quietly built on Polygon and it_ almost mobile-ready. Its name is @MedievalEmpires.

Every week, the loop gets tighter.
Every week, the players get smarter.
And now, with iOS and Android around the corner, Medieval Empires feels ready to cross from a niche Web3 experiment into a global game.

I_e been playing since the days you had to download the client manually, praying the upgrades wouldn_ freeze mid-battle.

And while the market looks red, this is exactly when conviction pays off.
Because once the mobile rollout begins, demand for $MEE will rise fast:
VIPs need it for staking.
New players need it for upgrades.
Veterans use it to compound progress.

If you_e already been playing, now_ the time to DCA quietly.
Cycles reward patience especially when you_e early on something real.

1. Stack Silver Early
Silver is your economy.
Before you train or upgrade anything, build your reserves.
In this world, whoever controls silver controls speed.

2. Save Your Speed-Ups
Don_ waste them on random upgrades.
Save them for weekly missions and leaderboard resets that_ where the real MEE rewards are.

3. Rotate Units Strategically
Units last around 50 battles.
Don_ retire them early.
Time your rotations with event cycles efficiency wins wars.

4. Land and Tax Strategy
Pick your plot wisely.
Lower taxes = more resources in your pocket.
Even in Medieval times, smart tax policy wins.

5. Stake MEE Upgrade VIP
This is where most players slip.
VIP staking isn_ just cosmetic it_ the backbone of your growth.

It gives you:
 Cheaper unit training
 Faster build times
 Extra army slots
 Higher event bonuses

And all of it runs on MEE sitting around a $10M market cap, early.

6. The People Behind I
That_ what keeps me bullish.
The devs ship weekly. They have @LucBerkefeld. Big accounts and Community leaders like @TheMoonCarl keep pushing it forward.
And the players? They_e here to stay.

That kind of alignment between gamers, creators, and long-term investors is exactly what Web3 was supposed to look like.

7. The Timing
Outside the game, the market_ bleeding.
Inside, progress compounds.
You can build, expand, and stack resources before millions join through mobile.
This is the kind of window people only notice after it closes.

You can wait for the headlines or start building before they arrive.

Because once Medieval Empires goes fully mobile, everything changes:
new players, new markets, and a new spotlight for Polygon and Immutable gaming.",2025-11-05T12:48:00.000Z,12,14,47,0,,neutral,1

I_e been stacking on the lows, adding more to my position, and honestly it_ still the only crypto game I_ fully invested in.
The fundamentals are there: a live game, active players, mobile rollout in progress and a token with actual in-game demand.

This week, I_e been grinding everything straight from my phone while in the Big Apple.

The new mobile version made it easy to manage towns, train units, and do my dailies on the go.

Next week will be even more intense make sure you finish your missions early and stack resources before the leaderboard resets.

Feels like this month is the quiet accumulation phase before everything goes public once the mobile release hits iOS and Android, the exposure and token demand will only go higher.

Because every player who wants faster progress, cheaper upgrades, or VIP perks will need MEE.

Words like laser, scuba, radar began uppercase.

LASER  Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
SCUBA  Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
RADAR  RAdio Detection And Ranging

When a technology matures and becomes reliable, trusted, commoditised, it earns the lowercase. Lean Ethereum is a bet on snarks, not Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge.

Post-quantum security. Provable soundness. End-to-end formal verification. Deep cryptanalysis. Real-time proving. zkVM programmability. Simplicity and elegance. All essential for the lowercase. All inevitable.

Ethereum L1 has 10y uptime and $1T secured with hashes and signatures, our cryptographic workhorses. I believe in 100y uptime and $1Q secured with snarks, our cryptographic jet engines.

 * L1 scale  10K TPS gigagas scale with real-time zkEVMs 
 * L1 security  post-quantum security with snarked signatures
 * L1 privacy  Zcash-grade stealth with wormholes (eg EIP-7503)

Shipping snarks is a cryptographic Manhattan Project, one the EF is investing tens of millions into:

 * verified-zkevm[.]org  formal verification
 * poseidon-initiative[.]info  deep cryptanalysis
 * ethproofs[.]org  real-time proving
 * proximityprize[.]org  provable soundness
 * zkevm.ethereum[.]foundation  enshrinement
 * pse[.]dev  privacy
 
Step by step, the EF is evolving into a snark-first org:

 * cryptography team  driving soundness and cryptanalysis 
 * snarkification team  driving formal verification
 * zkEVM team  driving protocol integration
 * Ethproofs team  driving real-time proving

Devcon, Bangkok  Nov 12, 2024. The suspense is real. The room overflows; hundreds can't get in. An ""announcement of an announcement"" had sparked wild speculation about my ""most ambitious initiative"".

Who knew the beam chain vision would evolve into lean Ethereum? Next-level ambition, seeping into all layers of L1. Snarks for consensus and execution. Fort mode and beast mode.

What's new? zkEVMs. Real-time proving. Full validation in a tab, on a phone. Let's pump L1 gas with the exponential snark curve. Starting in months, not years. To me it all points to 10K TPS, the gigagas frontier.

Stablecoins are exploding. They move trillions every year and are rapidly becoming the backbone of global finance. They rival Visa and Mastercard in settlement volume and are on track to surpass them. RWAs are thriving, merging with DeFi in ways we previously only dreamed of.

These innovations are the bridge between fiat and crypto. Stablecoins will become the settlement layer of DeFi.  They are the clearest path to mainstream crypto adoption.

As stablecoins expand into payments, remittances, and even, one day, sovereign currencies, the foundations that enable them must evolve. The industry and its partners need speed, predictability, compliance, and connectivity.

This is what sets Avalanche apart.
Avalanche delivers fast finality, low fees, and decoupled horizontal scalability without compromising on the most core tenant of our movement, decentralization. Most importantly, Avalanche introduces custom Layer 1 blockchains with native interoperability: sovereign chains built for specific use cases, natively connected to the wider Avalanche network.

Avalanche Layer 1s allow institutions to embed compliance and KYC at the protocol level. Payment providers can optimize for performance, their most critical design constraint. Central banks can configure specially tailored monetary policy. And because of Avalanche Interchain Messaging (ICM), all these diverse Layer 1s can interoperate seamlessly with one another and thus with public permissionless DeFi applications as well.

The direction our world is heading is clear: stablecoins will soon surpass credit cards in settlement volume, CBDCs will launch on blockchain networks, and many institutions will choose to operate their products, markets, and rails on Avalanche Layer 1s.

Stablecoins and institutional adoption are the most powerful forces in crypto today and Avalanche is the infrastructure purposefully built to carry them into a future where global finance runs onchain.

_ think we're headed to a radically different world. I think a good world, an interesting world. My prediction actually for humanoid robots is that ultimately there will be tens of billions. I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2 but even better. Who wouldn't want to have their own personal C-3PO-R2-D2? That would be pretty great.

I also think it unlocks an immense amount of economic potential because when you think about what is the output of an economy, it is productivity per capita times population or capita. Once you have humanoid robots, the actual economic output potential is tremendous. It's really unlimited.

Potentially, we could have an economy 10 times the size of the current global economy where no one wants for anything. You know, sometimes in AI they talk about universal basic income. I think it's actually going to be universal high income where anyone can have any goods or services that they want.

https://x.com/ElonTrades/status/1977340254047649966,@ElonTrades,https://x.com/CryptoHayes,"The Oct 11 Crypto Crash  What Really Happened

TL;DR:

Roughly $6090M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance_ own order-book data instead of external oracles.

That localized depeg triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations, cascaded into $19B+ globally, and earned the attackers about $192M via $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts opened on Hyperliquid hours earlier, but minutes before Trump tariff announcement.

It wasn_ a USDe failure!! It was Binance_ design flaw, timed with macro panic (Trump_ tariffs) for cover.

What looked like chaos was actually a coordinated exploitation of Binance_ internal pricing system, amplified by a macro shock and systemic leverage.

1�__ The Setup

Binance_ Unified Account let traders use assets like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL as collateral.

Instead of oracle or redemption prices, Binance valued these using its own spot market - a major vulnerability.

On Oct 6, Binance announced a fix to move to oracle-based pricing, but rollout wasn_ until Oct 14, leaving an 8-day window.

2�__ The Exploit

During that window, sophisticated actors manipulated Binance_ order books, dumping ~$6090M of USDe, driving it to $0.65 on Binance only (still ~$1 elsewhere).

Because the Unified Account marked collateral to internal prices, this instantly wiped margin value and triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations.

Then, Trump_ 100% China tariff headline hit, magnifying panic and liquidity stress.

3�__ The Profit Engine

The same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts, funded by $110M USDC from Arbitrum-linked sources.

As the Binance cascade unfolded, BTC and ETH cratered, those shorts netted $192M in profit before closing out at the bottom.

Timing, precision, and funding paths all suggest coordination.

4�__ The Contagion

Binance liquidations dumped BTC/ETH/ALTs into thin books.

Other exchanges mirrored the collapse through cross-market bots.

Market makers hedged across venues were forced to unwind everywhere.

Result: $19B+ global liquidations, with many alts down 5070% intraday, all triggered by <$100M of manipulated collateral.

5�__ Who_ at fault?

Binance: design flaw + delay in oracle rollout = root cause.

Exploiters: executed and timed the manipulation, profited via external shorts.

Ethena (USDe): not at fault - protocol stayed 1:1 collateralized, redemptions normal, peg held everywhere else.

6�__ Aftermath

Binance admitted _latform-related issues, promised compensation for affected margin/futures/loan users, and rolled out minimum price floors + oracle integration.

USDe remained operational, and the incident is now a case study in how exchange-side pricing errors can trigger system-wide liquidations.

Bottom line:
A ~$90M dump on Binance and a $1.1B leveraged short elsewhere sparked a $19B bloodbath.

Not a stablecoin failure, but a masterclass in exploiting flawed collateral valuation during peak macro stress.",2025-10-12T11:47:00.000Z,684,2162,8890,1,BTC,neutral,-1

Why? Because it conflicts with itself under any examination. It is a self-defeating assertion of morality.

You have a right to yourself, and to that which you can acquire without violating the same right of others. 

You have a right to your body, to your speech and your thoughts, to sunshine in the day and darkness at night, to your own ideas and that which you teach yourself, and to the air you breathe. If you grow your own food, of course you have a right to it. If something is given or taught to you freely, you have a right to that as well. So far, no violation of the same right in others. Consistent moral harmony.  

But you do not have a right to food that isn't voluntarily given to you, just because you're hungry.  Nor to healthcare or education, when it must be provided by another person involuntarily. 

Why? Because if you did, it would violate the very right you're presuming of yourself: namely, the right to your body and the product of it.  To demand another provide for you is to violate the principle of your own self-ownership. A contradiction in claim. 

If I can grow my own food and it is mine, then my neighbor cannot claim any right to take it from me.  He may ask, and if he's starving I should provide help as a good human, but there is no moral claim which should forcefully compel me. Again, if there was, then the fundamental right is now in conflict with itself. And if my neighbor has no right to seize my bread by force, he certainly doesn't have the right to enlist politicians to do so on his behalf, regardless of how many friends he can find to ""vote"" for the same. 

Needless to say, those who claim we have a right to food taken by force from others never define the limits of a such a right because it's based on absurdity from the start. *Which* food do you have a right to?  How much of it? Must it be organic? You have a right to healthcare?  Okay, how much of that, and from which Doctor? Do you have a right to band-aids and vitamins? To MRI machines? To the best MRI machine or only last year's model?  Such claims of right become preposterous upon any examination. 

Good ethics should not be contradictory on topics so fundamental to civilization.  You cannot have a right to the product of others.

1/ Bhutan becomes the first nation to anchor its national digital ID system on Ethereum, showing how governments can use open infrastructure to keep public identity systems secure, sovereign, and verifiable.

2/ @JovayNetwork by Ant Group (creator of AliPay) are building the next era of Layer 2, connecting one of the world_ largest payment networks with open, global infrastructure.

3/ Stablecoin transfers on @ethereum hit $5T last quarter. Onchain payments continue to become the internet_ settlement layer for global value.

4/ ERC-8004 went live, enabling AI agents to discover and trust each other without intermediaries, a step toward open, autonomous agent economies built on Ethereum.

5/ @ADIChain_ joined the @zksync Elastic Network, launching the first dirham-backed stablecoin with major UAE banks, a strong link between regulated finance and open settlement infrastructure.

6/ @centrifuge launched SPXA, the first tokenized S&P 500 Index Fund licensed by @SPDJIndices and deployed on @base, bringing traditional market exposure directly into the onchain economy.

7/ The Ethereum for Institutions site is now live. The new site acts as a resource for builders, leaders, and institutions.

8/ @WalletConnect Pay went live with @dtc_pay, enabling seamless stablecoin payments across retail and hospitality in Asia, bridging onchain money with everyday transactions.

9/ @Lighter_xyz launched its mainnet after eight months in private beta, bringing low-cost, low-latency perpetual trading to Ethereum L2 with verifiable matching and liquidations for high-performance DeFi.

10/ @fluidkey launched its new app on iOS, Android, and web, combining privacy-preserving accounts, stealth addresses, yield, swaps, and biometric security in one onchain wallet.

11/ @brevis_zk unveiled Pico Prism, a zkVM proving 99.6% of blocks in under 12 seconds with 64 RTX 5090 GPUs, showing how zero-knowledge (ZK) performance is accelerating.

12/ @ziskvm now proves every Ethereum block in real time, averaging 7.5-second proofs, supporting the network in delivering secure scalability.

13/ @Securitize and @FGNexusio brought the first NASDAQ-listed equity fully onchain, turning dividend-paying shares into programmable assets. Public markets are starting to use Ethereum as their base layer.

14/ Ethereum is now the main capital hub of @zksync. ZKsync introduced the Atlas upgrade which makes it faster to move funds between L1 and L2. This means institutional and RWA asset flows can use directly Ethereum L1 as a liquidity hub.

15/ Applications on @ethereum now host over $360B in deposits, up $100B this year.

16/ Layer 2 networks on @ethereum processed 1.4B transactions in Q3, a new record. Showing how scaling solutions are working to bring Ethereum to millions of users.

17/ @RobinhoodApp_EU Stock Tokens went live in the EU. There are 400+ Stock Tokens linked to U.S. stocks and ETFs, giving retail investors onchain access to traditional markets.

Paradigm is particular good at this. Subgoals include progressing the systems of the world towards rigorous decentralization, credibly neutrality, censorship resistance, and intrinsic privacy/confidentiality to the extent that such a world is more profitable -- and healthy in other ways -- for themselves and their investors.

As @fede_intern indicated, it is not news that Paradigm has been working to ""own"" Ethereum for years._ That said, I don't believe there is reason for concern, and consider this kind of behavior natural and inevitable. And the gold rush of corpo-chains is validating for the traditional economy and signals our mainstreaming._ Yes, I would prefer that Mallesh and Dankrad would focus their talent and energies fully on Ethereum. But both probably do need a fresh context to energize them, and since both are pure researchers, I expect they will continue to write papers and contribute broadly, as they indicated they would.

We need VCs for now because they represent a comfortable bridge for the world's capital to flow into our ecosystem. Very soon better, fairer, more broadly accessible onchain investment platforms with healthy tokenomics will mature sufficiently so that VCs will have no choice but to set up shop on these platforms, if they want to stay in the game. In bringing progressive decentralization to everything -- even up through layers of identity, reputation and governance -- we are on the precipice of totally changing the way the world works.

Ethereum will win -- already has won -- its niche: rigorously decentralized, credibly neutral digital asset settlement ledger infrastructure._ It will establish itself as the world ledger, and then ethos/philosophy and economics will enable it to expand ""up the stack"" to become the world computer, as more apps get built and protocolized and tokenized._ Corpo-chains will be important infrastructure built on top of neutral permissionless chains, just as SQL, No SQL, graph and vector DBs and many other kinds of database connect commercial endeavors to the internet and web. Next generation databases will validate, be verifiable, will be tamper-proof, will maintain an inspectable log of their history and they will all speak token -- the language of the decentralized economy. When all of this matures, the world will finally have a secure global information infrastructure.

This is a ludicrous claim and is a consequence of believing your own BS.

Jeff argues that making every whale order fully transparent on-chain actually improves their execution quality because

(a) market-makers see the flow, step in, and tighten spreads, and
(b) the public liquidation/stop prices don_ really put whales at risk.

Both are objectively wrong.

(1) Pre-trade transparency increases adverse-selection costs for large traders

Execution cost is a zero-sum game because market-makers are utility maximizing entities. And information is a cost that is factored into this spread. Every extra dollar a market-maker extracts in spread is a dollar the transacting side pays. 

This is micro-structure 101. 

When a dealer/market maker knows the true size of an order, they widen spreads to offset inventory and information risk. If size revelation were free, TWAP/VWAP algos and hidden-size (_ceberg) orders wouldn_ exist.

By transmitting full-size, the whale ends up paying both the prevailing-spread and the follow-on impact as the book-reprices. 

Hyperliquid publishes size, margin, even liquidation prices in real time. That removes every information advantage the whale has and is offering this up for free to the market makers. So either you:

(a) keep that advantage and trade at the prevailing spread OR 
(b) you give it up and pay both the prevailing spread plus the follow-on price impact as the book re-prices. 

Perfect transparency doesn_ eliminate spread_t simply transfers the cost of execution entirely onto the party showing size.

In fact you also see this behavior on the HL orderbook. Every time there is a large order at the TOB, you notice the other-side immediately thin out. You can observe this even without an algo. Just stare at the orderbook long enough.

(2) Transparency feeds other  predatory and anticipatory traders further increasing the cost of transacting.

There is already a ton of empirical data and research on on _redatory trading, _rder-anticipation, and MEV all document that when large flow is observable, other fast agents front-run or back-run it, extracting rents from the order-placing originator.

See Flash Boys 2.0 or this paper  arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234

(3) Public liquidation bands create new attack surfaces and invite _unting

Liquidation _unts are not hypothetical. Same logic as broadcasting size: information is a cost. If the world knows your liquidation price, you WILL get hunted. Ask @JamesWynnReal.  Jeff knows this; spinning a known risk as a _eature is pure narrative gymnastics.

(4) Tradfi market structure tells the opposite story

50% of U.S. equity volume now trades off-exchange or in dark pools precisely so institutions don't advertise size.

Icebergs, conditional blocks, and RFQ platforms like @tradeparadigm and @Tradeweb exist simply because big size and fully lit books don_ mix. Paradigm alone is 35% of Deribit_ daily volume_roof that large clips avoid the CLOB. We wouldn_ have a business if everything went to the lit book. 

Retardio

Also note that in Tradfi regulators demand post-trade transparency for fairness, yet allow pre-trade opacity because it delivers better execution.

TLDR,
a) Transparent books are great for retail price discovery; they_e empirically worse for block execution. This is why @tradeparadex will have both a CLOB and RFQs for large-block execution away from the orderbook.

b) 50-years of market-structure evolution, real-world behavior of institutional desks (dark pools, algos, hidden size) and the academic record on predatory trading, front-running and MEV all contradict Jeff_ arguments.

The more troubling thing is that yet another crypto founder is more than happy to bend facts to fit a self serving narrative.

https://x.com/FigoETH/status/1988576679871078745,@FigoETH,https://x.com/RyanSAdams,"Closer look at entities running ETH & SOL validators / nodes.

tldr; entities running:

ETH validators: 12k+
ETH nodes: 10k+ 

SOL validators: 928
SOL nodes: 313 (running in 199 datacenters)

Wanted to have a more data based overview about the entities running the respective networks so I had a closer look and also asked @bw_solana if the data makes sense for SOL (thanks bro!).

I made this research to my best knowledge and with help of ChatGPT, if you have additional data it's very appreciated.

APPROACH FOR ETH
General problem is that the overall number of validators of ~1M doesn't say much about how decentralized the network is since one entitiy can run many validators.

So only valid approach to compare both networks is to have a look at the entities running those validators and nodes (checking validator output).

The numbers quoted above for ETH are the best (convervative) guess I can come up with and they're definitely only an educated (and I think reasonable) guess.

The only thing we know for certain is that there are around ~10,200 EL clients running and 8,700 CL clients (ethernodes.org/?synced=1; it shows less CL clients than EL due to technical reasons, eg. CL often sit behind NATs). 

What this data doesn't show is if these clients are validators or just nodes and if several validators / nodes are run by one entity.

So how did I come up with the 12k+ number for entities running validators?

We know by a study made by ETH Zurich in 2023 (tik-old.ee.ethz.ch/file//139) and by research of rated (github.com/ethstaker/solo-st) that in 2023 there have been around ~7,800 solo stakers and in 2024 ~5.4% of ETH staked can be attributed to solo stakers. There is also a survey from 2025 by ethstaker.org/ which analyzed the number of validators run by solo stakers (paragraph.com/%40ethstaker/s). By combining these data points it's reasonable to assume that we should have at least around 8,000 solo stakers (based on a slight increase from 7,800 (ETH Zurich) in 2023). Running the numbers with rated & ethstaker data leads to similar results.

The rest of entites running validators are more easy. We have around 4k Rocketpool operators (medium.com/rocket-pool/bi-we), around 300 Lido operators (blog.lido.fi/lido-validator-). We also have ~260 Lido DVT operators: blog.lido.fi/a-year-with-sim) and around 400 professional operators like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance etc. (ChatGPT assumption).

This leads us to ~12,960 validator entities which I rounded off to 12k to stay conservative.

The 10k+ number for nodes is honestly just an educated guess for me which makes sense but have to admit that ETH really lacks concrete numbers here. Why I think 10k+ is reasonable: part of ETH USP is that running nodes is trivil re: required hardware, so everybody with an consumer laptop and a standard internet connection can do this. Personally think the number is quite higher but can't prove that. And so it seemed taking the 10k confirmed number for synchned clients by ethernodes.org/?synced=1 seemed like a good approach.

APPROACH FOR SOL
This was much more easy since validators / nodes mostly only run in data centers. Official number for validators rn is 928 (firedancer.asymmetric.re/)

Re. nodes I identified the entities with help of a cluster-nodes.json and letting ChatGPT eliminate all IP duplicates which led to 313. The datacenter number was done by doing ASN deduplication and let to 199.

TAKEAWAY (for me)

- homestaking is incredibly important for decentralization of ETH, majority of validator entities are run by solo stakers
- @Rocket_Pool really doing gods work for ETH decentralization
- Lido really improved decentralization efforts, kudos
- it's not that good that we rely on educated guesses / slightly outdated data for something like entities running validators / nodes for ETH network. I know it's due to privacy / having homestaking / running nodes in the first place but perhaps some smart people can up with a privacy preserving opt-in way for people running validators / nodes to signal the entities? Could still be gamed but would be better than the situation we have now.",2025-11-12T11:56:00.000Z,31,37,174,1,ETH,positive,1

https://x.com/firstadopter/status/1982155280423977243,@firstadopter,https://x.com/DavidSacks,"Why AI is Underhyped and Isn't a Bubble Yet

Here's why AI isn't a bubble today. I've distilled the data points and ideas from my previous columns and coverage. If you prefer facts and evidence-based reality over vibes and conflated narratives, enjoy!

-Big Tech valuations are reasonable and leverage is low. We're at the beginning of multiple AI super product cycles in the year ahead
-We are in the early innings of a technology computing shift to AI, the largest in decades. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-Every credible source reports overwhelming demand for AI computing capacity. Where is the overcapacity glut? Nowhere. 

Valuations
-During the dotcom bubble, top technology stocks like Microsoft and Cisco traded at 70 to 100 times forward P/E in December 1999 (remember these stocks went significantly higher in Q1 2000 too) versus today's top stocks (Nvidia etc.) trading at 30x with materially better underlying fundamental growth prospects.
-The positive cycle sentiment remains in early stages. The Netscape IPO occurred in 1995, five years before the cycle peak. Is there any doubt the eventual OpenAI IPO will be a Netscape-type success? AI is only two to three years in. Think 1994 versus 1999.
-The major buyers of AI infrastructure are the most profitable businesses in history, each generating roughly $100 billion in annual net profit. This is nothing like the debt-driven fiber optic network buildout of the dotcom era.

Generational Secular Computing Shift
-The global TAM for IT spending is $5-6 trillion annually. The entire technology stack needs restructuring and rearchitecting for AI because this new technology produces better results for corporations and consumers. You either use it or get disrupted by rivals who do.
-Think electrification. Think the advent of the microprocessor and personal computer in the early 1980s. It's that significant.
-The first growth wave was driven by natural language processing with LLMs and the application of parallel GPU computing. For the first time, computers could understand context from user language input. Previously, if you typed one character wrong in a query request, the computer would fail. GPUs allowed companies to apply incredible computing power to distill and compress knowledge from vast pools of unstructured data.
-The current second wave of growth is driven by reasoning models that are significantly more accurate and useful by spending more time working on requests and searching dozens of websites. Reasoning models use 100 to 1,000 times more compute resources than prior models. The next wave will feature increased use of multi-modal models (audio/video) and agents (workflow automation, multi-step tasks). The following wave will be driven by physical AI, drug discovery, factory simulation, and robotics.

AI Bubble Skeptic Arguments
-Skeptics focus on simplistic narratives without nuance. It's up a lot, so it must be a bubble. OpenAI is losing a lot money!
-This mirrors narratives from earlier this year when skeptics claimed the DeepSeek moment meant expensive training runs were no longer needed because DeepSeek was trained with only $6 million in spending (a false statement especially as literally in the same week China announced $140 billion in new AI investment). They also claimed DeepSeek's efficiency meant a computing glut was ahead. Both views proved categorically false and misleading as reasoning models (including DeepSeek!) and better AI models sparked an exponential wave of AI computing demand over the last nine months.
-OpenAI's business model divides into two parts. Training new models requires enormous fixed investment, with each model driving roughly 10x more spending. Inference, serving already developed and built models, is extremely profitable.
-Do you believe leading AI edge models will be a foundational technology transforming every business worldwide? The answer is yes. Companies view the risk as existential.
-100% of Nvidia's engineers use AI coding assistants like Cursor. These AI assistants make engineers more productive by autocompleting code and automatically fixing bugs. All developers will use AI assistants in the future. Customer service? Same. AI will improve chatbots for customer service while giving live agents all the information they need from prior conversations and the latest product updates to improve service quality. Sales agents? Same. Product research and development? Same. AI will test product ideas and iterations while simulating every permutation.
-This is happening and will continue happening. It_ inevitable. Every company will use AI in every part of their business. I spoke with executives from Nvidia, Dell, and Microsoft this month. It's occurring everywhere and accelerating.

Circularity
-Thus far, the vast majority of spending has come from profitable large technology companies. Now concerns about circular vendor spend is rising.
-Despite what you hear, much of this hasn't occurred yet, and each gigawatt of spending depends on specific performance technical milestones on both sides (AMD-OpenAI deal).
-Yes, the Oracle-OpenAI deal is real with hundreds of billions in RPO. Let's assume it's $300 billion over five years, requiring roughly $60 billion annually.
-Alphabet/Google generates about $400 billion in sales with $120 billion profit. Meta generates $200 billion in sales with $73 billion profit. 
-Markets and investors look at the potential future not the present or past. The question becomes can OpenAI eventually become a technology giant using their AI model advantage and product execution abilities? ChatGPT's user base has grown from 0 to 800 million in three years. Can it reach 2 or 3 billion in another three years? It seems achievable. Like Google in its early years, ChatGPT currently has a scale advantage where the large user base has started a flywheel, enabling ChatGPT to iterate, improve, get more data, and A/B test better answers for users.

Nvidia NVL72 Super Cycle  Pre-iPhone Moment
-Dan Benton noted that technology investing revolves around product cycles. In just over two years, Nvidia has increased its quarterly data center revenue tenfold. As impressive as this is, the company will likely experience its best product cycle ever over the next few quarters, comparable to the iPhone launch.
-Nvidia has recently begun shipping GB200/GB300 NVL72 servers in volume for the first time. Foxconn, a major AI server manufacturer for Nvidia, reports that current quarter AI server revenue will increase 170% year-over-year.
-What is the NVL72? The first AI server with 72 GPUs in one server rack versus 8 GPUs in prior models. It offers 25 to 30 times better performance than the previous model and will enable more AI capabilities and use cases. Each server weighs 1.5 tons, contains 5,000 copper cables (2 miles), and offers unprecedented computing density.

AI Demand Signs
-EVERY credible industry source reports off-the-charts demand and overwhelming compute shortages everywhere. EVERY SINGLE ONE.
-Microsoft's Scott Guthrie, head of the Cloud + AI group at Microsoft and member of the senior executive team, told me this month he sees an ""explosion"" of AI infrastructure usage ahead, driven by reasoning/agents and workflow automation.
-TD Cowen: ""Based on our checks, 3Q25 would represent the largest inflection in demand we have seen since the inception of the data center industry... a staggering ~7.4GW of U.S. data center capacity was leased by hyperscalers in 3Q25, which would exceed all capacity leased in 2024."" Largest inflection in demand in history. Right now. More capacity in one quarter than all of last year.
-TSMC's CEO says AI demand is ""stronger than"" they thought three months ago. Given the strength three months ago, that's remarkable. He then literally describes today's growth as ""insane,"" strongly hinting at guidance and capex raises in January.
-Four-year-old A100 GPUs remain profitable today on inference tasks.
-Microsoft AI startup employee states: ""Many days it feels my whole job is begging for GPUs. It's been that way since 2020 and hasn't become easier.""
-Anthropic's ARR grew from $1 billion to $7 billion in 10 months.
-Crusoe CEO: ""Every single customer we talk to is compute-constrained right now.""
-AI token consumption data points from Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google show exponential growth YTD.

Conclusion 
-Hold on to your hats. We're just getting started. The next several quarters are going to be off the charts.",2025-10-25T18:40:00.000Z,62,156,882,0,,positive,1

@ETHZilla_ATNF is launching a community-oriented $ETH treasury vehicle, aiming to optimize yield generation and serve as a gateway to TradFi and the bonds market.

Worth noting: Its chairman has opted not to use leverage due to potential drawdowns in #Ethereum price, which could trigger a nasty forced liquidation spiral in a bear market. However, the recent issuance of convertible notes raises questions about whether this intention will be fully respected.

Let_ take a closer look _

PRESS RELEASE: Electric Capital will serve as the external asset manager for the Company, and plans to implement a differentiated, on-chain yield generation program. This program will be designed with the goal of outperforming traditional ETH staking, while maintaining robust risk management, seeking to leverage a combination of staking, lending, liquidity provisioning and bespoke private agreements.

@Etherealize_io, together with a consortium of leading DeFi builders and pioneers, will advise ETHZilla on using its treasury to optimize yields. 

_ur strategy aims to give investors exposure to a high-yield ecosystem in the stablecoin and tokenized asset markets, McAndrew Rudisill said, estimating returns of high single to low double digits on the company_ $ETH.

As mentioned, the company also intends to avoid relying on debt financing for its $ETH acquisition. @avichal from EC has also expressed concerns about this risk in recent interviews.

Rudisill stated that: ""There will be a point in the cycle where maybe Ether runs to $15,000 and pulls back to $10,000. That_ still a 33% drawdown. We don_ want to be levered for that.""

I_e reviewed recent filings and here_ what I found �__

- Formerly 180 Life Sciences, now fully rebranding into an ETHZilla. Announced major shift in business model but plan to continue its legacy core business operations, including in biotech and iGaming

- McAndrew Rudisill, appointed Chairman before August 4 2025, is Founder & Managing Partner of Harbor Island Equity Partners, LLC and former CIO & Director of Bridger Aerospace.

- Rudisill holds 563,035 shares and 4,807,873 warrants at $2.775.

- Jordan Blair is the CEO & director, and 10% owner of ETHZilla. He owns 1,888,742 shares and 3,908,986 options at $2.92 (granted on July 29, 2025).

- Ryan Lewis Smith is the Lead Independent Director, holding 167,181 shares and 3,908,986 options at $2.92 (granted on July 29, 2025).

- Appointment of Andrew Suckling and Crystal Heter as directors on August 4, 2025, with annual compensation of $350'000 each. No shares. Both are independent directors with capital markets and crypto expertise.

- Grant of 919,761 options to Stephen H. Shoemaker (board member), exercise price $2.92.

- 154,032,084 $ATNF shares post-PIPE.

- PIPE shares (142,882,173 shares) are not unlocked yet. They require an effective Initial Registration Statement, expected as early as August 15, 2025 (if no review) or as late as October 3, 2025 (if reviewed)

- The 17,495,849 pre-funded warrants can be exercised immediately but the resulting shares require registration before they can be resold.

- Buyback of 1,318,000 shares from Elray Resources for $650,000, under a Settlement and Release Agreement dated April 23, 2024. At $0.493 per share.

��_ Given:

- Implied mNAV of 1.06 at $3;
- Limited downside risk after PIPE shares reg;
- Very low float;
- Insiders holdings and strong incentive for success;
- Intention to avoid debt financing;
- Partnering with yield generation experts;
- Possible issuance of instruments suited for MM;
- Clean balance sheet;
- $BMNR ran $3 to $161 on $250M news;
- The cool rebrand

I believe $ATNF is under the radar right now and I've started building a position at today's price level.

Things I will keep an eye on __

- Weapon of choice to raise capital. Limited trading volumes make ATM dilution unlikly and push management toward direct offerings and possibly IPOs - similar to what @Strategy did with $STRC. This needs to happen really quick. The recent issuance of $165M in convertible notes contradicts Rudisill_ statement about not using debt.

- Added risk associated with DeFi strategies, if disclosed.

- Target in terms of $ETH acquisition.

Following direct discussions with individuals in the community and validators we have taken onboard some of the concerns, namely:

-Ethena is not a Hyperliquid native team
-We have other product lines outside of USDH
-Our ambitions extend beyond working with just one partner exchange

These are valid and we accept the pushback.

It appears the decision is a near certainty now and we will respectfully be withdrawing our proposal to allow validators to signal their support elsewhere if they want to.

Congratulations to the Native Markets team. You deserve this.

While some are complaining about their lack of credibility I think their success here perfectly embodies everything which is so special about Hyperliquid and their community.

No one gives a fuck how big you are, your background, pedigree or financial resources. It is a level playing field where emergent players can win the hearts of the community and are given a fair shot at succeeding.

To everyone within and outside the community who supported our proposal: thank you. It's a privilege and honour to build alongside you.

Also worth calling out the other proposals which were a testament to the quality of teams now in this space and it is great to see us all elevate each other to a higher level.

So what happens with Ethena on Hyperliquid going forward?

Well we are simply going to do everything we said we would.

If it wasn't obvious from our post, clipping 5% on tbill yields into a declining interest rate environment isn't exciting to us at all. In fact it was the least interesting part of our plans.

Developing new products with native teams including:
-hUSDe native synthetic dollars,
-USDe enabled savings and card spending products,
-enabling hedging flows on Hyperliquid,
-and the wide design space of HIP-3 markets uniquely enabled by Ethena: a) reward-bearing trading collateral,
b) modular prime broking,
c) perpetual swaps on equities

...is what actually excited us.

And we will be putting our full force behind making that a success despite the outcome here.

In short, we will do what we have always done since day one: outcompete everyone else on product regardless.",2025-09-11T13:52:00.000Z,424,264,2387,0,,neutral,1

https://x.com/goodalexander/status/1987571863136981459,@goodalexander,https://x.com/TheCryptoDog,"I_ pretty bullish. 

Why. Rare earth metals kicked off the liquidation cascade. Bc War with China (rare earths used for missiles) would be insanely bad. Rare earths have fully retraced move. Trump / Xi had an _kay meeting. If we were going to have imminent geopolitical escalation - it_ be non stop hacking. Maybe good for North Koreans (?) but bad for crypto vs gold 

Biggest concern was consumer bc Chipotle / Draftkings Las Vegas and consumer sentiment indicate it is extremely over. With $2k stimulus checks it is not, in fact, over. More speculative money goes straight into the casino - means alt demand 

Balance sheet expansion starts soon. This makes it easier to take overnight risk and leverage funds up. Funds can now access crypto instruments and stocks 

Fink is saying to tokenize everything. I don_ think he_ be focused on this nor would Jamie Dimon if the Clarity Act weren_ unlikely to pass. The government is deliberately turning the economy into a casino with stablecoin collateral to fund the deficit. 

This is hard to unplug once you do it. So even though Republican congress odds are off a cliff it probably doesn_ matter pragmatically. We will get the legislation we need and won_ go to jail before 2028 

Everyone is max bearish. And increasingly people realize the OpenAi IpO might just be an exit scam. Or that_ in the Overton window now that people realize the ROI on ai spend isn_ there but it doesn_ matter bc Nvidia can probably manufacture another $1T of revenue 

So stocks have outperformed crypto sustainably bc the narrative that equities are real and crypto is a scam. But if equities are a scam (highly likely) - and crypto now has privacy enabled in a liquid fashion (see Z cash and surging XMR liquidity, railgun on eth). Crypto becomes anti fragile way to play equity upside and keep your money out of the system after the crash 

Plus the part of AI that_ not a scam (dev work) - probably accelerates crypto roadmaps and cuts the cash burn for bloated teams 

I think ppl are waiting for a Luna esque shoe to drop but it would have dropped by now. Ethena has the money. The depeg wick was probably user error on binance. Things like aster and the hyperliquidation of everything turn every wallet interface into a casino (bullish fees)

Korean stock market 80%+ ytd run means there_ a vast amount of wealth in AI exposed stocks in Korea - that will be primed to rotate back into coins once the winds shift 

And you have massive checks going into and focused stablecoin teams to ensure users have money a couple clicks from stables, wallets or perp dex enabled wallets 

Trump administration probably pressures the s&p steering committee to get MSTR in Dec 19 which could inflect the narrative on DATs. The biggest risk for alts is that DATs become activist targets and alts get sold back onto the market while there_ no liquidity  

Going into Spring of next year you_l have both ECB and BOE headlines on CBDCs and I think by this point ppl realize these are Orwellian Nightmare organizations - and with liquid privacy coins - can see a lot of money getting swept into crypto. 

A lot of the concerns are trailing and a lot of the benefits (like on chain accretion due to institutional tokenization) are forward looking. People are depressed and rekt. So this is probably the part of the cycle where the institutions buy your coins. Thanks for playing",2025-11-09T17:23:00.000Z,110,145,1440,1,ETH,neutral,-0.6

The problem is, that tiny fee doesn't pay for transaction finality of the transfer. Neither does that entire block, which only had ~$3k in fees. Even the last hour of blocks total just ~$15k in fees.

Why does this matter? Finality comes from the economic cost to reverse mined blocks. Right now, 99%+ of Bitcoin_ economic security comes from new issuance, not fees. But issuance trends toward zero over time.

Without subsidies, you'd need around 600 blocks (~4 days) for today's finality. 

Caveats:
- Maybe we currently ""overpay"" for security, leaving some room as issuance decreases.
- Finality isn't purely economic_ocial consensus helps too. But relying too much on social consensus leads back toward tradfi-like trust.
- For a $1B transaction, waiting days is manageable. For smaller transactions, it's not practical.
- Longer finality times can decrease demand, further extending finality times_ dangerous spiral.

Bitcoin's economic problem isn't getting much attention right now, and with Bitcoin L2s we are arguably in a better position than ever to solve it. 

But it's still looming, and the Bitcoin community's inability to ship even simple updates like op_cat or op_ctv don't bode well for solving this 1000x bigger issue.

We stand here almost exactly 7 years later now. Bitcoin is over $100K and ETH is $3500. Objectively, we won and the government trying to shut all this down, ban it, cast stigma, etc lost.

In that time we_e seen the block wars fights, the rise of defi, infamous collapses, and the creation of some of the most important culture of our age. 

On every metric, we are better now than we were before. More friends, more institutions, more opportunities to get others interested.

I_e seen a lot of chatter about the Ethena depeg during the market mayhem this weekend. The story is that USDe briefly depegged to ~68c before recovering. Here_ the Binance chart everyone is quoting:

But digging into the data and talking to a bunch of folks over last couple days, it's now clear this story is not correct. USDe did *not* depeg.

First thing to understand about USDe: its most liquid venue is actually not on exchanges, it_ on Curve. There_ hundreds of millions of dollars of standing liquidity on Curve, while only tens of millions on any given exchange, including Binance.

So if you just look at that chart of USDe on Binance, it looks like USDe depegged. But if you superimpose the other liquid venues for USDe, you get a different picture:

We see here that while USDe wicked down on every CEX, it did not do so uniformly. Bybit briefly hit $0.95 then quickly recovered, yet Binance depegged a crazy amount and took forever to regain the peg. Curve meanwhile dipped a mere 0.3%. What explains this difference?

Remember, every single exchange was under immense load on that day_t was the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. Binance was extremely unstable during this period, causing MMs to be unable to shift inventory because APIs were failing and withdrawals and deposits were bricked. Nobody was able to step in and arb.

It_ like a fire broke out on Binance, but all of the roads were blocked and firefighters couldn_ make their way in. This caused a wildfire to break out on Binance, but pretty much everywhere else, that fire was immediately put out by bridging liquidity. (As Guy shows in his post, USDC also depegged a few cents temporarily on Binance due to the same general instability issues_iquidity just couldn_ get ferried in, but this wasn_ a depeg event for USDC either.)

So OK. Unsurprising that while there_ API instability, prices on exchanges are wildly different because nobody can get inventory in. But why did it decline so much deeper on Binance than on Bybit?

The answer is twofold_irst, Binance did not have any primary dealer relationship with Ethena to be able to directly mint and redeem on-platform (Bybit and other exchanges have this integrated) which allows MMs to stay on-platform and still perform peg arbitrage. This is huge, as otherwise an MM has to take their money *out* of Binance, go do the Ethena peg arb, and then bring back their inventory. Nobody was doing that in a moment of crisis when APIs were failing (plus so many other coins were cratering).

Second, Binance had their oracle poorly implemented and started liquidating positions they shouldn_ have_ood liquidation mechanisms don_ trigger on flash crashes. If you are not the primary venue for an asset (which Binance is not for USDe) then you should look at the price on the primary venue. If you are only looking at your own order book, you will liquidate too aggressively. This caused Binance to start liquidating USDe as though it was worth $0.80 or whatever, which caused a cascade. This is a big part of the reason why Binance is refunding people who were liquidated on USDe (other exchanges AFAIK are not doing so)_hey messed up by only looking at their own price instead of the true external price.

So this was a Binance-specific flash crash, which better market structure could_e prevented. USDe on its primary venue, Curve, was actually trading at a tight peg the entire day. This is really different from what you_ describe as a depeg.

If you remember USDC in 2023 during the banking crisis, this is what an actual depeg looks like:

During the banking crisis, USDC traded down on every single venue. There was *no* place where you could buy USDC for $1. Redemptions were literally halted, so $0.87 was the *true* price. That_ what a depeg means.

https://x.com/hosseeb/status/1977370087800889469,@hosseeb,https://x.com/Arthur_0x,"Did Ethena Really Depeg?

I_e seen a lot of chatter about the Ethena depeg during the market mayhem this weekend. The story is that USDe briefly depegged to ~68c before recovering. Here_ the Binance chart everyone is quoting:

But digging into the data and talking to a bunch of folks over last couple days, it's now clear this story is not correct. USDe did *not* depeg.

First thing to understand about USDe: its most liquid venue is actually not on exchanges, it_ on Curve. There_ hundreds of millions of dollars of standing liquidity on Curve, while only tens of millions on any given exchange, including Binance.

So if you just look at that chart of USDe on Binance, it looks like USDe depegged. But if you superimpose the other liquid venues for USDe, you get a different picture:

We see here that while USDe wicked down on every CEX, it did not do so uniformly. Bybit briefly hit $0.95 then quickly recovered, yet Binance depegged a crazy amount and took forever to regain the peg. Curve meanwhile dipped a mere 0.3%. What explains this difference?

Remember, every single exchange was under immense load on that day_t was the single largest liquidation event in crypto history. Binance was extremely unstable during this period, causing MMs to be unable to shift inventory because APIs were failing and withdrawals and deposits were bricked. Nobody was able to step in and arb.

It_ like a fire broke out on Binance, but all of the roads were blocked and firefighters couldn_ make their way in. This caused a wildfire to break out on Binance, but pretty much everywhere else, that fire was immediately put out by bridging liquidity. (As Guy shows in his post, USDC also depegged a few cents temporarily on Binance due to the same general instability issues_iquidity just couldn_ get ferried in, but this wasn_ a depeg event for USDC either.)

So OK. Unsurprising that while there_ API instability, prices on exchanges are wildly different because nobody can get inventory in. But why did it decline so much deeper on Binance than on Bybit?

The answer is twofold_irst, Binance did not have any primary dealer relationship with Ethena to be able to directly mint and redeem on-platform (Bybit and other exchanges have this integrated) which allows MMs to stay on-platform and still perform peg arbitrage. This is huge, as otherwise an MM has to take their money *out* of Binance, go do the Ethena peg arb, and then bring back their inventory. Nobody was doing that in a moment of crisis when APIs were failing (plus so many other coins were cratering).

Second, Binance had their oracle poorly implemented and started liquidating positions they shouldn_ have_ood liquidation mechanisms don_ trigger on flash crashes. If you are not the primary venue for an asset (which Binance is not for USDe) then you should look at the price on the primary venue. If you are only looking at your own order book, you will liquidate too aggressively. This caused Binance to start liquidating USDe as though it was worth $0.80 or whatever, which caused a cascade. This is a big part of the reason why Binance is refunding people who were liquidated on USDe (other exchanges AFAIK are not doing so)_hey messed up by only looking at their own price instead of the true external price.

So this was a Binance-specific flash crash, which better market structure could_e prevented. USDe on its primary venue, Curve, was actually trading at a tight peg the entire day. This is really different from what you_ describe as a depeg.

If you remember USDC in 2023 during the banking crisis, this is what an actual depeg looks like:

During the banking crisis, USDC traded down on every single venue. There was *no* place where you could buy USDC for $1. Redemptions were literally halted, so $0.87 was the *true* price. That_ what a depeg means.

This instead was a Binance-specific dislocation. It_ a big lesson for market infra, but critical to understand the nuance here if you are trying to draw inferences about USDe_ mechanism from this weekend.

USDe was fully collateralized and worth $1 on its primary venue through the entire episode and actually increased its backing collateral over the weekend due to the price action.

Blockchains are not done. 

If you believe we kept improving the tech on blockchains until 2023 and then stopped, and from that day forward, all the existing blockchains were complete and we would not need to scale any further, I fundamentally disagree with you. And it maps onto no other technology ever.

GPUs keep shipping new generations. Operating systems keep shipping new generations. Internet bandwidth (dialup, cable, DSL, fiber) keeps shipping new generations. But blockchains, they just stopped in 2023 because we got Aptos and Sui and Base and that was it, done?

Monad IMO is the most ambitious attempt to try to get the parallelism and performance in super high-throughput decentralized blockchains (like Solana, Aptos, and Sui) into the form factor of the blockchain dominant programming paradigm, the EVM.

Doing all of that in a decentralized way is a really hard problem. You have to rewrite all of this shit from the ground up and solve some really dificult system-level problems. And I believe if you solve that, and can foster a developer community, the prize is big.

Yes, people will use stablecoins on stablecoin chains. But do you think the next big application in crypto will be built on Arc? On Tempo? Or do you think there are no new ideas left? If you thought that two years ago, you'd be sorely mistaken. If you thought that four years ago, you'd also be mistaken.

Disruptive technologies *disrupt*. World-scale technologies need to *scale to the world*.

Is there an application that needs Monad and cannot exist anywhere else today? Of course not. All smart contract chains are Turing-complete. By definition, any  application can be written anywhere.

But what Monad is trying to deliver is getting Ethereum-level decentralization and trust, at Solana-level throughput and latency. Scaling blockchains is one of the most fundamental problems in crypto, period. It's why Solana went from 2 years ago being a ghost chain to now being one of the most dominant chains in existence, because it scaled when other chains couldn't.

If you think that doesn't matter and no one cares about a team building that, then we just disagree about our views of the big problems in crypto.",2025-11-06T03:37:00.000Z,22,16,167,0,,positive,1

Re: should retail buy $MON, I have no idea. Depends on the price and depends on how well Monad does. Monad doesn't get to set the price that retail can buy at, the market does that (or people trading on Hyperliquid or whatever). 

I have no idea what Monad will come out at--premarket trading has been super volatile--and I'm not advocating anyone buy the token. Not here to debate that either.

I'm arguing that what Monad is trying to build is ambitious and important--to build a decentralized EVM blockchain with Solana-level throughput. 

Teams like Monad who are trying to build better technology--the whole thing this industry is *founded* upon--is good. Yes, and should be encouraged. Making blockchains scale to a billion people is *actually* one of the most important problems in the industry. If you zoom out from the ""trenches"" and the PvP short-term perspective, and you think about what we are doing over the span of the next decade, we need to scale this technology so that hundreds of millions of people can use it.

That's what they are trying to do. It might not work--most startups don't work, and that's true in normal tech just as it is in crypto. But I am absolutely proud to have bet on them and would do it again, regardless of whether it makes us money.

""come on, we need use cases.""

To which I respond:

Yes, we also invest in applications! We've invested into Polymarket, Lighter, Agora, Rain, all sorts of use cases! 

But these guys are building a chain, they've been building this chain since 2022 (before Solana re-emerged from the ashes) and have been trying to solve this problem_ebuilding the EVM for super high performance_or years. And it's a very hard problem. They are finally at the finish line.

Every vintage we invest in fewer and fewer chains. In the 2018 vintage we invested in a bunch of them. In 2020 vintage we did a few. In the vintage with Monad, we only invested into two L1s. Possible in this vintage we invest in one or zero.

But very good chance chains are not done. Imagine yourself saying the same thing before Solana took off. Solana just took off two years ago! That's nothing. So much can change in crypto so quickly, why would you have this level of confidence that ""obviously we don't need better infrastructure""?

Write.

Short writeups, on Twitter. Not generic market philosophical thinkpieces, because those will be assumed to be AI slop or regurgitated research. No one will read it unless you're brilliant, which you're probably not.

Original research, on a specific company or sub-sector. If you want to write about robotics, even that is too broad. Narrow it down. Humanoid robotics, or healthcare robotics, military robotics, etc. Get really granular. So granular most people won't care. If it's something you could get by Googling, it's not narrow enough. 

You will not be able to find to do ""original research"" easily. This is not something you can do from a university library. You will have to go talk to people who work at these companies. Journalists who cover these companies. Pay for private industry-specific research / newsletters. Follow all of the employees/anons who are tweeting gossip. Integrate a picture that someone reading TechCrunch doesn't see.

Then write about this sector and leading + new startups and tag / DM every investor at every major firm who covers your space (you can find them because they've invested in one of the companies in the sector). If they express interest, offer coffee meetings with everyone you can. Some will take you up on it. 

Do this enough times, you'll develop a reputation and get offered a job in venture. Don't need to go to business school, don't need to have a great angel portfolio or any of the above. 

""Get good deal flow"" is wonderful if you have access to it, but most people just can't do this. If you're already surrounded by Stanford undergrads, you probably don't need advice to break into VC. But the above strategy--in principle anyone can do. Just need to have abnormal levels of agency and a willingness to basically do the job of a junior VC without anyone telling you to.

(While you're doing this, best thing to do in the meantime is to also work at a company in the sector you're chasing after. But not always possible depending on your background. Thankfully, VC does not require any particular background. Lots of weirdos in VC, myself included.)

I guarantee you, everyone wants to hire someone who can do the above. But very few candidates have this degree of agency. 

VC is not a ""tracked"" career. Hiring is arbitrary, firms are generally small and do not scale, and there is no standard path. This is good for you if you're willing to be weird. The thing that VCs have in common is that they are passionate about startups and understanding new industries.

1. Get better at speaking. Do embarrassing stuff like record yourself, Toastmasters, study good speakers and try to emulate them to try out their verbal techniques and see how they fit you. Charisma is the omni-skill.

2. Drink less, or not at all. It will force you to become a better conversationalist.

3. Buy art that your friends make and hang it on your walls.

4. Never lend money to family or close friends. Instead gift it to them, and if they pay you back, consider it a pleasant surprise.

5. Spend most of your money on experiences, not things.

6. Make sure your spending scales sublinearly compared to your income, and you will always feel rich.

7. Take a lot of risks. More risks that you think you should. When you're young, the downsides are never as big as you think, and other people's memories are short.

8. Every man is cobbled together from people they surround themselves with, both physically and mentally. Surround yourself with people you respect. If you never lose friends or never try to acquire better ones, you're doing it wrong.

9. Whenever you feel comfortable that you've made something of yourself, it's time to move on. Move to a bigger city. Try for a more prestigious company. Find the biggest games, and try your hand at them.

https://x.com/hosseeb/status/1988383380963291519,@hosseeb,https://x.com/hosseeb,"Late to this, but as a VC, here_ my perspective on airdrop farming:

Farmers are obviously not useful to projects.

@Cobie is right that as a VC, I ignore farming activity. I_ extremely skeptical of easily farmed metrics, and we always dig into the data to try to identify farming. Wherever we see it, we heavily discount it.

Farming is, by definition, people who pretend to use a product and pretend they will be long-term users, in order to get paid via an airdrop.

Let that sink in for a second. Crypto has broken all of our brains on this. If a normal consumer startup paid people to pretend to use their product and pretend to retain, that_ be considered fraud. Airdrops started as an idealistic and egalitarian practice, but the rise of industrial farming has evolved it into something straightforwardly toxic. Farmers try to emulate real users and make it hard for teams (and investors) to identify the difference.

So, no. Farming is obviously bad for startups. If it weren_ bad, farmers wouldn_ try to hide that they're farmers.

But farmers will reply: the value of farming is that farmers pump up metrics of successful projects, and therefore, it_ good for the projects.

This is so wrong it_ hard to even know where to start.

First, if farmers are _umping up metrics, who are they pumping them up to? Who is being fooled here by inflated metrics? Is it the VCs? If so, farmers are claiming that founders are conspiring with farmers to dupe their VCs. (And on many heavily farmed projects, VCs are underwater.)

Note: this is incompatible with the theory that VCs are the primary culprit of bad token launches. Either the VCs are dastardly villains conspiring with founders to dump on retail, or they_e stupid fools being duped by founders with farmer-inflated metrics. But it can't be both at the same time.

The other option is that it_ not the VCs who are fooled--VCs see through it--it_ retail who_ being fooled. So maybe farmers are conspiring with founders to dump on retail, and that_ why it_ good for founders. The problem with this theory is that founders don_ get to dump day 1, only farmers do. So by the time the chickens come home to roost, the metrics have already plummeted, the farmers got out by selling their airdrops, and the founder is left holding the bag. Only the farmers profited from retail, not the founder.

But even if we rationally agree with this analysis, to most people, it doesn_ matter. Because we all know that despite this, all good projects get farmed. So if nobody shows up to farm your project, that must imply your project is not good, and therefore you_l do poorly in the market. Don_ you want to be like all the other good projects? So you need farmers to show up, whether you think they're parasitic or not.

This sounds convincing. But it_ totally wrong, for the age-old reason: correlation is not causation. Yes, good projects get farmed. But the project being good causes the farming, the farming doesn_ cause the project to be good. All big cities have crime, but that doesn_ mean crime is causes cities to get big. The causation is backward. You can have a good project that isn't farmed.

To tell you the truth, I think the actual dumb money here is the exchanges. Exchange listing teams reward farmed metrics more than VCs do. But the market is already correcting on this, and norms are changing. It_ just exchanges tend to be the last to notice, as they_e furthest back in the capital stack.

Now all that being said, there_ nothing morally wrong with airdrop farming. No more than there being anything wrong with running MEV bots or sniping token launches. The game is the game. As long as you_e following the rules, all is fair. So there's no reason to look down on airdrop farmers. They're strategically trying to make money with the resources they have.

But are farmers providing value to founders?

No, obviously not.

(Caveat: _inear farming is an exception--if you_e being paid to provide liquidity or an insurance backstop, or some other clear assumption of risk, I_ call that more classic liquidity mining, which is totally valuable. Or if you_e being paid to market make or provide tight spreads, that_ also valuable. This kind of farming is pay-for-performance that contributes to a product moat. But that_ not like the vibes based _retend to be a user and touch everything"" type farming I_ talking about above, which tends to be more common for L1/L2s or for consumer products.)",2025-11-11T23:08:00.000Z,461,103,1279,0,,neutral,1

men tend to choose based on fertility cues

women tend to choose based on signals which imply skills/status from a mate that could guarantee/enhance survival of them and their offspring

based on a partner who can navigate the current world and achieve success and sometimes status (i.e., support survival and obtain sufficient/excess resources)

as well as someone who can very likely adapt to potential future societal and environmental changes and still be successful, while showing they can minimize downside risk and maximize upside potential (i.e., provide stability)

the archetype this selects for has varied significantly over time, and in the future it will keep varying. in ancient environments, this likely implied selecting mostly based on size and strength as physical survival was paramount

in modern day, it implies many other factors as the world is significantly more dynamic today (raw knowledge of esoterica still not valuable unless accompanied by signals of more useful skills/adaptability)

wrong

and the main reason why this is wrong is because of economic network effects

if/when Ethereum starts securing and settling trillions in value, what's easier: moving that value elsewhere to the fastest new chain, or extending Ethereum and building flexible structures on top of it so it can settle even more?

Anyone can access INFINIT's AI Agents for agentic coordination in their financial apps.

This partnership marks the first step towards INFINIT becoming the universal infrastructure for agentic finance.

This is the foundation for agentic finance at scale.

Proven in DeFi, Built for Global Finance

INFINIT has proven sophisticated agent coordination in DeFi:
 559,000+ Wallets
 506,000+ DeFi Conversations
 633,000+ Agent Transactions

DeFi was the start. Next is scaling these capabilities to millions of developers building the future of agentic finance.

A2A Integration Unlocks Exponential Distribution

INFINIT integrates with Agent2Agent (A2A), Google's open standard for AI agent interoperability.

This transforms how developers access INFINIT's DeFi capabilities.

Every application adopting A2A automatically gains access to INFINIT's agent infrastructure, exponentially expanding reach from individual partnerships to ecosystem-wide distribution.

Any application can now integrate INFINIT's agentic coordination capabilities:
 Wallets requiring intelligent portfolio management
 Trading platforms executing cross-chain strategies
 Financial services building autonomous yield optimization
 Portfolio managers coordinating multi-protocol operations

Developers integrate sophisticated agentic coordination in a matter of hours, while users access advanced financial strategies with agentic coordination.

Google's AI Infrastructure That Enables Agentic Finance

Google Cloud's Vertex AI provides the foundation enabling INFINIT's agent coordination at scale with these capabilities:

1. Specialization: Vertex AI's Model Garden lets INFINIT's infrastructure to automatically select the optimal LLM for each natural language query.

2. Personalization: Vertex AI's RAG Engine processes massive on-chain and off-chain data, enabling agents to understand user history, market conditions, and protocol details providing complete context to AI agents.

3. Accuracy: Gemini's capability feeds complete instructions to all 30+ agents across multiple blockchains without compromises resulting in zero hallucination in financial execution._

The Vision: From DeFi to Payments to Complete Financial Coordination

This is only the beginning of INFINIT and Google's collaboration.

Google recently launched its Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) as an extension of A2A - enabling autonomous commerce across 60+ partners including American Express, Mastercard, PayPal, Coinbase, and Revolut.

Agents will be able to execute purchases, coordinate bookings, and manage delegated financial tasks autonomously, starting from payments.

The next stage entails sophisticated agentic coordination beyond simple transactions. INFINIT provides this through A2A-compatible DeFi infrastructure where agents orchestrate:

 Personalized yield optimization
 Cross-chain liquidity management
 Portfolio rebalancing across protocols
 Multi-step strategy execution

As the agentic payment ecosystem matures, INFINIT becomes the infrastructure enabling agents to not only spend capital, but strategically manage and grow it._

From standalone DeFi agents to the universal infrastructure for global agentic finance.

This partnership and integration with Google and Google Cloud positions INFINIT as a key building block for agentic finance, helping shape a more transparent, efficient, and accessible financial system.

It's incredibly fast, boasting the title of the fastest coding model, and features its own in-house AI model named Composer, which helps reduce reliance on external resources.

Managing multiple agents simultaneously is a big plus, allowing users to oversee various tasks at once. While the design has improved and certain functions, like real-time data pulling, work seamlessly, there are still some UI hiccups that need addressing.

Despite substantial progress, it_ not quite the top choice over Claude Code for everyone. The communication and explanations from Cursor_ model lag behind, but it_ definitely making strides. If you're interested in AI coding tools, giving Cursor 2.0 a test run is highly recommended; it might be your perfect fit!

Cursor 2.0 is INSANE, but is it better than Claude Code?

I was prepping for the coming epoch rebalance when I noticed the SOL balance inside INF dropped suddenly from ~80,000 to ~10,000.

It appears as if a JupSOL whale just swapped nearly 64,000 JupSOL ($14.1m USD) to USDC via Jupiter. 

All 3 of these transactions were routed through INF by swapping JupSOL -> SOL.

This is the important role INF plays for our partners and their users - providing a significant amount of LST->SOL Liquidity each epoch.

The fees this user paid for these swaps will go to boosting the INF APY this epoch. 
 
This epoch is due to end in around 2 hours. Once it does, we'll be topping up this SOL balance inside INF to ensure our partner's LSTs and their users will have plenty more SOL liquidity, just like this, should they need it ��__

We invest a minimum of $500,000 in each company accepted to CSX.

The CSX 04 program will start in April and end in June with a Demo Day event, where each company gets the opportunity to pitch their project to an audience of prominent investors, thought leaders, and executives from many of the top crypto companies.

Some highlights: 

1) Blew past even our most optimistic ARR goals

2) Advertising revenue hit ATH as we focused on longer, multi-quarter and (sometimes multi-year) campaigns

3) Average quarterly deal size more than 2x previous record as we focused more on enterprise customers

4) Churn on data/research platform was lowest ever as we shipped many of our most requested products

5) Shipped two very crucial data products (Chart Builder and API)

6) Podcasts ripping driven by livestreams + short clips

7) AI drastically improving speed of news content

8) Events team put together an incredible DAS London (two weeks out)

9) Now have 27 teams onboarded to the Token Transparency Framework

10) Team is stronger than ever, working their ass off, and I think having a lot of fun

Tough to compete with Blockworks right now.

TL/DR: Blockworks is becoming a software/data first org

When Mike and I started Blockworks in 2017, we wanted to solve ""the information problem."" Crypto was growing up fast and the new entrants deserved better information.

We've built everything from events to podcasts, research, data, and news. 

As we_e scaled, we_e experienced massive growth across all business units: we've had record revenues in 2025 and we'll have another record year in 2026. 

Over the past two years, we have seen particularly rapid growth in our data business. The market is telling us that our combo of data + distribution is extremely valuable. Every day, we hear from both investors and protocols that Blockworks data is critical to their daily workflow.

And so, we're going all in on what Mike and I believe is the greatest opportunity we_e seen since launching Blockworks in 2017. More on this soon :) 

Now, to talk about news... 

Mike and I launched news in 2021 as an extension of our events, podcasts, and newsletter businesses. 

At the time, crypto media couldn't speak fluently to tradfi, and trad media couldn't understand crypto. 

Since then, Blockworks has broken big stories, published thousands of stories, been cited by nearly every major publication, and helped shape the industry conversation every day. I am very proud of the work that the team has done.

But the landscape is changing and the same problems don_ exist today. 

There are many strong crypto media publications. Great journalists combined with new tools have raised the bar in reporting, and traditional outlets have also improved. Meanwhile, users are increasingly looking toward data as a primary information source.

So we_e decided to sharpen our focus on software and data and exit our news business.

To our incredible news team: a huge, heartfelt thank you. You built something that helped shape the industry and fueled the growth of Blockworks. I have a deep amount of respect for all that you do. To anyone hiring crypto journalists, please reach out  everyone is incredible.

To the broader Blockworks community: over the coming months, you_l see Blockworks evolve into a data-first intelligence platform. Our website will become a true data destination. Our main newsletters and podcasts will continue to set the pace for conversations that drive the industry. Our events will continue to grow (DAS is coming to Abu Dhabi next year). 

And we_e rolling out more category-defining software and data products soon.

Seems contrarian, I know. But 18 months ago all the AI experts were saying there is nothing to be done about the communication bandwidth bottleneck. That view has now been completely invalidated by Pluralis: we can train on commodity hardware, on consumer devices. GenSyn models, trained by a decentralized RL swarm, is top 3 on HuggingFace. Prime Intellect is heading for massive post-training runs.

It is well known that Big Tech_ proprietary approach slows down innovation. The beauty of web3 is we can move faster with open source research *and* monetize it effectively on decentralized networks.

Big Tech doesn_ completely compete on intelligent models. They are actually competing on dominating and locking in the customer. They do this through good UX and integrations. 

But when the deAI stack starts competing at the consumer level as well, customers will have an interesting choice: put my data into this exploitative corporation, or take the privacy preserving (or at least open source) alternative. 

If deAI stacks start siphoning off customers, I would be selling Big Tech stock. The big cos will eventually not be able to monetize the progress as fast as open networks.

We have seen web3 networks aggregate a lot of compute. We are going to see them train a large model on that compute soon. But there are also 11 other scaling dimensions on which deAI stacks will compete.

The idea, the sheer concept, of DeFi is mind-bending for policymakers. That you can have code operate without a centralized authority is something that is new in the world. 

What is needed therefore is not just paeans to DeFi but also discussions of how it is good for people. How it creates competition to established, rent-seeking incumbents. How it allows for ownership by everyone without nationalization, thereby reflecting the ancient notion of the Commons, something owned by all communally. And how it can reduce costs by cutting out unnecessary middlemen. 

If you_e been swimming in crypto_ seas for years, these facts are so obvious to you that they don_ require explication.

This is typical for legislation: Congress sets out a regulatory framework and then empowers the agencies to fill up the details.

Historically, that approach has been a non-starter for crypto. When Gensler's SEC was in ""kill the industry"" mode, our best defense was that the SEC lacked jurisdiction to regulate this novel market. Legislation clearly giving the SEC more authority was unthinkable in that environment, since it was obvious that the SEC would use any new power it received to destroy crypto.

As a result, past negotiations over market structure bills focused largely on cabining agency discretion. If there was a way that a hostile regulator could abuse a new grant of authority to destroy crypto, then the bill was unacceptable. This approach was well-justified, but it also made legislation practically impossible: there's just no way to hammer out every detail of a new regulatory framework this significant in Congress.

Now the environment has changed. We have regulators at the SEC and CFTC who deeply understand crypto and want to implement reasonable rules that work for the technology and the industry. But we only have them for sure until January 20, 2029  after that, we could be looking at four more years of Gensler or someone like him. Fear of that risk is a primary driver of the politics underlying the market structure bill today.

The industry has to decide between two options:

(1) demand a bill that gives agencies so little discretion that crypto could survive a second Gensler term, or

(2) accept agency authority with the hope that current leadership does a ton of great rulemaking and future leadership doesn't reverse course.

The risk of (1) is that we don't get a market structure bill done at all. Reasonable minds can differ on what that would mean for crypto. Some will say it's fine, that we built everything we have now under the status quo, that agency rulemaking will continue to unlock innovation, and that we shouldn't rush something as existentially important as market structure  we only get one shot at this. Others will say this is our best and maybe only chance, that the status quo was a path to ruin, that perfect can't be the enemy of good, and that acting now will legitimize and energize the industry in a way that makes future attacks politically unviable.

The risk of (2) is obvious: an anti-crypto president wins the next election and new anti-crypto agency leaders have all the firepower they need to kill us, because we stupidly handed it to them. The devil is in the details here  what authorities do they have, and how exactly can they abuse them  but it's hard to deny that this scenario is a plausible one.

The choice between these two options will determine DAMCA's future as much as any detail in the bill.

The bill's authors are collecting feedback now in advance of a hearing this week and a bill markup next week. Hopefully there will be changes to give the industry more comfort that crypto will be protected from future hostile regulators, along with other important fixes throughout the draft.

The early reaction to the bill has been positive, but don't take that to mean everyone is on board, and don't be surprised if the early applause turns to concern as the prospect of DAMCA actually becoming law sets in. Stay tuned  this is not a drill.",2025-06-02T13:23:00.000Z,27,16,92,0,,positive,1

The House is trying to pass three bills this week  GENIUS (stablecoins), CLARITY (market structure), and Anti-CBDC (self-explanatory). GENIUS already passed the Senate, so if it passes the House, it goes to the President and becomes law. CLARITY and Anti-CBDC are new in the House, so would move on to the Senate.

On Tuesday, the House Freedom Caucus and others blocked a procedural vote to advance the bills for a variety of reasons, but mainly over CBDCs, which they despise. The concern was that the Anti-CBDC bill wasn't prioritized enough and might fail even while GENIUS and CLARITY pass.

On Wednesday, a deal was struck to include the Anti-CBDC bill in a must-pass bill, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House then voted 217 - 212 in favor of moving forward on all three bills. That vote took 10 hours, the longest vote in modern House history.

Now this morning, the House is back to debate and vote on GENIUS and CLARITY. The President has a signing ceremony scheduled for tomorrow (Friday) and everyone expects GENIUS to be on his desk by then, so hopes are high for stablecoin legislation to be done today. CLARITY will likely slip to next week.

https://x.com/jchervinsky/status/1965909251198734845,@jchervinsky,https://x.com/jessewldn,"The $USDH debate is one of the more interesting events in recent crypto memory  a case where US policy (the GENIUS Act) is crucial to a major design decision.

I have no vote, but I do see some misunderstanding about GENIUS worth clarifying. A few points to consider for those evaluating the proposals:

1) There is no such thing as a ""GENIUS-compliant"" stablecoin today.

A lot of the debate has focused on whether the stablecoin proposals comply with GENIUS. But the bill itself doesn't actually provide the rules for how issuers can comply  it sets forth a general framework and leaves the details for regulators to fill in through rulemaking. A whole lot of rulemaking! And until that rulemaking is done, there is no way to evaluate if a stablecoin is compliant.

Rulemaking isn't a minor detail or mere delay  GENIUS literally doesn't become effective law until 120 days after the rules are finalized, which is supposed to happen by July 18, 2026. That set the expected effective date of GENIUS at November 15, 2026. Until then, stablecoins will continue to be regulated exactly as they were one, five, ten years ago.

Given this, what matters most is that $USDH complies with current law as it stands today. Sure, it's possible to get a jump start on GENIUS by obtaining licenses or charters sooner than later. But it's equally possible to waste time and resources on the wrong approach before rulemaking is done.

Stablecoin issuers should have plenty of time to get into compliance with GENIUS as the rules come together. Supporting or opposing $USDH proposals based on GENIUS compliance today  before we even know what GENIUS compliance means  seems like putting the cart before the horse.

2) State regulation offers little or no benefit for stablecoins with over $10b in total supply.

Some of the debate has focused on state charters and licensing as an advantage for GENIUS compliance. I don't see it.

One thing we know about GENIUS is that it will offer two pathways for stablecoin issuance  state and federal. The state pathway will work for smaller stablecoins that keep their total supply under $10b. The federal pathway will be mandatory for all stablecoins that get bigger than $10b.

If you're bullish on the Hyperliquid ecosystem, then you probably want to plan for $USDH to exceed $10b in total supply. This means the issuer will need to follow federal, not state, compliance requirements. To do so, issuers will have to be regulated as banks or obtain a federal charter from the OCC.

It's hard to see how state charters or licensing could help with the federal pathway. In fact, obtaining state charters or licenses may be a waste of time and resources, except to the extent necessary to comply with current law before GENIUS becomes effective. So the focus on state regulation seems misplaced.

3) Evaluating GENIUS compliance is a ""founder bet"" as much as a legal analysis.

As I've said a couple times, it is definitely important that $USDH comply with current law as it stands.

But since GENIUS isn't effective yet  and since we don't even know what the rules will be  the key question for evaluating $USDH proposals isn't ""is this team GENIUS-compliant right now?"" but rather ""is this team sophisticated and skilled enough to become GENIUS-compliant when the time comes?""

As @CampbellJAustin said today, ""Fun to see this @HyperliquidX thing waking everyone up to the fact that distribution is the key economic factor for stablecoins...."" In my humble opinion, what you want is a killer team that can follow the law today, prepare for the law tomorrow, and meanwhile crush the $USDH go-to-market with world-class execution.

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We_l cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. 

There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader_ doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job. 

I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America_ success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical  it minimizes coercion  and practical  it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.

After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won_ be easy, and it will require 100% commitment   I respect his decision.

Imagine waking up in a decade to find your Bitcoin wallet drained. Not because of a hack, but because the math that once protected it has silently broken down. No alerts. No patch. Just physics, catching up.

The financial world  both traditional and decentralized  runs on cryptography. But that foundation is under threat from quantum computing.

In 2024, Google_ Willow chip solved in minutes a problem that would take the best classical supercomputer longer than the age of the universe to crack. Experts estimate that quantum computers will reach the threshold to break today_ cryptographic systems sometime between 2035 and 2050. Close enough to matter now.

The U.S. government is pushing federal agencies and the banks they work with to migrate to post-quantum standards by 2030. But for decentralized financial systems, coordination is much harder. There_ no single vendor or update cycle. The upgrade path is messy.

Most of crypto is sleepwalking toward this risk, even though the stakes are existential. But one team is sounding the alarm and building the safety net.

That_ why we led an investment in Project Eleven @qdayclock.

Project Eleven is building the infrastructure crypto needs to survive and thrive in a post-quantum world.

Their first product, yellowpages, is like a fire escape for your Bitcoin. It lets holders generate quantum-resistant keys, prove ownership of their existing addresses, and publicly register those proofs, without moving funds or waiting for a protocol upgrade. It_ simple, free, and available today. It_ a way to secure what you already own against a threat that hasn_ arrived, yet.

Project Eleven is led by @apruden08, someone I_e known and respected for years. We first met at Andreessen Horowitz, where we were both investment partners on the crypto team. Even then, it was clear that, as a former Special Forces officer, he had a rare combination of vision, rigor, and operational grit. He later joined Aleo (a Variant portfolio company) as COO, where he led the team at the frontier of decentralized systems and bleeding-edge cryptography. This isn't  theory for him. It_ mission-critical work  and he_ built his career preparing for exactly this moment.

We_e proud to partner with Alex and the Project Eleven team as they help crypto meet its next great challenge. Quantum won_ arrive with a bang. But when it does come, it will be too late to scramble. The time to harden our systems is now, and Project Eleven is leading the way.",2025-06-19T14:05:00.000Z,13,12,98,0,,neutral,1

https://x.com/jessewldn/status/1947493831491912079,@jessewldn,https://x.com/jessewldn,"Tokens go in and out of vogue every market cycle. 

In a bear, tokens are seen as a category error. 
In a bull, tokens are popular again, usually with a new flavor.

I see some progress in the fact that outside of L1s and the  non-BTC boomer-coin complex, this cycle's most in-vogue tokens are associated with products people use. 

Because people use the products and love them, they  have cash flow, and token-holders are seeing the benefit of that.

I don't think its a coincidence that many of these tokens are built, and in some cases operated by unabashedly centralized core teams, or otherwise very lightly decentralized ones.

Its because its really hard to build a product people want, and near impossible to do it by committee. 

In crypto the phenomena of 'product tokens' started with exchange tokens and is still in early innings of getting iterated on. They likely won't get to final form this cycle, and while they're definitely not without problems, more of their economic activity is happening transparently onchain and thats a step in the right direction. 

So as a directional thought experiment, I find it useful to assume these types of tokens may stick around, because the market values them. Through that lens, is I find it useful to view the popularity of product-tokens as the product and beneficiary of two secular trends:

secular trend #1:
the democratization of investing: 

more and more people want to invest_ot just in crypto, but in stocks, levered ETFs, 0day options, prediction markets, treasury vehicles, perps, etc. 

this is because capital markets are where the average person can access asymmetric economic upside while economic growth is increasingly concentrated in smaller and smaller technology companies. 

people especially want to invest in products and services they love or have communities they love because they want to win-and-help-win. 

secular trend #2:
'live player' founder worship 

investors, especially retail, want to get behind people and ideas who are engaging, and who put numbers on the board. 

this trend really started in Silicon Valley, where founders of in-demand startups, like Zuck, were able to attract investment while retaining corporate control. 

where there's higher trust (e.g. high integrity founders, or more economic activity that is transparent onchain) investors can/could get comfortable with more limited rights. in these scenarios, ownership is more to do with economic alignment vs. more classical shareholder governance models.

so coming back to product tokens, i find it helpful to view them as instruments that principally offer that kind of economic alignment with product growth. users know the product, and they want to own a piece of it. 

yes there are policy implications to this train of thought, but setting that aside and looking purely at the commercial side of it, this is a new asset class that the market wants_nd if we assume markets can reason about risk, then mr. market should be able to price risk of more limited rights/protections. 

on the one hand, maybe these tokens should trade at a discount to equities because the risks are greater and protections lesser, but what we see in practice is the market assigning an ACCESS premium, because never before have retail investors had access to the kind of asymmetric early-stage economic alignment that product tokens offer. at scale, which will win out is a tougher question to answer.

on policy, i would say it simply needs to adapt to this new in-demand asset class, because its not going away. i think its positive that forthcoming rule-making allows the presence of a core team to play a continous role without necessarily making the asset a security, so long as tokenholders have ultimate transparency and control--e.g. cash flows onchain, open source, and can remove that team.

so in addition to decentralized infrastructure and core primitives, i think its directionally positive (though not without risk) the the market is leaning into a new flavor of tokens: product tokens with live players at the helm.",2025-07-22T03:08:00.000Z,11,14,119,1,BTC,neutral,1

But disruptive areas in crypto like stablecoins and infra are shifting from invention to productization, and from ideology to pragmatism.

Historically, disruption is a pendulum that swings markets between open and closed solutions. Tempo is attempting to pick a point in that pendulum with the right mix of open/closed and maximum momentum. 

And my view is it ain't all bad if you care about impact.

From a year ago, on the next 10 yrs of smart contract blockchains:

> In meeting the market on its values, crypto is commercializing. Commercialization...takes good ideas to their largest possible audience, and thereby makes the most impact on the world. And commercialization often comes with compromises. The opportunity is to shape the nature of those compromises, and thereby, the outcome of that commercial impact.

https://x.com/joulee/status/1942600311790789092,@joulee,https://x.com/avichal,"Sundial has raised $23M to build the analytics platform for the AI era!

Our work is personal to me (though many have asked: Why? Aren't you into intuition and taste and experience which is ultimately unmeasurable?)

But hear me out: I love building, and I have a deep respect for it. Making something people love is one of the hardest and most humbling endeavors.

The art comes down to making high-quality decisions, which comes from an obsession with the cliff_ edge between customer understanding and product capability.

You need to know what_ working and what isn_.

That_ why data matters. Data is *information* about how reality works. At Sundial, we live by the mantra: diagnose with data; treat with design.

What does masterful decision-making look like? It comes down to 3 things:
1. extreme alignment
2. shared curiosity to unpeel deeper and deeper layers of truth
3. urgent execution

The very fact is that good intuition and taste comes from data internalized across many, many reps. 

Yes, reality is infinitely more complex than what can be measured. But measuring gives us a better grasp of reality.

Alas, using data well is like learning a new language. It requires years of skill and context building. It's easy to misuse, whether misguidedly or intentionally. I know this all too well.

Mastery requires everything from how to break down an ambiguous question, to fluently reading triangle charts and dense tables, to remembering the specific name of a specific column using a specific dialect of SQL.

Too many people, like me, regularly feel frustrated by 
a) how long it takes to get answers 
b) how to draw the right interpretations 
c) how much noise I have to wade through to find actually actionable insights.

Instead of greater confidence and quality, we get conflicting signals, cherry-picked facts, and analysis paralysis.

Sundial is our attempt to solve those problems.

We_e bottling up opinionated intelligence to guide decision-makers towards faster and more confident decisions. We envision a world where *everyone* can be their own expert analyst.

Sundial uses AI and expert analytical techniques to make insights accessible to every decision-maker. Exemplary analysis takes the listener through a story. Data should speak the language of business, not the other way around.

Sundial is also smart in the ways you_ expect of an AI-native tool. It_ not just about looking up data (_hat_ India ARR last month?), which has become table stakes; rather, Sundial can also tackle deep, complex analysis (_hy did ARR decline? What are my levers?).

In a crowded landscape of fragmented data tools_ashboards, notebooks, ETL systems_undial brings it all together into one intuitive platform.

We believe this era of AI will see teams doing far more with less, and moving faster than ever before.

Our mission is to build the data brain for the next generation of AI-powered companies.

We're thrilled to be backed by @dpatil at GPV_he first U.S. Chief Data Scientist and coiner of the term ""data scientist, alongside industry luminaries like @amasad, @tobi, @fidjissimo, @alexschultz, @shishirmehrotra, @rsanghvi, @avichal, @drewhouston, @howietl and firms including @sequoia, @TribeCapital_,  @sunflowercptl, @Unusual_VC.

some fun facts: uma and i started in 2021 working on zk bridging, until we realized the real problem wasn't bridging itself, it was that using zk was so horrendously complex that nobody could actually build with it.

we pivoted to making it possible to prove any piece of software.

i think we were one of the first teams to show that the risc-v zkvm approach was endgame. it's nice to see teams like zksync, scroll, and even ethereum now agree it's the right approach.

with this mainnet launch, we finally have the ingredients for easy-to-use, low-cost proving that teams need to scale zk in production. i'm also really excited to keep working with the talented hardware teams and provers who are tirelessly pushing to make zk 10-100x cheaper, which should onboard basically every crypto infra protocol to zk in the near future.

Synthetic Dollars aim to generate yield and create stability by executing fully-collateralized delta-neutral trading strategies in financial markets. Ethena generates yield by monetizing the market_ demand for leverage via basis trade.

The most exciting thing about Ethena for us is that it sits at the intersection of three powerful trends reshaping modern finance: stablecoins, perpification, and tokenization.

1. Stablecoins

a) Ethena is the only synthetic dollar to have achieved meaningful distribution and liquidity outside of USDC and USDT. 

b) The true test of a synthetic dollar_ adoption is its acceptance as collateral on major exchanges. Ethena has succeeded in integrating USDe as a core form of collateral on major centralized exchanges like Binance and Bybit.

c) Another unique aspect of Ethena's strategy is its mild negative correlation with Fed Funds rates. As rates fall demand for leverage in crypto generally increases leading to higher funding rates. We have seen a version of this playout in 2021 when the spread between funding rates and treasury rates widened beyond 10%. (chart below)

d) Since inception, the protocol has generated close to $600 million in revenue  with over $450 million of that produced in just the past twelve months.

2. Perpification of Tokenized Equities & Fintechs distributing them to masses

a) Perps are a big market in crypto. In a roughly $4 trillion asset class that is crypto, perpetual contracts trade more than $100 billion per day with an open interest of more than $100B across CEX and DEX.

b) The global equity market is worth around $100 trillion  nearly 25 times larger than the entire crypto market. The US equity market alone is worth around $60 trillion.

c) Just like in crypto, there is strong demand for leverage among equity market participants. This is evident in the explosive growth of 0DTE (zero-day-to-expiry) options, which are mostly traded by retail investors and account for over 50% of SPX options volume.

d) Perpetuals are much easier for most investors to understand than options. We don_ expect perpetuals to replace the 0DTE options market, but they could capture significant market share.

e) As crypto regulations turn more favorable, fintechs around the world should increasingly embrace crypto. Today, most non-crypto-native users can only access a limited set of crypto assets, and only in spot form. We believe this group represents significant untapped demand for leverage.

f) We believe, as fintechs adopt crypto perpetuals, they will create a new distribution channel for these products, driving higher trading volumes and open interest, which in turn will expand the capacity and scalability of the basis trade that supports Ethena.

3. Tokenization

a) Today, access to hedge funds that have the infrastructure to do basis trades at scale is reserved for accredited investors and qualified institutional purchasers. Crypto is rebuilding the financial system from the ground up, making such opportunities accessible to everyone through tokenization.

b) In traditional finance, the closest parallel to tokenization is the ETF. Today, there are more ETFs than publicly listed single stocks in the U.S. ETFs package complex strategies into a single, tradable ticker that investors can easily buy, sell, or hold  without worrying about execution or rebalancing.

c) Ethena is starting by tokenizing the basis trade  but there_ nothing stopping Ethena from diversifying its yield sources over time.

Separately, the team has shown strong execution and risk management culture, and there is a line of sight to value capture for the ENA token.

Team, Risk Management and Value Capture

a) In our experience, Guy has proven to be one of the sharpest and most strategic thinkers in DeFi. The following quote stands out about his conviction in what he is building.

_ quit my job to build Ethena a few days after Luna collapsed and hired the team a couple of months post-FTX.  Guy Young, the founder of Ethena.

b) They have survived the largest hack, Bybit $1.4B and the largest deleveraging event, October 10 crash, in the same year, and did not lose a single dollar. That is a testament to their risk management ethos, which in my opinion are probably the most important factor in running basis trade.

c) There is a line of sight between now and fee switch activation and we believe that would be viewed favorably by the market.

Conclusion

To conclude, we believe that the opportunity for synthetic dollars is massive.

Ethena sits at the intersection of the three largest forces shaping the financial markets: stablecoins, perpification and tokenization, each of which is a source of compounding for Ethena.

They have demonstrated competence in risk management and there is a line of sight to value capture.

- throw away every one of your socks and boxers. buy brand new, all the same color/style. your drawers will never look so good. 

- get a coach for whatever hobby you care about - sports, chess, art, language, it doesn't matter. just pay someone to shortcut your own learning time

- buy an in-home sauna if you have the space. it's  ~$3,000, the same as a high end TV, and if you use it everyday its absolutely worth it

- pay for a personal stylist to redo your wardrobe

- upgrade your zoom setup - nice camera, nice lights, nice microphone. this will boost your perceived credibility more than you think

- pay for your mom/dad/sibling to go on a fancy trip. pay for everything, including flights, hotels, food. it is the single thing that will make you feel like you made it, and the memory will last a lifetime.

- get an inroom IV drip when you travel and watch your jetlag disappear (s/o @calilyliu)

- pay for a 3 hour couple's massage. get the body scrub, it's better than you think.

- buy a package for facials and get one every ~6 weeks

- start getting haircuts every other week. nothing to make you feel fresh like a fresh cut. 

- only travel in nice cars. always get the expensive Uber/Grab/Careem. it will cost you ~$2k extra over the course of the year, but the feeling of luxury is worth much more (s/o @akshaybd)

- get a personal chef to come a few days a week and meal prep for you

- get an at-home massage every sunday

- if you're balding, get a red light hair mask. proven to work, and better to start sooner rather than later

- if you live near family/friends, pay a private chef to make a nice dinner for all of you once a month

- get a personal assistant for shopping, travel, and general research tasks. if you're in dubai or india, @dxbcare is quite good and affordable

- spend less time investing by giving your capital to professionals (liquid, venture, hedge funds, etc). make investing someone else's headache

- buy your wife/girlfriend/mother a new watch instead of buying one for yourself

- set aside a new wallet with a substantial amount of stables, yield farm on @jup_lend, and tell yourself that in 2 years you're going to give it to a family member

- buy a really nice mattress and desk chair and watch your back problems disappear

- send a gift (chocolates, cupcakes, etc) to your friends on their birthdays instead of just sending a text

https://x.com/katie_haun/status/1922838978845343761,@katie_haun,https://x.com/katie_haun,"The U.S. Should Lead on Stablecoins

Stablecoins are to finance what broadband was to the web: the substrate for something much larger. They represent one of the most tangible use cases for crypto_ digital dollar that moves at the speed of the internet, backed by real-world assets like U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds. What began as tools for crypto trading are now rapidly evolving into a foundational layer for global payments.

Stablecoins enable seamless global payment systems that truly meet the needs of a global economy. From major fintechs and traditional financial institutions to multinational enterprises, stablecoins are being used for remittances, merchant payouts, treasury management, and B2B flows, unlocking speed, interoperability, and transparency in ways legacy systems cannot.

They are quickly becoming core financial infrastructure. Citibank recently released a report projecting that stablecoin circulation could grow from approximately $230 billion today to $1.6 trillion (base case) or $3.7 trillion (bull case) by 2030. Citi also estimates that stablecoin issuers could drive more than $1 trillion in net new purchases of U.S. Treasuries by 2030_otentially surpassing any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt.

The financial implications of this shift are massive. New research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that stablecoin flows compress short-term Treasury bill yields, producing effects similar to small-scale quantitative easing, ultimately helping reduce the national debt at a time when it is otherwise soaring. There are also national security implications, given that the current largest holders of U.S. debt are foreign countries with complex geopolitical relationships.

Stablecoins are digital dollars, core payments infrastructure, and increasingly, monetary instruments with global policy relevance. As SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda emphasized this week, tokenized assets offer _reater efficiencies in settlement, recordkeeping, and compliance. Regulatory frameworks should evolve to embrace these capabilities, not resist them.

Legislation like the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act provides the regulatory scaffolding for stablecoin issuance in the U.S., including provisions for audits, 1:1 reserves, and state/federal oversight. This doesn_ just unlock safer onchain activity for existing crypto users; it creates an entirely new avenue for institutional use cases and helps preserve America_ economic leadership in the global financial system.

Tokenization won_ stop at money. The next wave will bring real-world assets (RWAs)_rom equities and bonds to funds and private credit_nchain. Stablecoins have demonstrated the playbook: start with simple, high-velocity use cases, build trust through scale, then extend the architecture to more complex assets.

We are rebuilding the financial system for a digital age from the ground up. This Administration, along with several federal courts, has acknowledged that reality. It_ time for leaders on both sides of the aisle in Congress to do the same.",2025-05-15T02:18:00.000Z,16,29,187,0,,positive,0.6

- MonadBFT, a frontier consensus mechanism featuring 400ms block times, 800ms finality, large globally-distributed validator set, and tail-fork resistance

- Async Execution (while supporting EIP-7702 through the Reserve Balance mechanism)

- MonadDb for efficient merkle trie storage

- Native code compiler for frequently used contracts

- Interconnected community of smart, thoughtful crypto-natives who will grow in influence over the next few years

- Ecosystem of promising young startup founders, ready to take their shot

- Over $100m in ecosystem funding pre-mainnet

- Founder support through DeltaV, the Monad Founder Residency, Monad Madness, and more

Monad has been built painstakingly over the past 3.5 years. We take a long term view and aren_ afraid to do things differently from others.

Today, ahead of the launch of the Public Mainnet, I_ like to share an important element of the Monad tokenomics design: locked MON may not be staked.

Time and time again in previous blockchain launches, the crypto community has had the same complaint: insiders ability to stake and earn rewards (liquid or otherwise) on locked tokens. We heard those complaints and are taking a firm stance on this matter, in an effort to set a new standard for the space.

The north star of Monad is true decentralization. The network will go live with 200 globally distributed validators that are run on consumer-grade hardware. While it would have been easier to cut corners, our team has taken the hard road in designing a system that delivers both performance and decentralization. What we build must stand the test of time. I believe that this firm stance on staking of locked tokens similarly positions Monad toward long-term success through better token distribution.

On a personal note, I appreciate the support of investors including @paradigm, @dragonfly_xyz, @ElectricCapital, and @CastleIslandVC. We build for the long term and are grateful for the long-term-oriented thinking and support of Monad_ earliest backers.

The public sale of MON will go live on Coinbase token sales, a new platform from Coinbase for token distribution, a week from today.

This is the very first public sale that Coinbase has hosted, and it will be made available to 80+ countries, including the United States of America.

7.5% of the total monad supply will be sold at a price of $0.025/token.

At the Monad Foundation, we think big. Over 285,000 accounts were made eligible for the MON airdrop, in an attempt to get people who eat, sleep, and breathe crypto to be the initial stakeholders of the Monad ecosystem. This public sale has the potential to extend the reach of Monad by extending the distribution of MON into the hands of millions of regular people.

This sale is attempting to fulfill crypto_ founding promise: open, fair, and inclusive finance.

Monad was built in part to onboard the general public to crypto, and provide them with the tech that is ready for mass adoption. The world is a big place, and crypto needs to grow far beyond the Crypto Twitter bubble.

https://x.com/L0laL33tz/status/1987982776294162625,@L0laL33tz,https://x.com/punk6529,"Lots of fake news about the EU_ Anti-Money Laundering Package flooded the timeline this weekend, so here_ a quick breakdown of what these new regulations actually mean.

First, the EU *is not* requiring an ID for every bitcoin transaction, as widely misreported. The EU_ AMLR only applies to so-called CASPs, or Crypto Asset Service Providers, which are defined custodians under the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and was adopted 1.5 years ago.

This is bad, because it effectively requires most custodians to KYC their users, which is a major blow to small software firms trying to innovate.

Second, the AMLR requires CASPs to conduct due diligence on any funds that are sent to and from non-custodial wallets below 1000 EUR, and requires a proof-of-ownership of the non-custodial addresses when payments exceed 1000 EUR.

This also isn_ great because it effectively hinders the use of bitcoin as money, but it also isn_ KYC  due diligence is defined as a risk based approach which CASPs have some room to define, s.a. via the use of chain analysis firms. For transactions above 1000 EUR, most CASPs require something called the Satoshi Test, where you make a small tx to the CASP to prove that the address belongs to you.

Again, this isn_ news and was implemented in the beginning of this year via the Travel Rule.

Third, the EU bans cash transactions over 10k EUR for business transactions, but this too is already in effect in most countries, which have bans on cash tx as low as 1000 EUR, s.a. France or Spain.

What *is* new is that the AMLR bans CASPs from offering privacy coins  but some exchanges, s.a. Kraken EU, have already delisted coins like Monero as the EU considers them to be risk carrying assets.

I hope this helps clear up some of the misconceptions and remind you to read primary news sources yourself instead of relying on AI-fueled news aggregators feeding a frenzy for monetized clicks.

The AMLR is an absolute disaster and there_ no need to make it worse than it sounds, because things are already pretty bad in the EU for bitcoin.",2025-11-10T20:36:00.000Z,30,62,359,0,,neutral,0

Find out who YOU are, and do your best to live a life true to your most authentic self.

Don_ try to please others, don_ do what you think you *should* do.

Whether by meditating, walking, journaling, time in nature, etc., learn how to get in touch with what makes you happy and brings you joy. 

This world is full of opinions, people, and things that won't resonate with you. 

So learn how to find your inner voice, your intuition, your true feelings, what makes you come alive, and pursue whatever that is no matter what others think. 

This might sound simple but is harder than you think. The world now offers us so many inputs, it can make it hard to find what is most true inside us. So learning how to clear the clutter and get to that core is something you have to be committed to.

What's funny is that China keeps using more and more energy while getting richer and richer and nobody is going to stop them

And the Western nations have essentially outsourced their pollution to China, so they go down on the emissions charts while China goes up

Nothing actually changes and it's all one big performative act

- obligatory registration of your ID/passport to your chat, email or social media account
- minimum age requirement for chat, email and social media apps of 16 (!)

Don't be that person and don't be that person who blindly leads others. Educate and protect yourself so you can educate others. There are good, honest projects out there and we owe it to ourselves and everyone else to learn how to discern between truth and bullshit.

Don't trust. Verify. 

If the projects vying for your attention and money aren't telling and showing you this by example, be wary.

It has operated continuously for more than a decade, survived multiple market downturns, and consistently delivered on its value proposition: fast, low-cost, reliable transactions. In portfolio construction, Litecoin can be considered as:

_A diversification tool within a crypto allocation, offering exposure to a network distinct from Bitcoin but with a proven security model.
_A lower-beta play on transaction-focused cryptocurrencies, with relatively muted speculation compared to meme-driven assets like dogecoin.
_A long-term store of utility, benefiting from declining issuance and consistent adoption, even amid shifting market narratives.

After the Robinhood announcement, CT did what it does - all the podcasters and naval gazers quickly re-pivoted back to _very institution will launch an L2 & _nsitutions chose Ethereum because Tom Lee. This was always nonsense because Robinhood considered many architectures, not all were L2s. The reality is and has been for a while that there will be millions of blockchains and there will be a mix of  L2s and L1s. It_ also true that many L2s will eventually graduate into becoming L1s.  If you are an institution with what may seem like unlimited resources, the thought of tying yourself and your infrastructure choice to the incumbents seems very risky! What if Ethereum, Arbitrum or Avalanche botches an upgrade and their business is interrupted? For many, this is a show stopper. Remember, there are still so many banks that use on-prem vs cloud

In addition, and I know people don_ want to hear this but, building an L1 does provide the ability to launch a token. The opportunity set of launching a token for an L1 that gets widely adopted is massive. Hyperliquid is a $42B FDV for one use case. How many other levers can a Stripe or Circle pull for that kind of marketcap? This is and has always been a key weakness for L2s and do not try and shill me your committee based nonsense. 

There is a reason Avalanche has built a network that allows for builders and enterprises to launch their own L1 blockchains, there is a market for it! That much is clear as well with FIFA, Maplestory & Gunzilla choosing to build on @avax. While Avalanche was not selected for these two (although it was at the top of the list for one of them), it validates the thesis that there will be many L1 blockchains and Avalanche can power that. It is not uncommon in the beginning of a new market for new entrants to want to build and own the whole stack, but history shows us that this is simply a detour, rather than a lasting trend. Seeing Stripe, Circle and Hyperliquid build their own L1 blockchains is great validation for the thesis that there will be millions of blockchains and Avalanche can power many of them.",2025-08-12T11:55:00.000Z,53,102,407,0,,positive,0.6

_f the simulation theory is true, then it is actually very likely that the most interesting outcome is the most likely. 

Because only the simulations that are interesting will continue. 

The simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're not interesting. 

In this reality that we live in, we run simulations all the time. 

When we try to figure out if the rocket's going to make it, we run thousands, sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which path is the good path for the rocket and where can it go wrong? 

Where can it fail? 

But when we do these millions of simulations of what can happen with the rocket, we ignore the ones where everything goes right, because we have to address the situations where it goes wrong. 

And for AI simulations as well, like all these things, we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us. 

So, if the simulation theory is accurate, then the simulators will only continue to run the simulations that are most interesting. 

Therefore, from a Darwinian perspective, the only surviving simulations will be the most interesting ones. 

And, in order to avoid getting turned off, the only rule is that you must keep it interesting because the boring simulations will be terminated.

A recipient can save the money and take it out when they turn 65.

there_ some confounding narratives at play:
- the magnitude of the capex numbers is enormous and unprecedented - largest infra buildout since WWII
- only supply side is covered, demand side and revenue uplift largely opaque and difficult to untangle even in the pubcos and impossible in privates 
- outside of the headline numbers, minimal insight into the financing structure of these deals

instinct says _ubble territory but this is factually not supported

- return on capital spend is 20-30% annual FCF uplift, this is accretive spend! 
- credit yields on CRE (powered shell), GPUs and internals, and energy systems still healthy and well collateralized 
- GPU depreciation slower than expected, see Google still using 7 year old chips and emerging long tail for compute demand as well as plethora of less performance sensitive workloads coming 

if anything, the bubble is more prevalent in private companies where there is much accounting chicanery afoot (eye popping top line revs but negative EBITDA due to COGS) but this private market is many orders of magnitude smaller and structurally fallout will be constrained to a subset of market participants who will likely be bouyed by winners elsewhere in their portfolios

Let_ look at a simplified example. Picture this: 2 _igh-yield vaults and 2 _rime vaults are allocated across several isolated markets.
Now imagine the collateral in Market C depegs. Both high-yield vaults have exposure to this market and could be affected. The prime vaults, however, would have ZERO exposure and remain completely isolated.
Morpho_ design enables curators to precisely select exposure and tailor any risk profile (from ultra-conservative to completely degen) with greater granularity and efficiency than any other platform. As a result, Morpho may host some of the riskiest vaults in DeFi, but it also offers the safest.

The _rime vaults on Morpho are among the lowest-risk (though not risk-free, again there's no free lunch in finance) lending exposures in DeFi. @SteakhouseFi and @gauntlet_xyz Prime vaults on Ethereum, for example, are exposed to only 3 assets: cbBTC, WBTC, and wstETH. That_ it!

Understanding exactly which markets you are exposed to is critical. You can see the exact allocations of any Morpho Vault directly on the Morpho App btw:
That said, with any model, there are always opportunities for improvement. In this case, it_ about better surfacing risks and making them easier to understand. We recognize this and have already taken steps, such as collaborating with @CredoraNetwork  to offer risk ratings on vaults, and will continue to do so.",2025-11-07T15:50:00.000Z,19,29,124,0,,positive,0.6

the impact goes deeper. most defi works like this: you put up bitcoin or ethereum as collateral, hope it doesn't crash, and borrow against it.

scary for institutions managing billions.

horizon took a different approach:
> use u.s. treasuries as collateral instead
> borrow stablecoins without selling your safe assets
> no more liquidation anxiety

imagine you're running a $100m company. you've got treasury bonds earning 5%.

traditional finance says ""sell some bonds if you need cash."" that triggers taxes and paperwork.

horizon says ""keep your bonds, borrow stablecoins against them."" same liquidity, way simpler.

perfect timing. real-world asset tokenization hit $35.8b this year, almost triple last year's numbers.

wall street institutions like blackrock and jpmorgan are putting their funds on-chain. horizon positioned itself perfectly for this shift and now handles 15% of the entire market.

the infrastructure is reliable too. chainlink handles pricing, partnerships with circle and vaneck expand options, and aave's lending engine has processed $40b in loans without major issues.

what's next? conservative estimates put horizon at $2-5b by 2026.

cross-chain expansion could double that.

institutions are choosing defi over traditional finance. not through hype, but through tools that solve real problems they face daily.",2025-11-09T22:49:00.000Z,20,7,46,0,,neutral,1

Here are the key points: 

On FinCEN_ request for innovative approaches to combat illicit finance in digital assets our message is clear: decentralized digital identity_uilt with privacy-preserving cryptography_an both strengthen national security and protect civil liberties.
��_ Modernize AML/KYC rules: Outdated regulatory frameworks hinder innovation. FinCEN should use their exceptive relief authority to allow financial institutions to adopt digital identity solutions.
��_ Decentralized > Centralized: Unlike traditional identity systems, decentralized digital identity empowers individuals to control their data, reduces cyber risks, and avoids surveillance pitfalls.
��_ Privacy and Security: Technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and multi-party computation (MPC) enable identity verification without overexposing personal data.
��_ Enhancing law enforcement and compliance: Reusable digital credentials could streamline compliance, reduce fraud, and improve the detection of illicit finance_hile cutting costs for institutions.
��_ Public-private collaboration: New tech sprints could create clear, actionable pathways for piloting and approving innovative compliance technologies.

In response to Treasury_ Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for implementation of the GENIUS Act, we support clear, innovation-friendly rules for stablecoins that strengthen the dollar and protect consumers. We recommended:
��_ Clarifying definitions_ecentralized stablecoins  payment stablecoins
��_ Promoting competition and a level playing field
��_ Supporting AML goals with practical, tech-driven solutions
��_ Ensuring tax rules reflect real-world use

As the U.S. implements GENIUS, it has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead in responsible, privacy-first innovation that strengthens the economy and freedom alike, and a balanced GENIUS framework can unlock U.S. leadership in digital finance._ Read our full responses here.�__

It_ time to fix it.

Decentralization should mean the absence of control, not the suppression of ongoing efforts.

Here_ how and why_

Network tokens  tokens that derive substantial value from the operation of a blockchain (eg BTC, ETH, SOL)  can have embedded trust dependencies that result in information asymmetries. 

Where those trust dependencies are minimized, network tokens look like commodities with low information asymmetry risk. 

Where those trust dependencies are significant, network tokens can look like securities with high information asymmetry risk  supporting the use of disclosures requirements under securities laws.

The two primary trust dependencies relating to network tokens are: (1) control and (2) ongoing efforts.
The SEC_ 2019 Decentralization Framework sought to eliminate the risk of information asymmetries by defining decentralization to mean the absence of BOTH control and ongoing efforts. Their reasoning was clear  where network tokens were _ufficiently decentralized tokens functioned more like commodities.

But this is the wrong approach! 

It_ created significant perverse incentives  builders can actually reduce their regulatory risk by abandoning their projects or by masking their ongoing efforts (_ecentralization theater). 

Builders HATE this conception of decentralization.

We need to incentivize builders, not hinder them. A better two-pronged approach can achieve this:

1_ecentralization should be redefined as _he absence of control. This eliminates significant risk and preserves one of the core features of blockchains  they can function without human control. 

2_ targeted and light touch disclosure framework can be used to eliminate information asymmetries that might arise from ongoing efforts.

Collectively, this approach would foster innovation and protect users  ensuring decentralization empowers builders rather than being weaponized against them.

As much as this looks awesome, I want to get excited only, once we confirm this breakout. 

For this we need a weekly candle close above resistance. Almost there!

If we see that I predict a monumental move going vertical. This will for sure lower for the moment the Bitcoin Dominance.

It does not necessarily translate into an altcoin season. However I will keep my eyes open for a small selected Altcoin Portfolio (and will update you if you repost this post).

Please remember this window of opportunity will be small, for the purpose of accumulating more Bitcoin, as Bitcoin IS and WILL REMAIN the King of Crypto.",2025-08-09T04:34:00.000Z,227,524,3089,0,,positive,0.6

Today, we're launching @moremarketsxyz on mainnet with our first flagship earn account: the XRP Earn Account.

This is the first-ever on-chain XRP product with yield sourced from @Ripple's own stablecoin, RLUSD, through protocols like @aave.

@moremarketsxyz_ vision is to open up yield strategies that have traditionally been accessible only to the wealthy and hedge funds.

We chose XRP as the first asset because:

(i) it_ beloved by retail investors,
(ii) it currently lacks native yield, and
(iii) it represents a user base that has been largely underserved by the growing world of DeFi.

We designed the app to be as simple as possible:

(i) You can log in using your social credentials or via @xamanwallet, a well-known wallet brand in the XRP community.

(ii) Once logged in, all you need to do is on-ramp funds and deposit into your XRP account.

Traditionally, these steps would require 34 different front-ends to swap, bridge, and deposit, but @moremarketsxyz handles it all in a single interface, with one button, thanks to partners like @nearprotocol and @wormhole.

Opening XRP strategies to retail is just the beginning. We're already working on several more products, some designed to generate yield on staked assets, others targeting yields not yet available on-chain.

Crypto remains the best vehicle for unlocking financial opportunity, especially for those historically excluded from the privileges the wealthy take for granted.

I'm excited that @moremarketsxyz will play a role in changing that.

- For a lot of people who_e been in bitcoin & crypto for 10+ years, this cycle feels very different and unfamiliar. We_e not seeing new ATHs at the magnitude you_ expect, and many alternative digital assets are at 2022 FTX crash levels.

Two theories resonate with me to explain the current market:

(1) First is the _itcoin is having its IPO momentum argument by @jvisserlabs. he argues that as assets mature, they see a consolidation period where the old guard carefully, slowly exits to make room for new players. The risk profiles of early adopters and more mature-stage buyers are fundamentally different; bitcoin is going through a phase of maturation and a change of guard.

The counterpoint here is that many bitcoin OGs are die-hard fans who won_ sell, but even in circles around me, I_e seen OGs take some profits off the table. So I broadly buy this theory to have merit.

(2) @CryptoHayes recently pointed out how dollar liquidity is drying up until at least the US government opens up again. Even though it might feel like we_e heading towards a bear market, many macro indicators point to more money printing, an increase in M2 supply, and further rate cuts.

The consensus on CT has shifted towards _his cycle is over, and @cburniske was the first to call this. I_ personally more optimistic. I think the bitcoin _PO consolidation will happen faster than tech stocks (like the phases Amazon and Google went through post-IPO), and projects with strong fundamentals that are currently at FTX crash 2022 levels will start picking up some momentum, primarily because there are not many sellers left.

I_ an engineer and not a trader, so take these views with a grain of salt. I_ long BTC and STX (99% of holdings), and am also long SOL and ZEC (Solana is a better Ethereum, and privacy is fundamental).

Markets will do their thing, building long-term value and usage is what matters _��",2025-11-05T14:58:00.000Z,56,56,394,1,BTC,neutral,0.6

Two years' worth of iterations, learnings, ups and downs, and thousands upon thousands of Git commits. When you're building something new, you can get some things right, but you also get a lot wrong. We certainly did.

I've been working on Celestia for 6 years, and have been in crypto for 15 years.

Similarly, Celestia also launched with a ""build whatever"" mindset, trying to be something to everyone, without a clear focus on what kind of chains people were actually going to build on Celestia's high throughput. We burned many cycles going down unproductive rabbit holes.

I previously co-founded Rippling.com (worth $10B+), a B2B SaaS superapp. 0xPPL is backed by top angels including, @balajis @alliancedao @peakxvpartners @anagramxyz @wagmi_vc @Decentralisedco @Joel_john @aeyakovenko @rajgokal @sreeramkannan @akshaybd @sandeepnailwal @Hassan_NY @suji_yan @aniket_jindal08

Web3 is the future of the internet and the trends on these are strong, measured by growth in number of users, revenues, chains or apps. The biggest problem in crypto today is fragmentation. That the users' funds get dispersed and stuck inside these apps across diff chains. The user has to navigate so many diff websites, such as bridges and swap pages to be able to manage his funds and it_ easy to lose track of.

0xPPL is here to solve that.

We index all the blockchains and locate your assets not only inside of the chain, but also inside of smart contracts. We are a full fledged wallet where you can see and manage these funds in one place. No more thinking about gas per chain - we run a gas tank for you. To allow you to withdraw/unstake your funds from within a smart contract, we use LLMs to generate AI adaptors - thankfully crypto is open-source and easy to simulate  LLMs are getting great at interacting with these open back-ends.

Crypto is a very fast moving space and most teams here build something quick and see if it sticks. We deliberately take the opposite approach - to lay out deep engineering on the longer term future vs trying to catch the next narrative. The fragmentation of chains and apps is only going to explode. A universal front-end is both very useful and also for the first time possible due to the intersection of LLM code generation and open crypto backend rails.

0xPPL is a wallet, a portfolio tracker, a bridge, an app store, a community and so much more.",2025-11-11T15:11:00.000Z,156,70,642,0,,positive,0.6

Nivi: For the state of the art on the philosophy of knowledge, which people call epistemology, you can basically skip everything and jump straight to David Deutsch.

Naval: I think that_ right. If you just want to know epistemology, read David Deutsch_ull stop.

That said, for some people it helps to know the history, the counterarguments, where he_ coming from.

The existing theories of knowledge_ike the justified true belief theory or the inductive theory of knowledge_hese are so deeply embedded into us, both by school learning, but also by everyday experience.

Induction seems like it should work: You watch the sunrise every day, the sun is going to rise tomorrow. That just seems like common sense.

So many people believe in that, that if you just read Deutsch, you would see him shooting down these things, but you yourself would not have those things on solid footing. So you might imagine some counterexample exists.

When I first read Deutsch a long time ago I didn_ quite get it. I treated it just like any other book that any other physicist had written. So I would read Paul Davies and Carlo Rovelli and Deutsch, and I would treat them with the same level of contemplation, time, and respect.

It turned out I was wrong.

It turned out that Deutsch was actually operating at a much deeper level. He had a lot of different theories that coherently hung together, and they create a world philosophy where all the pieces reinforce each other.

It might help to read others and not just skip to Deutsch, but I would definitely start with Deutsch. Then, if you_e not sure about it, I would read some of the others and then come back to Deutsch and try again, and then you_l see how he addresses those issues.

Deutsch himself would refer you to Popper. He would say, _h, I_ just repeating Popper.

Not quite true. I find Popper much less approachable, much harder to read, much less clear of a writer. Although I think here both Deutsch and Brett Hall would disagree with me_hey find Popper very lucid; I find him very difficult to read.

For whatever reason, I find Deutsch easier to read, maybe because Popper spent a lot more time elucidating core points. Popper was writing for philosophers. Deutsch is not writing for philosophers. Deutsch is not even writing for scientists. Deutsch is not writing for you. I get the feeling Deutsch is writing for himself. He is just elucidating his own thoughts and how they all connect together.

I also don_ think you_e going to get maximal value out of Deutsch just reading the epistemology, although that is absolutely where everybody should start. That_ the first three chapters of The Beginning of Infinity.

Ironically, in The Beginning of Infinity, the first few chapters and the last few chapters are the easiest and the most accessible. The middle is a slog because that goes into quantum computation, quantum physics, evolution, et cetera.

That_ where I think people struggle because it does require_ot necessarily a mathematical or scientific background but at least a comfort level with scientific concepts and principles. And he_ making a strong argument for the multiverse, which most people don_ have a dog in that fight. They haven_ thought that far ahead. They_e not wedded to the observer collapse theory of quantum mechanics because they don_ really care about quantum mechanics. It doesn_ impact their everyday life.",2025-10-10T04:13:00.000Z,4,16,171,0,,neutral,-0.2

What I got out of reading all of Deutsch was I got to see how his theory all hangs together. Every piece touches upon and relies upon another piece.

He actually came up with the theory of quantum computation and extended the Church_uring conjecture into the Church_uring_eutsch conjecture when he was trying to come up with a way to falsify his theory of the multiverse_hich was a quantum physics theory. And to do that, he had to invent quantum computation, because to invent the experiment for how to falsify the multiverse theory he had to_n his mind_magine an AGI, get inside the AGI_ brain and say, _f that AGI is observing something, does it collapse?

_ut now I need to be inside the brain.

_ell, how do I get inside the brain of a quantum AGI? How do you even create a quantum AGI? We don_ have quantum computers!

_kay, we need quantum computers.

So he came up with the theory of quantum computation, and that launched the field of quantum computing.

That_ an example of how quantum physics and quantum computing are inextricably linked.",2025-10-10T04:13:00.000Z,14,9,169,0,,positive,1

Reading Deutsch across all the different disciplines is very useful. Even when he talks about memes and meme theory_hat comes from evolution, but crosses over straight into epistemology, conjecture, and criticism.

It reaches far beyond his definition of wealth: the set of physical transformations that you can effect. That takes into account both capital and knowledge, and it clearly shows that knowledge is a bigger component. That can be brought into business and applied into your everyday life. It can apply to the wealth of nations and it can apply to the wealth of individuals.

So there are a lot of parts that interconnect.

He says that good explanations are hard to vary. So when you look back on a good explanation, you say, _ell, how could it have been otherwise? This is the only way this thing could have worked.

All these different parts fit together and constrain each other in such a way that there_ now some emergent property or some complexity or some outcome that you didn_ expect_ome explanation that neatly explains everything.

That doesn_ just apply to good explanations. It applies to product development.

Good products are hard to vary.

Look at the iPhone: this smooth, perfect, beautiful jewel. The form factor hasn_ changed that much since the original one. It_ all around the single screen, the multi-touch, embedding the battery, making it fit into your pocket, making it smooth and sliding in your hand_reating the Platonic ideal of the truly personal, pocketable computer.

That product is hard to vary. Both Apple and its competitors have tried to vary it across 16 generations of iPhone and they haven_ been able to materially vary it. They_e been able to improve the components and improve some of the underlying capabilities; but materially, the form factor is hard to vary. They designed the right thing.

There_ a famous saying from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the airplane wing is perfect _ot because there_ nothing left to add, but because there_ nothing left to take away.

That airplane wing is hard to vary.

When we figure out the proper design of the spacecraft to get to Mars, I will bet you that both at a high level and in the details for quite a long time, that thing will be hard to vary until there_ some breakthrough technology.

The basic internal combustion engine design was hard to vary until we got batteries good enough and then we created the electric car. And now the electric car is hard to vary.

In fact, there_ a complaint now among some designers that in modern society, products and objects are starting to look all the same. Is that because of Instagram? Why is that?

Well, at least in the car case, they all look like they_e been through a wind tunnel design because that is the most efficient design. The reason they all look swoopy and streamlined is because they_e all going through a wind tunnel and they_e trying to find the thing that cuts through the air with minimal resistance. And so they do all end up looking the same because that design is hard to vary without losing efficiency.

Good writers write with such high density and interconnectedness that their works are fractal in nature. You will meet the knowledge at the level at which you are ready to receive it.

You don_ have to understand it all. This is the nature of learning. You read it, you got 20% of it. Then you go back through it, you got 25% of it. You listen to one of Brett Hall_ podcasts alongside it, now you got 28% of it. Now you go to Grok or ChatGPT, you ask it some questions, you dig in on some part, now you got 31% of it.

All knowledge is a communication between the author and the observer or the reader, and you both have to be at a certain level to absorb it. When you_e ready to receive different pieces, you will receive different pieces, but you_l always get something out of it no matter what level you_e at, as long as you can even just communicate and read the language.",2025-10-14T17:45:00.000Z,17,24,211,0,,positive,1

Nivi: We_e all seen the pictures of the Raptor engine for the SpaceX rockets, and if you look at the various iterations, they go from easy-to-vary to hard-to-vary. Because the most recent version just doesn_ have that many parts that you can fool around with.

The earlier versions have a million different parts where you could change the thickness of it, the width of it, the material, and so on. The current version barely has any parts left for you to do anything with.

Naval: There_ a theory in complexity theory that whenever you find a complex system working in nature, it_ usually the output of a very simple system or thing that was iterated over and over.

We_e seeing this lately in AI research_ou_e just taking very simple algorithms and dumping more and more data into them. They keep getting smarter.

What doesn_ work as well is the reverse. When you design a very complex system and then you try to make a functioning large system out of that, it just falls apart. There_ too much complexity in it. So a lot of product design is iterating on your own designs until you find the simple thing that works. And often you_e added stuff around it that you don_ need, and then you have to go back and extract the simplicity back out of the noise.

You can see this in personal computing where macOS is still quite a bit harder to use than iOS. iOS is closer to the Platonic ideal of an operating system. Although an LLM-based operating system might be even closer_peaking in natural language.

Eventually, you have to remove things to get them to scale, and the Raptor engine is an example of that. As you figure out what works, then you realize what_ unnecessary and you can remove parts.

And this is one of Musk_ great driving principles where he basically says: Before you optimize a system, that_ among the last things that you do. Before you start trying to figure out how to make something more efficient, the first thing you do is you question the requirements. 

You_e like, _hy does the requirement even exist?

One of the Elon methods in Jorgenson_ new book is you first go and you track down the requirement. And not which department came up with the requirement; the requirement has to come from an individual.

Who_ the individual who said, _his is what I want.

You go back and say, _o you really need this?

You eliminate the requirement. And then once you_e eliminated the requirements that are unnecessary, then you have a smaller number of requirements. Now you have parts, and you try to get rid of as many parts as you can to fulfill the requirements that are absolutely necessary.

And then after that, maybe then you start thinking about optimization, and now you_e trying to figure out how can I manufacture this part and fit it into the right place most efficiently. And then finally, you might get into cost efficiencies and economies of scale and those sorts of things.

The most critical person to take a great product from zero to one is the single person_sually the founder_ho can hold the entire problem in their head and make the trade-offs, and understand why each component is where it is.

And they don_ necessarily need to be the person designing each component, or manufacturing or knowing all the ins and outs, but they do need to be able to understand: Why is this piece here? And if Part A gets removed, then what happens to Parts B, C, D, E and their requirements and considerations?

It_ that holistic view of the whole product.

You_l see this in the Raptor engine design. The example that Elon gives that I thought was a good one_e was trying to get these fiberglass mats on top of the Tesla batteries produced more efficiently.",2025-11-11T16:00:00.000Z,7,10,110,0,,neutral,1

So he went to the line where it was taking too long, put his sleeping bag down, and just stayed at the line. And they tried to optimize the robot that was gluing the fiberglass mats to the batteries. They were trying to attach them more efficiently or speed up that line. And they did_hey managed to improve it a bit, but it was still frustratingly slow.

And finally he said, _hy is this requirement here? Why are we putting fiberglass mats on top of the batteries?

The battery guy said, _t_ actually because of noise reduction, so you_e got to go talk to the noise and vibration team.

So he goes to the noise and vibration team.

He_ like, _hy do we have these mats here? What is the noise and vibration issue?

And they_e like, _o, no_here_ no noise and vibration issue. They_e there because of heat, if the battery catches fire.

And then he goes back to the battery team like, _o we need this?

And they_e like, _o. There_ not a fire issue here. It_ not a heat protection issue. That_ obsolete. It_ a noise and vibration issue.

They had each been doing things the way they were trained to do_n the way things had been done. They tested it for safety, and they tested it by putting microphones on there and tracking the noise, and they decided they didn_ need it, and so they eliminated the part.

This happens a lot with very complex systems and complex designs.

It_ funny_verybody says __ a generalist, which is their way of copping out on being a specialist. But really what you want to be is a polymath, which is a generalist who can pick up every specialty, at least to the 80/20 level, so they can make smart trade-offs.

Nivi: The way that I suggest people gain that polymath capability_eing a generalist that can pick up any specialty_s if you are going to study something, if you are going to go to school, study the theories that have the most reach.

Naval: I would summarize that further and just say study physics.

Once you study physics, you_e studying how reality works. And if you have a great background in physics, you can pick up electrical engineering. You can pick up computer science. You can pick up material science. You can pick up statistics and probability. You can pick up mathematics because it_ part of it_t_ applied.

The best people that I_e met in almost any field have a physics background. If you don_ have a physics background, don_ cry. I have a failed physics background. You can still get there the other ways, but physics trains you to interact with reality, and it is so unforgiving that it beats all the nice falsities out of you.

Whereas if you_e somewhere in social science, you can have all kinds of cuckoo beliefs. Even if you pick up some of the abstruse mathematics they use in social sciences, you may have 10% real knowledge, but 90% false knowledge.

The good news about physics is you can learn pretty basic physics. You don_ have to go all the way deep into quarks and quantum physics and so on. You can just go with basic balls rolling down a slope, and it_ actually a good backgrounder.

But I think any of the STEM disciplines are worth studying. Now if you don_ have the choice of what to study and you_e already past that, just team up with people. Actually, the best people don_ necessarily even just study physics. They_e tinkerers, they_e builders, they_e building things. The tinkerers are always at the edge of knowledge because they_e always using the latest tools and the latest parts to build the cool things.

So it_ the guy building the racing drone before drones are a military thing, or the guy building the fighting robots before robots are a military thing, or the person putting together the personal computer because they want the computer in their home and they_e not satisfied going to school and using the computer there. These are the people who understand things the best, and they_e advancing knowledge the fastest.",2025-11-11T16:00:00.000Z,14,11,128,0,,neutral,1

His point: You can't regulate AI with 300-year-old legal frameworks.

Constitutional committees taking years to decide can't keep up with systems that evolve weekly.

In case you're unfamiliar, in regards to ai agents: Sreeram and @eigencloud work on the verifiable compute layer (trust in what agents do) while we (@Nevermined_ai including our cofounder @dongossen and CRO Josh Wadinski) focus on the atomic commerce layer (enforcement of what agents owe).

The conversation touched on everything from the ""$20 billion trust gap""  between smart contracts and agents to Sreeram's prediction that we'll see the first agent-run unicorn by 2028.

But potentially the most impactful is a realistic framing of blockchain's role in updating digital institutions now and in the future.

They went through the same cycle NFTs did a few years back, and we have officially reached a point of no return. Trading became too efficient, and a minority extracted all the money from traders and retail without giving anything back in return.

I have been trading crypto 24/7 since late 2016, and I can't recall a darker era for this space than the Solana memecoin mania we had. It brought out the worst in people and stripped this space of its soul. It allowed first-cycle scammers to extract millions, and we made complete retards celebrities.

Every day I wake up now and don't have to watch the space glorifying morons and clowns while battling over 20 PVP clones of some racist/dead person token, I feel grateful. Grateful that we are never going back to that again and wondering how we got there in the first place.

There is no belief, conviction, or trust left. 

10/10 kind of sealed the deal - if you aren_ safe on 1.5_ leverage on a multibillion dollar coin and you can get liquidated on a scam wick, then there is no denying anymore that the system is completely broken and rigged against you.

For the last two years, traders have been getting fucked left and right by bot terminals, launchpads, thousands of devs, and braindead KOLs - and in the end, they didn_ even receive a stupid PumpFun airdrop which was part of the tokenomics. It's as if everyone decided that crypto is dying tomorrow, and this is their last chance to grab as much money as possible.

And to close this chapter, we got Solana co-founders 24/7 shilling a fake privacy coin they got for free during a pivotal time for their chain, in the same week $SOL got a staking ETF (while SOL is down 33% this month)

I don't know where we go from here, but I see no light at the end of the tunnel for the Solana ecosystem, and I'm kinda glad that we're going back to recycling DeFi narratives, maybe that sobers us up a bit.

Your memecoins aren_ coming back, and my advice is to start adapting and learning as much as you can, play around EVM ecosystem, and try to find opportunities there before others do. 

If this was your first cycle, I genuinely feel sorry for you. IMO, it can only get better from here. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but better days are coming. If you survived this, you will survive any other cycle.

https://x.com/nic__carter/status/1935414182368674242,@nic__carter,https://x.com/CamiRusso,"in singapore last year i gave a talk called ""cryptodollarization"". the idea is dollarization via stablecoins. now with the GENIUS act about to pass and bessent's comments about stables reaching $3.7T (!!) (13% of M3), i believe stablecoins are being unleashed as an economic weapon to dollarize the rest of the world and help reset the US fiscal position. 

cryptodollarization has happened already, arguably in venezuela, argentina (partial), and nigeria (partial). i believe it's much more aggressive than conventional dollarization, which is often limited by availability of physical banknotes. 

I believe that in a decade there will be many fewer sovereign currencies and most weak nations will be  dollarized  not through USG intervention but by a spontaneous ""bottom up"" process (this happened in Ecuador in 99/20 as described by larry white). in effect consumers engage in currency substitution and force the government's hand. 

stablecoins eliminate the power of borders in currency choice and allow network effects to actually take hold. this is why we see the dollar representing >99% of stablecoins but only 40-60% of international reserves and financial flows. stablecoins make currency substitution must faster and more aggressive, and they are also ~impossible to stop. in almost all cases where nation states have attempted to prohibit flows out of local FX into USD stablecoins, they have eventually relented. 

in my talk I built a simple model to try and guess where these spontaneous crypto-dollarizations might occur (see the last couple slides). 

i wanted to revisit this talk because these predictions have become much closer to reality in the last 12 months. the government is saying the quiet part out loud: stablecoins are an economic weapon to passively dollarize the entire planet.

Accounting is a $500B category, and yet most finance teams are still running on systems built in the 90s. @RilletHQ is rebuilding the financial core of modern companies. We_e rebuilt the general ledger from the ground up to assemble the first AI-native ERP, built for speed, flexibility, and automation.

Since coming out of stealth ~12 months ago, we_e grown lightning fast. We now power the finance stack behind companies like @PostscriptIO, @windsurf, @DecagonAI, @bitwarden and many more across many industries. Windsurf scaled revenue 10x while running global finance with just two people and Rillet. Postscript, with over $100M in ARR and four entities, now closes their books in three days. These are the kinds of results we hold ourselves to.

We_e also partnered with some of the largest and best accounting firms in the country, including @Armanino_HQ, @wissllp and Attivo. The whole industry has been begging for change for decades. With Rillet, it_ here.

This round came together very quickly. The first call happened while I was eating a tuna sandwich in SF (I did not finish it). Three days later, we had a signed term sheet. It was a reflection of the momentum we_e seeing both in the product and in the market. Since announcing our Series A just weeks ago, we_e already doubled our ARR.

None of this would be possible without our team of accountants and engineers. A few months ago, I was still jumping on support calls to help customers. Today, our implementation, success, and product teams are delivering outcomes with the same speed and care that got us here. We originally booked an offsite to celebrate the Series A. In classic Rillet speed fashion, it_ now an A + B celebration. It_ proof of how fast things can move when customers love the product and a reminder of how much this team has earned the chance to celebrate together.

We_e fortunate to welcome @a16z and @ICONIQCapital to the table. @arampell, @seema_amble, @mandrusko1 and @slpierre, @skstebbins bring clarity, urgency and deep conviction about the future of AI and finance.

We_e also grateful to have continued support from our early partners @sequoia, @firstround, @creandum who believed in us from the start, and excited about working with @oakhcft and @FogVentures.

To the Rillet team, again - thank you for building with care, focus, and speed. To our customers - thank you for pushing us, trusting us, and helping shape the product. We are honored to serve you.

In order to do this, they'll need to curate the set down to a much smaller number, which means declining features that aren't ready or aren't the highest priority

Help decide priorities by using the Forkcast Rank page, where you can organize your preferences. It now shows all the proposed EIPs by category: forkcast.org/rank

If you're not an ACD participant, you can still post your list to the EthMag community feedback post - I'll be sure to aggregate the views and represent at one of the upcoming calls.

Today at Acelera, @CamiRusso, founder of @DefiantNews, led a session on Mastering Web3 Storytelling, focusing on how to craft compelling narratives, build a strong brand, and communicate effectively with the press. She began by sharing her background in traditional media and the experience of launching The Defiant.

To break the ice, Cami presented a common dilemma for startups: should founders handle communications themselves or delegate them to PR? The first approach, she explained, suggests that creators should directly communicate their vision, respond quickly to controversies, and shape public perception, building direct relationships with the press. On the other hand, the Media & PR-Led approach, as Cami noted, prioritizes media coverage, enhances reputation and trust, ensures clear messaging, prevents missteps and strategically managed crises_hich allows founders to focus on growth.

Instead of choosing one strategy over the other, Cami recommended a hybrid model: _ounder Heart, PR Head. The founder should drive the emotional side of the story, communicating the company_ vision, mission, and values to build trust. Meanwhile, PR professionals should focus on media relationships, ensuring that messaging is strategic and newsworthy.

Cami then explained what makes a story truly newsworthy. Timeliness, impact, and novelty play key roles, as do prominence, conflict, human interest, and relevance to current trends. She also stressed the importance of proximity and niche appeal, which make a story more compelling to specific audiences.

She highlighted what journalists look for, emphasizing exclusive news, reliable sources, and underreported industry trends. At the same time, she warned against overwhelming them with irrelevant announcements, enforcing embargoes only to see other outlets publish first, or pressuring them to change a story when there are no factual inaccuracies.

When pitching to the press, Cami advised focusing on being useful and building relationships._ She emphasized the importance of understanding what it means to be on and off the record_hat it_ not just a casual conversation between friends, but a journalist_ job. That_ why it_ crucial to be clear about what we do or don_ want to be published. Even when there_ a broader narrative behind the story, it_ key to provide the journalist with off-the-record context and keep quotes short to ensure they stay as true as possible to the perspective we want to highlight.

The talk ended with a Q&A, where Cami offered tailored advice to teams on handling media communications. She encouraged Acelera founders to focus on building first and engage with the press once they have a live product and active users.

The past few months we_e been heads down on completely rethinking the purpose and business strategy of L2 stacks like ZKsync. 

It really comes down to answering the question: _hat is a 10x differentiated product and what will drive revenue back to the protocol?""

The old EraVM lacked performance, devex, and cost efficiency for true differentiation. But it enabled private L2s for institutions, leading to Prividiums which is now a core product now gaining traction with paying customers.

With the Atlas upgrade, however, everything has now changed in our calculus. With ultra-fast proofs, we unlock 10x value for L2 builders and users via seamless L2<>L2 and L2<>L1 interoperability.

Fast L2<>L1 interop solves the cold-start problem which has been the biggest hurdle for L2 teams. No more running the same playbook: Attract devs, hope for a killer app, then spend millions on yield farming that draws mercenaries who dump tokens.

Instead, tap L1's deep liquidity pools directly. Skip vanity TVL and focus on revenue and lower costs. ZKsync Atlas chains will be able to access popular DeFi apps on L1 via our Interop SDK. Demos coming very soon to show that this is real.

This is the 10x moment for ZKsync. This is the moment where L2s no longer look like parasites to the L1 but are composable extensions of it.",2025-11-01T15:35:00.000Z,34,59,384,0,,neutral,-0.2

The fact that only 1 out of ~320 vaults on the Morpho App had limited exposure to xUSD isn't evidence that the model doesn't work  quite the opposite. Morpho's isolated market + vault model meant all 319+ other vaults and their depositors, each with different risk profiles, had zero exposure.

Many assume losses equal system failure. However, in open financial systems, losses are a natural consequence of risk-taking, even when systems operate exactly as designed. As an industry, we should not fall for the fallacy that yield is risk-free. Instead, we should focus on better surfacing and educating about risks  ourselves included.

We just knew that bridging was too damn slow and expensive. And so we set out to fix it. But along the way, the vision has become clearer. It_ more than just cost and speed. It_ global availability, on every chain you want to use. It_ built-in exchange, so you can pay with anything. It_ deep liquidity, that_ there when you need it most. It_ reliable execution, that works every time.

We call the sum of all of these pieces a _ayments UX. If the world is going to come onchain, the experience needs to match or exceed how online payments work today. It_ Relay_ mission to build the liquidity backbone for this onchain economy. To build a multichain payments network.

While many people might think of Relay as an app, there_ so much more going on behind the scenes. The best apps in the space are using Relay to power their consumer applications because nothing else hits the same level of quality on all dimensions. Chain abstraction. Commerce. App onboarding. Swaps. If the experience is delightful, it_ probably Relay under the hood.

For a sense of Relay_ scale, check out the Etherscan tx sender leaderboard. On Ethereum, we_e always in the top 10. On Base, we_e currently number 1, sending ~350k txs in the past 7 days. You won_ see us on the gas guzzlers though, we_e too efficient!

And so, with some newfound clarity, we treat ourselves to a shiny new logo. We hope you like it.

https://x.com/ptrwtts/status/1967909046184448093,@ptrwtts,https://x.com/jessewldn,"In recent weeks, we_e seen a big uptick of claims that _elay is hacked. Obviously, this is something that we take very seriously, and have been investigating.

TLDR: there_ no evidence to suggest an issue with Relay. But there absolutely is an epidemic with compromised wallets, that everyone should be aware of.

Here_ what we_e found, after investigating over 200 reports:

- Almost all victims have compromised private keys or seed phrases. Relay consists of smart contracts and a web app. Neither of these can access your private key, even if they were hacked. Typically these leak when storage is hacked (computer, cloud backup, etc), or the user is tricked into sharing them

- Zero evidence that official Relay products are hacked or involved in a compromise

- Relay has over 1 million monthly users. And yet only a tiny tiny fraction have had issues.

In summary, everything suggests that these users were externally compromised.

So, why blame Relay?

This partly stems from the fact that many victims don_ notice they are hacked, until they use Relay. Maybe they didn_ notice an earlier draining, because it happened in the background. Or maybe the hacker was waiting for the wallet to have sufficient funds before draining it. So when you use Relay, and the funds immediately go missing, it_ natural to think Relay is at fault.

Take this example: bscscan.com/tx/0xb5de4415a80

The user (0x9b) bridged with Relay, but funds were sent to a hacker instead (0xD0). Must be Relay_ fault right?

No!

What happened here is that the user_ wallet was delegated to a malicious 7702 contract, and that contract has a fallback function that immediately sends out any native tokens. The hacker does not even need to make a transaction to drain the user. It happens automatically in the same transaction that tokens are received!

If you look at their past transactions, this is what you see:

02:56:50 AM = call ""check in"" on some contract (possibly related to where hack happened)
02:56:54 AM = account is drained
02:56:55 AM = account delegated to auto-drainer for future
10:55:59 PM = uses Relay and instantly drained again

The user probably didn_ notice the first drain, and so was rightfully suspicious of Relay when their funds failed to arrive in their wallet.

In summary:

- as more people use Relay, more compromised wallets use Relay
- Relay involves sending funds to a wallet, so users are paying attention to their balances
- in addition, hackers often only watch certain chains, or wait for a $ value threshold, and so after using Relay is often when they strike

So, what can be done?

First of all, stay vigilant!! It_ a wild west out there. You should be especially careful with anything that can access your private keys or seed phrase. For example, this tool, which is popular with farmers, was recently hacked: news.risky.biz/risky-bulleti

Second, we are exploring ways to protect our users from external threats, including:
- working with @ChainPatrol to take down phishing sites
- detecting malicious 7702 delegations
- detecting past interactions with known drainers
If you have other suggestions, please reach out

In summary, Relay is safe, and we plan to continue going above and beyond to keep our users safe.

But that doesn't mean it's got everything figured out today, and this week was a good reminder.

Eight observations from this week:

#1: 1 stablecoin != 1 stablecoin. Many different types of products hiding behind the stablecoin term. We need better names to help people understand that each product is different.

#2: 1 curator != 1 curator. Risk models and abilities of different curators can vary wildly. These are all relatively new entities, so nobody has an established track record yet.

#3:  1 audit != 1 audit: Audits and even formal verification differ in depth and coverage. We need to go deeper than seeing a name next to a protocol. Ask the deeper questions.

#4: Protocols need to be careful which curators they work with. Curators don't seem necessarily long term aligned with the underlying protocols themselves. In tough moments curators may do things to protect themselves at the cost of the protocols.

#5: Much of the market does not understand the difference between curators and their underlying protocols. Not crazy given most vault names have both the curator and the protocol in it. That means curator mistakes have protocol brand blowback.

#6: Some of the best potential curators are actually the protocol builders. They know how hard it is to build safely onchain. They can spot sketchy stuff a mile away. The fact these builders cannot serve as curators is a failure in our regulatory rules.

#7: Pegged oracles come back to haunt us again. I understand they are a shortcut. But we should be extremely skeptical. There is likely a hidden risk that is not being priced in for lending markets with pegged oracles.

#8: ETH is a riskier collateral asset in DeFi. When hacks occur, there are no clawback mechanisms, outside of another DAO fork. Stables have some recourse by appealing to circle/tether. I'm not sure that the market has fully priced this in yet.

Each layer we add to DeFi will come with its own problems. No financial system will ever be free of fraud or theft, but onchain transparency means we can spot issues, debug, correct, and fortify faster than ever before. 

It's painful in the moment, but weeks like this only make DeFi stronger -- as long as we take away the right lessons.",2025-11-08T20:30:00.000Z,16,6,40,1,ETH,positive,0.6

https://x.com/rachinkalakheti/status/1966314602251301138,@rachinkalakheti,https://x.com/tarunchitra,"How did we end up polling on Discord for Nepal_ next leader? Here_ a rundown:

tldr; Nepali government was overthrown in 48 hours and I think i just witnessed the first internet native revolution.

Over two decades ago, Nepali citizens overthrew the Monarchy to establish a multiparty democracy hoping for a better future. However, two decades later, the leaders of three major democratic parties, who overthrew the monarchy, were still fighting for power and greed. 

They went from no slippers on their feet to living in lavish mansions, but the common men were still poor, with no sign of improvements.

However, something changed from around late 2010s. People who relied on national TV and radio for their information started getting wide access to internet. People could see every mishaps these politicians made in real time, every frustrated candid stories of every Nepali citizens, and the rapid development of every other country that used to be on a similar level to Nepal. Frustration started accumulating rapidly among people, all enabled by the internet.

Fast forward to around August 2025, Nepali youths, frustrated by the corruption and incompetencies of the government, started a trend on TikTok called ""Nepo Babies"" where they created reels comparing the lavish lifestyle of politicians' kids with common citizens of Nepal who couldn't even afford a proper restaurant meal.

This exposé got widespread traction on TikTok and Instagram, which infuriated all the citizens of Nepal who had already lost hope from the current politicians. Everyone started cyberbullying their kids for their lifestyle.

Coincidentally, Nepali government imposed a ban on almost all major social media sites on September 4th 2025 saying they need to register their entities in Nepal and follow a strict content moderation rule imposed by the government, which obviously, these sites declined to.

The problem is over 20% population of Nepal resides outside the country and suddenly they had no proper way to communicate with their relatives back home. This lack of empathy, combined by the suspicious timing around the rise of nepo baby trend and a long standing disappointment in the current establishment was too much for everyone.

Suddenly, on September 5th, a call for a peaceful protest on September 8th started circulating on TikTok, Reddit, Discord, Instagram, etc.

What_ interesting is, this was a decentralized protest, all organized via internet without any central figure. Since it was organized collectively by youths on internet, this protest was given the title of _en-Z protest.
 
A huge 12,000+ mass appeared on September 8th protest. It started peaceful, but things suddenly got violent. The government gave an order to shoot which led to the death of 20+ people and 300+ injuries by end of the day. Gut wrenching pictures and videos from the protest started floating on internet which led to a widespread outrage against the police and the government.

Later that night, Government gave a very lackluster and apathetic response to such a devastating situation. With this, peace wasn_ an option anymore.

Reddit, Discord, and TikTok was filled with rage and call for revenge on September 9th. People started sharing tutorials on how to create a Molotov cocktail, how to disarm tear gas, etc. This felt like the heat of the moment, but no one expected what was about to come the next day.

Next day, everyone from every part of country started coming out of their houses and protesting against the government. Around early afternoon, news started circulating on internet that a big group was headed towards the house of the Prime Minister. Then another group headed towards another big politician, then another, then another. All of their houses were burnt.

Internet facilitated a realtime coordination for mimetic actions across the nation. This is why _urn their mansions became the trend for the day within a couple hours across the country. Police force, who were already demoralized from last day_ actions and reactions, showed little resistance on this day. 

Almost every major politician_ house was burnt, and many politicians were even beaten brutally by the crowd, on streets, on rivers, and in their mansions.

I was on Reddit and Discord all day. It truly felt like dropping at a warzone where everyone is coordinating attacks, sharing real time updates, and even telling which locations to avoid, etc. By late afternoon, the prime minister resigned and took refuge under the army alongside many other politicians. Army took control for security later that night and wanted to host negotiations with the protestors. 
 
The problem was, there was no representative for the protest. It was all a collective decentralized effort. So people started discussing and polling on Discord and Reddit on who should represent the protestors and who they should nominate as their future leader. 

It_ been a chaotic effort (who knew decentralization would be chaotic), but they_e finally agreed upon who they want to nominate. Discussion between Army, the President, and the protestors is still ongoing, but it_ almost guaranteed now that the leader nominated by the Discord polls will take the position within a couple days.
 
It was an unfortunate event where many things went wrong and the destruction pushed Nepal back by years, but the sequence of events were very unique, where almost everything originated and accumulated from the internet. The dissatisfaction accumulated for years on internet, and suddenly in two days, the government was overthrown, all coordinated via Internet with no central figure. In many ways, the protest happened on the internet for years, but the government didn_ listen. 
 
I suspect this pattern will emerge across many other countries now that the world has seen what_ possible. The Network State is becoming a real thing.",2025-09-12T01:35:00.000Z,316,2555,13191,0,,neutral,1

The breadth and depth of macro/crypto analytics framework I've added since 2021 is massive and I'm happy with the probabilities currently but things can change...

At GMI we have done tremendous amounts of work on this all at the nexus of crypto and macro in The Everything Code. It comprised of over 4,000 charts (serious). 

However, I am not a guru.

We all need to take lifestyle chips off the table to secure our own future.. I can't dictate that. In RV too we will do our best to help as many people as possible,

But we are not, and will not be, perfect.

This is your choice alone. Not mine.

Only you can actually protect your own future and thus limit regret if the market reverses or even it explodes higher.

I'm guessing I'll take 25% to 30% off into year end but I don't know yet. It's based on my own circumstances, not yours and its based on my p&l and not yours.

Also don't forget that your risk profile is different to mine...

I can afford to take outrageously concentrated risks like having 80%+ of my liquid stack in Sui.

But based on my work I think Sui it outperforms most others majors. I am not a maximalist and my portfolio can and will change but I will let you know if my analysis changes.

My job for myself is to maximise profits with best risk adjust returns. 

For most, just buy BTC, ETH and SOL

My job for myself is to max profits with best risk adjust returns I think are available. 

The Banana Zone won't fix your shitty asset allocation. If you have had a decent portfolio you will already be up 5x to 10x from the low.

If you are newer, don't chase gains, time in the market is vital, you should make money this cycle but here is more to play for over time,

You have 5 years or so to Unfuck your Future.

Please don't fuck it up.

This will be my pinned tweet so you can refer to it.

Just let it all play out and take profits on the way.

Good luck. 

My work suggests the next 6 to 9 months can change all our lives but don't bet on it exclusively.

If you want to reduce risk and also play for higher prices consider selling some and buying longer dated calls in due course, where you can only lose your premium (as I did in 2021 with ETH and only risked 5% for a potential leg higher which failed).

I appreciate your attention in this matter.",2025-10-07T02:02:00.000Z,418,527,5656,1,BTC,positive,0.6

The music artist ""Shifty Brent"" is AI and it's incredible... beyond incredible... think of Blaxploitation + James Brown + Sly + Curtis Mayfield.  The AI remixes Rap into the black music rebellion music of the 60's and 70's. 

OK, my mind is blown... the music is exceptional. 

Nothing will be the same again... 

In the future we will interact with AI artists via video chat bots ( we will be their friend and share their AI generated lives and the dram that ensues) and we will see them tour via hologram (ABBA have been doing it for 4 years now).

How we adapt to this amount of change is beyond my understanding but I do know that the equal and opposite force will apply itself and we will crave live, real, visceral  human experiences too and they will be a premium but AI will create new experiences in different ways. Why do you think sports teams keep going up in value? Its a signal.

It really is us adapting to new apex species and reorganizing society.

If global liquidity is the single most dominant macro factor then we MUST focus on that. 

REMEMBER - THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN IS ROLLING $10TRN IN DEBT. EVERYTHING ELSE IS A SIDESHOW. THIS IS THE GAME OF THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

Currently the gov shutdown has forced a sharp tightening of liquidity as the TGA builds up with no where to spend it.

This is not offset by the ability to drain the Reverse Repo (it is drained). And QT drains it further.

This is hitting markets and in particular crypto which is the most liquidity driven. TradiFi asset managers have had one of their worst years of performance vs benchmark and are now having to chase markets and that is allowing tech to be more stable than crypto. 401K flows help too. If this liquidity drain keeps going longer, stocks will get hit hard too.

However...

As soon as the gov shutdown ends, the Treasury begins  spending $250bn to $350bn in a couple of months. QT ends and the balance sheet technically expands.

The Dollar will likely begin to weaken again as liquidity begins to flow. Tariff negiotiations will have largely been completed, removing uncertainty

Ongoing bill issuance increases, adding more liquidity via bank balance sheets and money market funds (and stable coins).

Ongoing rate cuts (we will have economic weakness from the shutdown that will add to the evidence that rates need to come lower but no, there is no recession).. 

SLR changes free up more of the banks balance sheets allowing for credit expansion.

The CLARITY ACT will get passed, giving the crypto regs so deserately needed for large scale adoption by banks, asset managers and businesses overall.

The Big Beautiful Bill then kicks in to goose the economy into the midterms. The entire system is now being geared toward a strong economy and strong market in 2026 for these elections.

China will continue to expand its balance sheet. Japan will work to strenghten the Yen, and also fiscally stimulate.

The ISM will rise as rates fall and tarrif uncertainty drops away.

You just need to get through the Window of Pain and The Liquidity Flood lies ahead.

Always remember the Dont Fuck This Up rules...and wait out the volatility. Drawdowns like this are common place in bull markets and their job is to test your faith. 

BTFD if you can.

Expect a few days for TGA spending to begin to significantly add to liquidity and should persist for several months.

Obviously, QT ends in Dec and the balancesheet will crawl higher.

We should see the dollar begin to weaken again.

The next key step is to avoid a Year End funding squeeze. Expect several ""temporary"" measures to add liquidity. Term Funding and SRF operations are most likely.

That will eventually morph into the desperately needed changes to the SLR to allow banks to absorb more issuance and re-lever their balance sheets. This is a big liquidity bazooka. Expect in Q1.

SLR should lower rates as banks buy more bonds.

Also expect CLARITY Act for crypto to begin to get finalised.

There will also be stimulus payments and the Big Beautiful Bill fiscal goosing.

China will contonue balance sheet expansion. Europe will add fiscal stimulus or extra spending.

The debts must be rolled and the Gov wants to super heat the economy into the Mid-Terms.

One thing I noticed is that we all share the same struggles, worries, and concerns but we also feel the same passion, love and conviction.

This new series we created shows the human side of our great ecosystem.

Along with my friend and director of the series @dave_krugman, we want the world to see the storytellers building our community; not for the price of their art but for their spirit and essence.

This pilot episode features Erick (@artonblockchain)

Together we explore Erick_ love for art, his deep connection to Marfa and how he made it a home for his family and @artblocks_io

Joined by friends @toadswiback and @glitchmarfa 

Thank you to @vslav_eth for helping produce this project. He is a true patron of the community and tremendous builder.

And finally to our producer @riasuth, for being the glue that makes this magical thing possible.

We hope you all enjoy and come back for more soon. The more interest we can show the more we can make, so please give this a share.

Access to capital is a huge barrier for retail crypto traders. This forces them to choose between trenches or irresponsibly high leverage. There_ a better way.

Crypto trading is evolving from a monolithic, collateral-heavy world to a modular, capital-efficient future. Just as DeFi unbundled exchanges into primitives_MMs, oracles, lending markets_e_e now seeing the capital stack itself rearchitected.

The old way? On traditional venues you front the capital and take all the risk. Leverage amplifies both gains and catastrophic losses. It's a system designed to bleed most traders dry.

@Breakoutprop has a different model. They_e pioneering this shift by rewriting the trading capital structure stack by allowing users to trade with capital_ot against it.

Instead of your capital at risk, it's theirs. Traders bring the skill, they bring the capital. Both share the trading profits. Pass the evaluation, and traders get access to house money and no liquidation anxiety. 

It_ a structure that flips the script: risk is externalized, alpha is rewarded. The structure prioritizes upside for performance. Better traders can fast track their portfolio growth without resorting to high leverage.

What Breakout is building isn_ just a funding model; it_ a new financial primitive that slots cleanly into the emerging modular trading stack. Think: execution layer, perp infra, and now  capital-as-a-service.

Breakout accounts scale up to $100K in size (with max combined capital of $200K), and traders can access 5x leverage on BTC/ETH and 2x on altcoins. In practice, that means <$1K in evaluation fees can unlock up to $500K in buying power_ithout debt or collateral. Both traders and Breakout win, when traders win, but traders keep 8090% of profits, benefiting from instant, unconditional withdrawals. The model rewards precision over risk, and talent over bankroll. 

In a world moving toward unbundled infrastructure and composable finance, Breakoutprop is a bet on crypto-native trading capital structures. We believe this is how trading should look: permissionless access to capital, aligned incentives, and modular design.

Attending the 2025 Litecoin Conference this year wasn_ just a curiosity or a calendar filler. I_ deeply invested in Litecoin, literally. My mining operation is rooted in Scrypt, with #Litecoin and its merge-mining counterparts at the center. And while I believe in the long-term utility of the project, it has underperformed compared to other areas of my portfolio. That_ not a reason to walk away; it_ a reason to dig deeper.

Like any serious investor or business operator, I understand that performance alone doesn_ always tell the whole story. This year_ conference offered a rare opportunity to be on the ground, face-to-face with the builders, partners, and community members who are shaping Litecoin_ and $LTC's path forward. I came with an open but critical mindset. I wasn_ looking to be impressed. I was looking to be convinced.

And what I found was more than reassuring. It was reinvigorating.

There were plenty of insightful presentations, partnerships, and ideas worth talking about, many of which I_l cover in the days ahead. But one moment, and one person in particular, set the tone for everything else I experienced: Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ creator.

The Critic in Me Was Ready
Let me be clear: I don_ blindly follow any project. Over the years, I_e walked away from more than a few. I_e been in business long enough to know when something doesn_ pass the eye test. And in crypto especially, the founder can tell you a lot, whether they mean to or not.

The opening keynote was delivered by Charlie Lee, Litecoin_ founder. I had seen him before in interviews and podcasts, but this was my first time seeing him live. It gave me a new lens, one that revealed more than any soundbite ever could.

Sincerity Over Showmanship
What Charlie delivered wasn_ a performance; it was genuine. And that distinction matters. In a space where strong public speakers are surprisingly rare, his sincerity stood out. Most crypto founders don_ even take the stage themselves. When they do, it_ often a letdown. I_e sat through more than a few keynotes where I left wondering how that person ever managed to lead anything.

So while I wasn_ entirely surprised by Charlie_ underwhelming stage presence, it still left a mark. He wasn_ theatrical. He wasn_ trying to sell a dream. Instead, he delivered a kind of calm, understated clarity. It didn_ come off as scripted. It came off as real.

As someone who_ started businesses, faced setbacks, and had to pitch and present in tough rooms, I_e learned to look past polish and see what_ underneath. And what I saw in Charlie was someone who still deeply cares. He has no obligation to be here. He_ already succeeded. Yet here he is, contributing, showing up, and helping guide the next phase of the project he started.

Reading Between the Lines
Later in the event, I had a short conversation with Charlie on the sidelines. It only confirmed what I had already picked up from his keynote. He didn_ try to impress me. He didn_ pitch. He just spoke honestly.

People still criticize him for selling his Litecoin holdings back in 2017. But they miss the context. He didn_ award himself a massive pre-mine. He mined or purchased his coins like anyone else. He sold some when the market peaked, just as many responsible business owners and investors do.

What matters more is what he did afterward: he stayed.

He didn_ disappear. He didn_ wash his hands of the project. From what I can tell, he_ still helping to fund events like this one. He_ still building relationships. He_ still working to move the protocol forward. And that, in my view, is far more telling than any coin balance ever was.

The Bigger Picture
Litecoin is often misunderstood. Critics love to call it a #Bitcoin clone, a second-tier asset, or simply irrelevant compared to $BTC. But that perspective overlooks its purpose. Charlie didn_ create Litecoin to compete with Bitcoin. He created it to complement it.

It provides faster transaction times, lower fees, and a reliable testbed for innovation. It has weathered market cycles and FUD campaigns. And it_ still here, still functioning, and still finding ways to be useful in a maturing crypto ecosystem.

This conference reminded me of that. And it did more than justify my continued investment. It recharged it.

So What_ Next?
Over the next week or so, you can expect a series of write-ups from me covering my takeaways from many of the presenters and panels at this year_ Litecoin Conference. I_l be diving into the technologies, ideas, and insights I believe are poised to make real impacts in the market. I_l also explain why Litecoin deserves a fresh look from those who may have dismissed it in the past due to price action alone.

Litecoin has grown far beyond its early label as a Bitcoin fork or copycat. It is maturing into a monetary technology with its own identity. In my view, it is positioned to become a major force in the next phase of the crypto cycle.

Signs of that shift are already appearing, not in headlines, but in partnerships, protocol development, and growing institutional interest. Litecoin isn_ waiting for permission to matter again. It_ already building toward it. And after this conference, I_ more convinced than ever that it_ worth paying attention.",2025-05-30T20:51:00.000Z,59,107,394,1,BTC,neutral,1

in the past year, the average value of stablecoins that moved on LayerZero's infra was ~$57k

with the eigenzero dvn, if that amount is ever lost due to verification issues...the user gets a full refund

I think this will also help increase the message count on LayerZero as users will want to match the amount staked per move to be 100% covered

e.g if the total amount staked in eigenzero is $5M....every crosschain move would be <= $5M

this helps lz protocol as its not a bps fee protocol but earns/message

more messages = more revenue

so that lump sum of $800M that moved last month would probably be 40 messages of $5m

Are you surrounded by the right people today? Are you in the shape of your life already? IMO, it is also important to surround yourself with people who have visions outside of wealth building, because the fact is that your life is pretty optimized on this already. Begin by identifying what truly matters to you. Consider your core values and your passions.

How do we get ETH to $20k?

Fee value accrual obviously isn't necessary to drive the required public confidence for a high token price, otherwise BTC would be worthless because 99.999% of BTC activity is centralized and doesn't accrue value to bitcoin.

So, while strong value accrual isn't necessary for a high token price, might it be sufficient?

If eth had 18% deflation per year because L1 apps and L2s were burning so much ETH, it's pretty hard to imagine a scenario where this high level of deflation wasn't accompanied by similarly high level of confidence in ETH and thus a high token price. That's why strong value accrual is likely sufficient in practice for a high token price. Ie. it's not that high fees create a high valuation in a cash flow/DCF sense - it doesn't work that way - rather it's because high fees tend to coincide with high confidence in the platform.

Might there be another way to drive confidence besides having high fees? Could we get ETH to $20k without getting back to high total fees?

Maybe we could imagine a scenario where we attracted $1 trillion in stablecoins to the L1, and confidence in ETH moons, but total fees are still low for some reason. This kind of fictitious scenario is highly unrealistic because most kinds of growth will tend to increase fee levels, directly or indirectly. If we attract $1 trillion in stables, fee levels would probably be high already. In fact, a lot of those $1T in stables likely would have joined the platform because of other kinds of growth that increased fee levels.

Ultimately, realistically for ethereum, getting back to high fee levels is both necessary and sufficient to reach a high ETHBTC ratio and moon price for ETH.

One way raise fee levels would be to try to take a knife to our nascent L2 model and carve up some new economics to ""make L2s pay their fair share"". This would be an unwise approach at least because it epitomizes a lack of confidence and impatience in our L2 model.

The other way to raise fees, and the only practical genuine option available to ethereum, is with huge growth.

We need
- more L1 apps (and more distribution of L1 assets/services to all L2s; ""hub AND spokes"")
- more L2s (and more business model diversity)
- more cross-L2 services (see Aztec exporting privacy as a service to other L2s)
- more growth in existing L2s (they're working on it)
- more blobs for L2s to buy (incoming, and an aggressive goal for fusaka this year)
- more L1 blockspace for L1 apps and L2s to buy
- and way more real world builder culture+growth programs for us to get out there, connect with the world, and frontrun the next big areas of opportunity to actually help people and build the ethereum economy

In short, Ethereum does not have a value accrual problem, we have a growth problem. 

Eth mainnet turns 10 this summer. We've come far in our first decade. We're by far the largest chain as measured by app capital and unique integrations/serious apps. That's great, but as this year has shown, we're not nearly done yet.

To get ETH to $20k and Ethereum to global ubiquity, the time is now to 100x our focus on real world growth.

Only real world growth will actually grow ethereum, restore high fees, and send ETH to the moon. LFG",2025-03-29T20:09:00.000Z,60,78,549,1,BTC,positive,1

BUIDL fees dropped from 50 bps to 20 bps for those chains (and Solana) vs Ethereum - that's $4.5m in annualized savings on $1.5 billion.

I don't have insider baseball on this but it's likely BlackRock didn't cut fees because Larry's feeling generous.

A simple theory:

Aptos, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche are paying BlackRock incentives for this privilege - or else, why only those chains at 20 bps while Optimism and Arbitrum are 50 bps?

If you're Avalanche with rich AVAX treasury would you pay a couple million to BlackRock in exchange for #2 on the RWA t-bill charts?

Uniswap did the right thing. It kept a promise. It restored something we_e been missing for three years:

Belief.

Since 2022, the nihilist crypto narrative has been winning:

- everyone_ here to f**k you over
- no long-term assets, only trades
- every founder rugs
- fundamentals are a meme

No crying in the casino.

They had the receipts.

SBF, Do Kwon, Mashinsky. DAO utopianism. NFT mania and collapse. Rug after rug. The cynicism was earned.

And while we tried to rebuild, even our golden child DeFi protocols seemed to abandon us.

Uniswap - when fee switch?

Silence.

Uniswap Labs ships a wallet to collect fees for itself.

When fee switch?

_ever.

They said UNI was just a long rug by Hayden & the VCs. Why share fees with holders when you can dump UNI and keep the revenue?

The counter-take was always: regulators, Gensler, bad environment, timing.

Nihilist crypto called it cope.

And as the months dragged on, even believers lost faith.

Then yesterday Uniswap flipped the script:

- Fee switch activated
- All protocol fees to UNI burn
- Labs + Foundation aligned
- 100m UNI burn to make up for lost time

Nihilist crypto was wrong.

The OG DeFi protocol choose the long game over the easy money.

Delayed by Gensler. Not defeated.

UNI just injected a little belief back into our jaded souls.

I needed it. You probably did too.

Some founders are still here for the long game.

So are some investors.

We might find out soon.

Kyrgyzstan (the country) is launching a gold backed stablecoin.

USDKG will be denominated in dollars but backed by gold. Not back by treasuries. Not GENIUS compliant. 

Why gold?

Because Kyrgyzstan is relatively gold rich.

- 40 tons in the vault
- 30 tons exported per year
- 1,000 tons in the ground

And maybe, more importantly because gold can't be sanctioned or frozen by the U.S.

I don't expect the U.S. to love USDKG

First, it uses the dollar as the unit of account - but gold as the store of value. Some might call this parasitic to dollar demand - it leeches off the dollar brand for distribution without increasing demand for dollar instruments.

Treasury Secretary Bessent wants to sell more treasuries - but USDKG takes from dollar demand and sells more gold. He won't like this.

Second, Kyrgyzstan is friendly with Russia. Hosts Russian military bases. Has had many banks sanctioned from SWIFT.

I'm assuming a sanction resistant stablecoin is the implicit founding mission of USDKG (of course they're not admitting this).

If that's right - what could the U.S. do to stop USDKG?

Unlike Tether, Kyrgyzstan is an independent country in an adversarial sphere of influence. Assuming they can't cow the gov into submission, they can OFAC sanction addresses holding USDKG.

That would stop USDKG in Coinbase. But it wouldn't stop USDKG on decentralized networks or DeFi or peer to peer transactions.

So USDKG really could be used to route around SWIFT. Just as bitcoin and ether can.

And if it's successfully, should we expect larger countries to launch their own gold backed stablecoins - India, China, Brazil?

I think the answer is probably yes.

You can already see the outlines. Community Notes has become table stakes on X because a crowd that explains_why_a claim is misleading beats a mystery box. Stack Overflow_ accepted answers turn help into legible signal. Subreddit mods use templates and rules to keep a vibe. Prediction markets turn _ think into __ willing to stake this, and suddenly the fog around breaking news thins.

This is curation surfacing as an act of rebellion. A single company or individual should no longer be the lone tastemaker. Groups and communities are turning the tides around. Even if they lack the distribution, they are willing to fight to become the destination which in turn would bring back the pendulum of attention.

The ad-based internet priced attention. It did not price participation. Now we sit between two worlds. On one side, global feeds that maximize scroll. On the other, an emerging stack where open social graphs, onchain markets and verifiable compute can make community judgment legible. Crypto_ early experiments hint at it. Token launches try to reward the right people but recreate the same problem: no shared, verifiable way to tell signal from noise. Onchain data tools show fragments of the solution, but the algorithms are private and incentives still flow through platforms with no agency towards the communities they serve.

If we want a better web, we need to lean in and explore curation as an integral form factor. Communities should get a viable way to not only coordinate, curate and create value. But also capture and distribute value to participants. And this is my hope and aspiration for crypto - to serve as the plumbing that powers new coordination mechanisms and business models on the Internet.

This is the narrow path we are building toward. We built @openranknetwork, a reputation protocol, to help differentiate signal from noise on the internet. It helps bring reputation scores and ranking to social apps, crypto wallets and tokens, in a verifiable way.

We_e now built a community-first social app, @cura_network, where every community owns its feed, its rules, and its rewards. Think of it as a sovereign client for your corner of the internet. You get a homepage you can tune, a leaderboard you can defend, and a wallet you can use to pay contributors on a schedule you set. The point isn_ to replace your Discord, or your X timeline. It_ to give you a_home_where the best of your community accumulates, and where the judgment behind it is legible.

Under the hood, Cura runs on_open protocols. We use_@farcaster_xyz protocol for reading/writing open social data; OpenRank_to turn raw signals - follows, likes, replies, link quality, onchain actions, into_a community_pecific algorithm; @eigenlayer to make the OpenRank compute verifiable. Each ranking produces a cryptographic commitment and an onchain trail so that communities get full agency on the algos that power feeds or distribute money.

we_e just getting started on bringing curation back to the internet.

Inversion is here to change that. We don_ pretend to convince businesses, we will acquire and transform them. Berkshire onchain.

We_e on a mission to build the largest and most economically thriving chain. We care about one thing: real GDP onchain _

We know that businesses can radically improve their operations and performance by moving onchain. Inversion chain will be tailored to fuel the world_ first crypto-native private equity strategy, acquiring traditional businesses and anchoring them on our chain.

The tech is ready

If you_e still reading, here_ the call to action:

I_ looking to hire the most cracked CTO and Chief of Staff. These will be the first two hires at Inversion.

CTO: if you_e built truly magical stuff, I want to talk to you. You may be on the fence or think this is just another chain. Hear me out. I_l make it worth your time._

Chief of Staff: you_e going to be involved in everything. You anticipate, you solve, and you_e a much better version of me.

I only want to hire A+ talent. A+ talent hires other A+s._

If you know someone that fits this description please send them our way. We will pay $30k for referrals we hire.

We have a long way to go...

We need to fix market structure - how onchain and offchain worlds connect in a 24/7/365 global internal capital markets

Events like last Friday also expose an over reliance on speculation as the primary driver for this industry

And while speculation is a necessary precursor to catalyze any technological revolution, we are selling ourselves short as an industry by leading with 50x leverage products

Is that the best we can do?

We need to play long term games and focus on delivering extreme value to end users

The casino and zero sum games is not going to cut it

The exciting part is that we've already built groundbreaking technology:

Stablecoins - programmable money - will completely change consumer finance for the better

Global internal capital markets will boost economic growth and productivity supplying capital to places that don't have it, and create more competitive and transparent markets

The end customer will win

If five years from now more than half of all onchain activity isn_ tied to real economic output - real GDP, not speculation - then we_e failed

We won't have anyone to blame - not regulators, not market markets, not exchanges - no one but us

It's time to wake up and be the industry we want to become

It_ what makes us human. It_ how we evolve and survive as a species.

But techno-optimism has a twofold risk:

1) Optimism without pragmatism

No - just because you build it doesn_ mean they will come.

Too often, tech fails not because it_ bad, but because it_ early. Wrong form factor. Broken go-to-market. Requiring too much from the user.

The first cars were dangerous and unreliable.
The first smartphones were slow and niche.

What changed? Apple didn_ just make a phone - it bundled music, design, and intuition. Jobs understood human behavior as much as he understood technology.

Ken Kocienda, who built the iPhone keyboard, obsessed over how people actually type: imprecise, fast, emotional.

He realized forcing precision was the wrong goal. Instead, he built the illusion of it: even if you hit slightly off, the software predicted what you meant to type.

The magic wasn_ in accuracy - it was in confidence.
Typing on glass suddenly felt natural. You trusted the machine.

That_ the key: great technology meets people where they are, not where we wish they_ be.

2) Forgetting that human nature doesn_ change

As Morgan Housel writes in ""Same as Ever,"" technology evolves, but people stay remarkably consistent. We still want to be respected, loved, and safe.

We still chase status, overestimate control, and tell ourselves stories that make sense of chaos.

We still get greedy in booms and fearful in busts.
Compounding - in money, relationships, or knowledge - always works the same way: small gains over time lead to massive results. Yet we_e still too impatient to wait.

The most successful builders know this. They design for what doesn_ change - the emotions, incentives, and stories that have driven humans forever - while leveraging what does change: the tools (technology).

Because while technology changes fast, people change slowly.

I_l always bet on technology.
But I_l never bet on human behavior changing.

Does the world happen to you, or do you happen to the world?

Most people wait for permission to solve problems. The subtle message they send is ""I don't care enough to solve this on my own. Tell me what to do."" The world happens to them.

High agency people are different. They care. And because they care, they solve problems without being told. They happen to the world.

High agency people act like owners. Owners see a problem and fix it. They don't wait. They don't need permission. They don't think this is someone else's job. They don't think this is hard. They don't think ""I can't do this, I've never done it before."" They don't think this is someone else's job.

It began with 8 hours of zone-based cardio a week (riding a bike outdoors) which then turned into 4 hours of cardio and 4 hours of weightlifting a week around 2 months ago.

My diet is also tuned to maximise necessary macros and I track absolutely everything that I eat (as almost all of my meals are cooked by me). This is honestly the most important part of any fitness journey - especially in today's world where so much of our food is incredibly unhealthy for us.

I also used the Whoop fitness tracker to keep me accountable - not a shill but it changed the game for me - I treated it like a 24/7 personal trainer.

Here are the results after 7 months (height is 172cm and age 33):

Weight: 84kg/185lbs down to 69.6kg/153lbs
Body fat: Over 25% down to ~19% (I get a DEXA scan every 3 months to track this)
Resting heart rate: 60bpm down to 50bpm
VO2 Max: 54

I have never felt better in my entire life and pretty much all of the pains/aches that I felt as I entered my 30's have disappeared. I have more energy, I sleep better, I'm never tired during the day, my mood is stable and I'm just overall much more happy. I also look very athletic/toned and I can see my abs for the first time in probably 20 years!

Of course, the journey isn't over - my goal from here on out is to get my body fat % down to at least 15% and build much more muscle while still maintaining a healthy dose of cardio.

Now, given this newfound energy, I took on a new project 2 months ago. It's completely unrelated to crypto and Ethereum and I haven't been this excited to work on something in a very long time. I'll announce what the project is once I am close to finishing it :)

Anyway, I highly recommend taking your physical (and mental!) fitness seriously if you aren't - the results after even a couple of months will shock you!",2025-11-02T21:23:00.000Z,161,36,1297,0,,neutral,-0.6

I first contacted Coinbase initially not about a job but, of course, to ask if they would support Litecoin. Olaf @zxocw responded and said they are Bitcoin-only for now as they have limited resources, which made a lot of sense.

A few weeks later, my sister was looking for a job and I introduced her to Olaf. She wasn't super interested as she was thinking of starting her own startup. But my conversation with Olaf eventually led to him asking why don't I go in for an interview. At the time, I was working comfortably at Google, but Google had no interest in doing anything with crypto. So I decided why not.

At my interview, @brian_armstrong and @FEhrsam asked me quite a few tough brain teasers and coding questions. They didn't know I could do brain teasers in my sleep. _ The interview quickly went from trying to test me to trying to sell me on Coinbase. It actually didn't take much to sell me. I get to work on crypto full time, working with super bright and talented people, and building a company that is trying to change the world of finance.

Coinbase made me a decent offer, but the pay was a lot less than my pay at Google. I decided to negotiate for more salary instead of more stock, because I wanted Coinbase to at least match my Google salary of $150k. Not negotiating for more COIN stock was the single worst financial decision of my life! _

https://x.com/Schlagonia/status/1985828897989279901,@Schlagonia,https://x.com/Arthur_0x,"172 days ago the Stream team messaged me to complain about a snarky tweet I had made about their vault code.

This was the last message I sent them.

Obviously they did not listen and we are in fact worse off because of it.

Contrary to what many seem to feel, none of what happened came out of nowhere. As with any good bubble/blow up it has been slowly brewing and was simply a matter of time till it burst.

It took one conversation with their and 5 minutes of scrolling their Debank to realize that this was going to end poorly.

And while Stream was the most egregious, they are far from the only ones out there with bodies to hide.

So while I have my 15 minutes of CT's attention here are a few long, but hopefully final, thoughts on our latest saga.

First on Stream in particular.

Even I was surprised at the size of their loses, and while we wait to see what the official reason for the hole is, I think its pretty obvious you don't delegate 9 figures of user capital to ""external managers"". And the only way you loose that amount of money is leverage trading shitters.

Seems clear these kids started directionally trading with user capital while lying about it. This isn't a phenomenon unique to DeFi, it's a tale as old as time. And ironically one of the primary original selling points of the benefits of DeFi, to not allow this.

Nonetheless, I still don't think the market has fully grasped the extent of the insolvency. At time of writing this xUSD is trading at about $0.25 or 20% of its PPS of 1.27 and deUSD is at $0.99 still. So lets do some math.

If we look at the current state of Stream's assets their total DeBank bundle claims $138m and liabilities of their dashboard says $160m of user deposits.

However,  seams safe to write off all of the value in 0x15 at this point, given its almost all xUSD and deUSD levered positions that they have no ability to ever unwind. And assume their new msig 0x14b is all of the returnable funds which is currently $63m.

Then we come to the liabilities, which is where the recursive looping and unbacked minting kicks everything up. Since they have no viable path to repay their xUSD loans we can assume that all will eventually end in liquidation in some capacity. Which given the limited on chain liquidity likely leads to lenders taking possession of the xUSD posted as collateral, which fully breaks their recursive accounting and causes a 2X+ of the outstanding xUSD liabilities and creditors that will be looking for repayment and redemptions.

My best estimate from Debank is they have a total of close to 300m xUSD currently leveraged across their wallets. At current PPS of 1.27 this increases their outstanding liabilities by about $380m to $540m.

Which would then give an expected redemption value of 63/540 for close to a 90% loss or $0.14 per xUSD.

Of course this also means deUSD will take at minimum 20-30% bad debt, assuming their 1:1 agreement won't hold up given Stream doesn't have enough to pay Elixir back in full even if they did abide by it.

And anything lent or backed against xUSD or deUSD takes on their equivalent amount of bad debt.

Fun thought experiment for the reader is how do you price the 6.2m deUSD 0x14 currently holds given its redemption price is dependent on xUSD's.

Now, I have no idea when or if these liquidations will actually occur. Given all the oracles are hardcoded, lenders only recourse is to wait till the interest accrual liquidates them. 

Places like Elixir's Morpho market on Plume this is likely to happen soon given Morpho's adaptive IR curve the borrow rate is already 190%.

On Euler, especially Plasma, it could take months given the hardcoded caps on the IR curves.

While I would expect the redemption process to take weeks to months, it is also possible they keep these positions alive long enough to just serve withdraws to circulating shares and therefore all lenders to xUSD will take a 100% loss in order to reduce the losses for current xUSD holders.

This exact reason is why, regardless of their shitcoin trading practices, what they were doing with collateralizing the self looped shares was extra levels of retardio even for this industry.

And as always is another friendly reminder that leverage is a fickle bitch and magnifies in both directions.

_____________

While I will leave most of the pontificating about the long term effects to DeFi to the clearly ever so alert CT crowd, obviously we have some issues.

At Yearn we have been speaking about this for quite some time, but seams the rest of DeFi has now woken up.

While any new meta such as Curation or Vaults, will have people pile in and there are bound to be bad actors or those that cut corners.

This clearly goes far beyond that. Almost every major ""risk manager"" showed themselves to be baphoon's in some capacity far beyond just those that directly allocated to Stream assets. Due diligence is the primary slower of growth and therefore gets thrown out first.

Users see vaults labeled as Prime, Core, Horizon, High Yield, etc all with a Curator name that means nothing to them and just end up chasing yields inevitably pushing the industry up the risk curve.

We need standardization, we need proper transparency and due diligence, and we need to understand when you treat financial markets like a high growth SAAS tech play, things like this are bound to happen.

A risk managers job is to say NO. If you are not doing that, or just waiting till shit goes sideways to try and pull your funds faster than others. Your not a risk manager you're a clown.

Hopefully as the system absorbs nine figures of bad debt it makes those leading the charge think a bit harder before they list the next shiny new shitcoin.

Outside of improvements to curation my top personal hope is this makes all vault providers currently using the black box method of off chain pricing their shares to change course.

This is one of the most terrifying widespread adoptions of this cycle, in which multisig's are arbitrarily setting the PPS of their vaults based on undisclosed off chain pricing logic.

And to be clear Stream is not the exception here, this is now standard practice from almost every vault provider, including basically all of the largest players. If you are in a blah, blah USD or ""Vault yada yada"", ""YieldCoin Whats its Nuts"" or whatever, you are almost certainly subject this.

As the industry continuous to move to a less cypher punk value set, we should make sure there is a distinction between decentralization and transparency. Even in places where we move to more centralized/trusted systems, transparency should still exist in its full force. Otherwise we really are just banking but worse.

While events like this always remind me why I am embarrassed to tell people I work in crypto, so far there does seem to be a positive response and recognizing our shortfalls.

Though I am sure next cycle a new group of kids will come along claiming they've got the best risk adjusted yields around and we will run it back once again.

Our only hope is each time this happens a few more people learn to demand more out of those they trust their money to.",2025-11-04T21:57:00.000Z,58,101,751,0,,neutral,1

The U.S. needs buyers for short-term debt. Tether steps in, scoops up the bonds, collects the interest and uses that yield to buy Bitcoin.

So the U.S. is issuing more debt to stay afloat, paying interest to Tether, and that interest is funding Bitcoin  its biggest monetary competitor. It_ like watching the system pay to build its own replacement.

The Polymarket origin story is funny because it's a rare case of the dream being identical to how things played out. If I learned one thing, it_ that bold ideas are everywhere, hidden in plain sight. It just takes someone crazy enough to spend their life willing it into existence. That_ entrepreneurship: willing things into existence.

I remember reading Robin Hanson_ literature on prediction markets and thinking - man, this is too good of an idea to just exist in whitepapers. There were a million reasons why it shouldn_ work, countless arguments of why not to do it, and the odds were against us, but we had to try. 

At the onset of the pandemic, I quite literally had nothing to lose: 21, running out of money, 2.5 years since I dropped out and nothing to show for it. But I knew we were entering an era where ways to find truth would matter more than ever, and Polymarket could play a critical role in that. After all, nothing is more valuable than the truth. It_ still a work in progress, but we_e honored to have made the impact we have thus far.

I_ also like to give a special thank you to all of our users, builders, and community members who have been with us since 2020. Your support will not be forgotten _

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful for all of the support and hard work of my brilliant team. I_ getting to live my wildest dreams, seemingly against all odds, and I don_ take it for granted. 

The best is yet to come __

It will become the first L1 to rely on a committee of proposers to deliver unmatched inclusion guarantees, making it the most reliable and credibly neutral place to transact onchain.

With real-time zkVMs, the protocol can safely start scaling towards gigagas per second, letting sophisticated prover-builders go beast mode while keeping them in check and making it extremely difficult to arbitrarily censor public transactions.

FOCIL also gives the protocol a clean foundation for the future of nodes, where validators can chose to specialize as includers, attesters, and execution proposers. This clean separation of roles protects consensus participants from MEV-related risks, and unlocks crucial issuance-curve changes . 

Institutions can trust that competitors can_ quietly bribe or pressure a handful of service providers to stop their transactions from landing onchain.

For RWAs and global payments, FOCIL provides the reliability these systems depend on. Stablecoin issuers, tokenized assets, and remittance networks gain predictable inclusion across geographies and market conditions.

L2s can shorten their withdrawal windows, offering smoother UX and stronger interoperability. That means faster exits, cheaper bridging, and lower costs for cross-chain swaps.

At the same time, L2s can improve their forced-transaction mechanisms and minimize differences with L1 clients, reducing code complexity and maintenance.

Everyday users buying ETH with stablecoins get the same protocol-level inclusion guarantees as large funds rebalancing their portfolios.

Borrowers on Aave can rely on Ethereum to include their transactions when it matters most, without fearing someone can block them from topping up collateral to avoid liquidation.

No one can slow down your crypto payment at a local café, your donation to a cause you deeply care about, or your vote on how your favorite DAO spends its treasury because of who you are or where you live.

Everyone shares equal, protocol-level access to Ethereum blockspace.

FOCIL lets Ethereum return to its core strength: credible neutrality secured by protocol rules, not trust.

Coordination and Innovation.

Coordination brings N people together to do more than the sum of the parts. Example: money, constitution, free markets, venture capital.

Innovation is the alchemy that converts a non resource into a resource. 
Example: convert air to spectrum, oil to energy, and silicon to intelligence. 

Both require risk taking: trying new things and failing often. But when they do succeed they have outsized returns. They create much more than they take, and thus grow the pie. 

To accelerate civilization we need to accelerate innovation and coordination. 

Technology automatically accelerates innovation, with AGI being the pinnacle of digital innovation.

Coordination is stuck in centuries old tech: money, constitution, and the Delaware C corp. Crypto is the new and ultimate accelerant of coordination: a system that is self-enforcing, automated, programmable and global.

This morning at the @strobefund  Summit, @Raph_Bloch and I joined a panel featuring @PhilGPotter (@Tether_to cofounder) and @KashRazzaghi (@circle): a discussion that, as @AriDavidPaul said, brought together 95% of the stablecoin market cap on one stage.

Here are the main takeaways _

1�__ Money is going on-chain, and fast.
Kash expects a 1 million-fold increase in transactions as stablecoins mature. Cross-border transfers will be instant and almost free. Every form of money movement will eventually live on-chain.
Yet both he and Phil agree: usability remains the biggest barrier. Seamless UX is what unlocks the next wave.

2�__ Oversight will be crucial.
Phil warned that trillions of dollars moving globally, instantly, could trigger systemic or even geopolitical shocks. Scale needs governance, and speed needs control.

3�__ A winner-takes-most dynamic.
Both see little room for newcomers. Unless you_e part of a ""powerhouse consortium"", it_ nearly impossible to reach critical mass. Kash added: ""we believe it_l be a one winner takes most of the market"".

4�__ Tokenized deposits  stablecoins.
Kash emphasized that banks will probably go big on tokenized deposits, a theme we_e been exploring at @TheBigWhale_ with our clients, especially in our Q3 2025 briefing ""The Institutional Dynamics of Stablecoins"".

It_ clear the next phase of crypto will be shaped by how traditional finance integrates (not imitates) these new forms of money.",2025-11-13T17:41:00.000Z,3,4,13,0,,neutral,0.6

During a panel with @_pgauthier (@Ledger) and @tyhunnny (@TYBXYZ) hosted by @fintechfrank, Pascal put it simply:

_ ""Stop thinking tech first. Think product first. Tech should serve the user"". Couldn_ agree more at @TheBigWhale_ 

Still, any compromise between ownership and UX must be weighed carefully: ""It_ a critical moment in humanity to not let technology enslave us"".

Lending only works when people believe the markets are sound, that collateral is solid, risk parameters make sense, and the system as a whole is stable. Once that trust breaks, you get the onchain version of a bank run.

That_ why a model where anyone can spin up a vault permissionlessly and market it on the same platform has built-in weaknesses. Since most strategies are already commoditized, curators don_ have many ways to stand out. They either lower fees to the bone or take on more and more risk to attract capital from other pools.

Curators are meant to manage distinct strategies and segregate risk, yet in practice, they all end up supplying liquidity to the same underlying lending markets. What is designed to promote diversification instead concentrates exposure, turning one curator_ stress into everyone_ problem.

Despite being framed as modular and independent, the model inherently links all vaults through shared borrower pools. Liquidity from multiple curators merges into a single system, so the decisions or withdrawals of one can ripple instantly across all others as we see with recent issues with xUSD and similar assets. Even a cautious curator cannot escape the fallout from a more aggressive participant operating within the same pool.

When confidence falters or withdrawals accelerate, these shared markets seize up. Utilization shoots to 100%, redemptions grind to a halt, and borrowing rates spike to unsustainable levels. A localized liquidity crunch quickly transforms into a protocol-wide freeze, a DeFi version of a bank run essentially.

This creates a design paradox: a system built for isolation that, in reality, amplifies interdependence. Every vault inherits the risk behavior of the weakest curator, making the entire structure vulnerable when liquidity is most needed.

This model is even amplified by the economic design of these protocols: lower fees or take more risk to create business, otherwise become commoditized.

In contrast, Aave_ architecture achieves the risk segregation that curator models only promise. Each market operates in true isolation, with conservative collateral standards, controlled listings, and transparent onchain governance. Market shocks remain contained, liquidity remains accessible, and the protocol_ record of zero bad debt across billions in total value supplied underscores its resilience.

For vault creators and users, this difference is decisive. Shared-liquidity designs magnify contagion, while isolated-market frameworks contain it. Aave_ conservative design ensures predictable yields, reliable redemptions, and the stability that sustains confidence through volatility.

https://x.com/StaniKulechov/status/1987253693138514006,@StaniKulechov,https://x.com/StaniKulechov,"Some misconceptions and paradoxes in DeFi lending:

Lending is based on trust. This is the self-evident truth on which banking is built. Losing trust means losing capital, and that can cause bank runs or systemic collapses.

The way to preserve trust is to create a system that is fundamentally risk-averse throughout the entire supply chain. Ignore this rule and you are effectively in the business of risk-taking, which is more akin to today_ hedge funds.

DeFi lending protocols follow the same basic principles as banking. The fundamental difference between traditional finance and DeFi lending systems is that lending protocols encode trust mechanisms into the code for reasons like improving automation, capital efficiency, and liquidity provisioning etc.

Some people have a flawed idea that if a lending protocol fixes parameters around trust, it will somehow improve trust. Of course, this does not make sense since you are simply moving trust from one place to another. From one market level to another, but not really improving the trust assumptions, at all in fact.

You also cannot rely on fully immutable systems in dynamic marketplaces such as lending and borrowing. This is why comparing lending protocols to AMMs does not work either. Traders on AMMs do not depend on ongoing trust; their transactions are one-off trades, while borrowers and lenders maintain a relationship until the debt is repaid.
 
Applying immutable parameters means the system cannot adapt to changing market conditions, and financial markets are nothing if not dynamic. It_ relatively straightforward to run immutable model during up cycle, however bear markets is where the true resiliency is tested out.

Now, back to the idea of moving trust from one place to another.
 
Since trust always exists in lending, and most markets will likely rely on some level of human involvement, the real question is: at what level and under what circumstances should that involvement occur?

In isolated lending protocols like Aave, decision-making happens at the lowest level, close to the markets. This has benefits, such as ensuring that parameter decisions remain aligned with the protocol_ risk framework in a non-conflicted way. Risk managers are paid fixed fees to protect the protocol. If they fail, they get replaced, as we have seen before.

In designs where human involvement is moved higher up and risk curators are incentivized based on fund performance, hidden issues can emerge that are highly detrimental to the system.
 
First, the idea of risk curation as isolation is misleading. While markets may be separated, risk curators often share liquidity across markets by supplying to the same markets and comingling strategies. This means users can be exposed to the weakest curator or market in the system, with no capped protection.

For example:
 
Curator A supplies liquidity to markets B and C, while curator D supplies liquidity to markets C and E. If market E loses trust, for instance through a depeg event like xUSD or deUSD, it could trigger a bank run from market E, driving utilization to 100% and creating a race for withdrawals and even full insolvency.
 
At the same time, LPs withdrawing from the curated vaults cause another bank run at the vault level, meaning markets B and C are affected too. As a result, curator A_ LPs, even those subscribed to less risky strategies, would also be impacted, intensifying the liquidity contagion, even if they didn_ supply the liquidity into the problematic market, creating protocl-wide bank run.

This is my biggest concern with this type of design model: it leads to contagious liquidity effects that break trust while marketing some sort of risk isolation, which doesn_ in reality exist. It is especially problematic for RWAs, which require greater isolation due to their specific characteristics.

The problem worsens when considering curator incentives. DeFi risk strategies are highly commoditized. Lending against ETH or BTC is not particularly profitable or exciting for degens. So curators often go on the offensive, adding new types of collateral, sometimes untested or poorly understood. Other curators then rush to copy and allocate capital to these new markets.
 
It becomes a speed race to capture reward at the cost of additional risk, much like hedge funds today operate. It_ especially problematic for integrators that are looking to run their own strategies, knowing they would be commingled with strategies ran by riskier vault curators, making integrations more challenging.
 
Also this design comes at the cost of liquidity segregation, without truly improving or isolating risk, while introducing potential systemic contagion on every bank run. Given the permissionless nature, we will see more events of contagions spread.
 
It_ important for everyone to understand the mechanisms. DeFi is still relatively young, less than a decade old, and any large-scale issue could set the industry back significantly.
 
We are close to building safe and secure DeFi, and we need to protect the users. Hope this is a good learning on how to build better DeFi.

The user decision to supply liquidity into Aave happens directly on the market level when the while on curated vault models it happens when a user is deciding to use a curator vault. This is where _arkets actually happen (curator model doesn_ offer anything new without both vaults + markets combined). In terms of Aave, user supplying liquidity to one market, liquidity would not be shared with another market. This leads to isolation whereas with curation vaults, supplying to one vault that supplies across multiple markets, means there is lack of isolation here (and exposure to other curators strategies). Again it_ another approach and but introduces some complexities that I pointed out in the post.
 
Regarding your point about oracles and re-applying a pricing strategy is an important point, what I am concerned is when there is a need to improve an oracle system. Let say when an oracle provider decides to upgrade their system, immutable oracle configs would stop producing prices. This is a tail end risk that most likely will materialize and there is no defense in immutable system. Surely could argue that borrowers would need to repay their loans but this will screw up the borrower even more.
 
While I do agree that there is competitive pressure everywhere, its quite different compared to a setup where all curators compete - against each other - while in Aave they service providers compete to win together. This is an example conflict that is not present in Aave. Also in Aave cutting corners is harder to do, each service provider observes each other_ work, points issues and even can produces alternative ideas. We_e seen this with risk managers, dev teams and also in growth teams. It_ a symbiosis that keeps the system in check. While in vault curator model there is no vetting process and typically risk management is centralized to a curator for good or bad.
 
I don_ agree on the tying to the worst collateral ties the protocol to the same risk. First of all users in Aave can supply assets to different markets and they have different collateral compositions and risk parameters, while in curation vaults model the liquidity is shared. Second, collaterals are limited with supply caps or even isolation mode where needed, so the markets can take limited exposure where it works, by pre-vetted risk management process, where each stakeholder are incentivized to ensure the market is not moving outside of the acceptable risk perimeter. This type of model builds trust and given the pre-vetting framework is more resilient compare to delegating the whole authority to a single entity, like a curator.

https://x.com/StaniKulechov/status/1989313384420938060,@StaniKulechov,https://x.com/StaniKulechov,"My concerns around the Uniswap Labs proposal:

While I appreciate Hayden_ and Uniswap Labs commitment to refocusing attention on the Uniswap protocol, and while that may be the right direction for them, I find that the proposal does not lead to the best outcome when applied more broadly across DeFi and other DAOs.

When a DAO has a genuine need for decentralized decision making, and this is typically the case for protocols with active parameters that must adjust to changing market conditions, such as lending protocols like Aave, decentralized governance becomes essential for protocol resiliency.

Resiliency is the key reason why many users and integrators trust Aave, and why Aave has become one of the most trusted DeFi protocols. The DAO has a pre-vetted, multi-stakeholder process that ensures no junk assets are listed and that the protocol does not take on more risk than it should. This approach has been proven across multiple market cycles, from the FTX crash and Terra Luna to several bear markets, the recent Black Friday, and last week_ events in DeFi.

Decentralized decision making can work very well when stakeholders have sufficient skin in the game and distinct expertise, allowing them to validate proposals and keep one another in check.

Second, true resiliency also means that if any stakeholder is removed from the equation, the protocol should still survive, continue growing, and create opportunities for new stakeholders to enter.

If there is a real need for resiliency, decentralized decision making works only when there are enough independent stakeholders. Without independent stakeholders, there is no real decentralization and no resiliency. Instead, decision making becomes concentrated, creating single points of failure.

To establish independence, each stakeholder should operate as its own business, with its own vision, mission, and balance sheet. Alignment can still be maintained by ensuring that all independent stakeholders have skin in the game.

The best way to ensure both independence and alignment or skin in the game is to build a business that either uses the protocol and helps scale its market share, or provides services to the protocol. This works because it creates the most capitalistic and incentive aligned scenario within a DAO. I am more bullish on the first path than the second, mainly because it is difficult to scale a business that relies on a single DAO. A service provider would typically need to support multiple similar protocols, which can introduce conflicts of interest.

I believe that if a DAO relies on one core entity, the outcome is far less efficient. The entity gains too much influence over the protocol, which reduces competition among service providers and results in higher costs for the DAO. If service providers and labs teams do not focus on building businesses on top of the protocol, the DAO becomes reliant on third parties with weaker alignment. This can lead to the underlying protocol becoming commoditized. If the protocol is fully abstracted away by the application layer, a third party has little reason to care about alignment when it can simply support multiple similar products and choose the lowest cost option. In contrast, having multiple stakeholders building successful businesses on top of a protocol, with real skin in the game, creates far stronger alignment.

Some may argue that a labs entity could simply build these services for the DAO. However, in that case, it becomes difficult for such an entity to compete with businesses operating in truly competitive capitalistic markets. This approach would likely result in mediocre products that are outcompeted by centralized teams with fewer governance constraints. It risks turning the labs entity into a grant driven organization with governance overhead, making it a less competitive acquisition layer for the protocol. In contrast, a model where aligned service providers build businesses powered by the protocol leads to higher market share, more competitive products, higher fees for the protocol, and more value for tokenholders. Protocols are meant to power businesses and products and to pursue the highest possible market share, and the best way to achieve that is through a fully competitive and capitalistic approach.

Another important point is why the DAO would corner itself into relying on a single core entity when it could instead place diversified and aligned bets with multiple teams. Also, why should the DAO sponsor the acquisition layer and take on venture risk to do so? This role should belong to service providers or entities building businesses on top of the protocol, using their and using their own balance sheet. The DAO and protocol should remain focused primarily on protocol development and fee management to ensure the highest outcome for tokenholders.",2025-11-14T12:44:00.000Z,52,28,370,0,,neutral,0.6

https://x.com/tarunchitra/status/1963242037454520676,@tarunchitra,https://x.com/tarunchitra,"One main difference here (and this is from an app UX standpoint), is that if you have a yield-bearing vault that, even when tokenized, is not particularly liquid (e.g. due to withdrawal requirements or non-atomic deposit/withdrawal semantics), then you can't ""deposit"" it directly in the way you do with stETH. 

Think about the early days of DeFi, where people would have WETH on mainnet and WETH on an L2 and the liquidity differences led to huge mispricings when liquidations occurred; for these less liquid vaults (which are become far more popular now), you need to prove more properties of the assets locked in escrow (e.g. bounds on portfolio NAV) than you do for a receipt token that is liquid

So if you zoom out, ""it looks like an L2's mutex-like locking;"" but if you look at the practicality of using ""remote"" assets as collateral when they aren't super liquid when tokenized but provide non-atomic withdrawals, then there are a number of nuances",2025-09-03T14:05:00.000Z,2,0,8,0,,neutral,0

You lost money on oct 10 and instead of understanding your failings so you can improve and not repeat history, you blame Binance and now Zach. That_ it.

Like I_ sorry you got rekt by the market but that doesn_ make it market manipulation.

People were over levered and had no risk controls. So market moves down a hair and ppl get liquidated. Thats literally how the market works. By design.

Every one of those positions must be market sold AND BOUGHT. But price is dropping fast, who is buying that?  Especially when every MM with any risk controls paused and pulled out bc that_ how you control risk.

Then your stop losses trigger but there_ not enough buyers for those either. Meanwhile price is still dropping, triggering more liquidations, which creates more market sells, which drives the price down further.

As far as I know, every single case where users were provided a guarantee, which are very select cases, Binance reimbursed to uphold those guarantees. Binance does not guarantee that the market will go up forever. I_ sorry.

Binance_ biggest fault is having so many immature retail users on platform, none of whom have any idea how to mitigate risk (case in point: you)

If you take issue with that, that_ fine. Make a tweet thread blaming Binance for that. But be careful what you wish for bc that_ why tradfi doesn_ let anyone trade derivatives without proof of wealth and _ntelligence.

First step is to define and measure the things.

- bounded

- remediated (fast, transparently, fairly)
- not contagious!!!

How do you measure that shit? Yeah I dunno. Good luck man.

- Max single-incident loss amts
- Exposure / counterparties / dependency limits (if a single token going under = 100% TVL loss = you_e fucked)
- Time to detect / contain (automated)
- Time to detect / contain (manual, SLO_)
- Effectiveness of containment (if the token goes bye bye but you_e already fucked then containment doesn_ matter)
- Some measure of blast radius
- Total unmitigated worst case contagion loss amts 
- Ring-fenced asset amt for immediate remediation of losses (can go towards limiting contagion too)
- Some measure of risk acceptance (we accept the risk of giving all our money to a kid and have no way to detect or contain losses there)",2025-11-11T19:42:00.000Z,1,0,19,0,,neutral,-1

Over time people will level up.

Sure, if you decrease the size and users of a thing by 99% then sure, it tracks that 99% of the exploits would decrease alongside.

Proportionally, the attacks would increase relative to TVL / distinct users though. So the risk to the protocol and each user of the protocol would increase. Not decrease.

1. The incentive to fork by any entity in a particular position of power or control or advantage is extremely high. Historically this is almost entirely CEX_ as they control the creation and distribution of new markets. Today it_ more complex.

2. It_ doesn_ actually create 2 new economies, it splits value across 2 economies in an unpredictable and chaotic way. In doing so, neither economy is as valuable as the sum of its parts, and some amt of value also peaces out completely. Ultimately everyone loses. However, if you can come out ahead of in value redistribution, you will still do it. Incentives.

3. If the risk or perception of a fork occurring becomes too high, faith in the underlying protocol and assets diminishes. Liquidity dries up, less value is created as overall risk increases which impacts risk tolerance which impacts capital flows, value is destroyed when capital moves out of the ecosystem bc markets become weaker and more inefficient which introduces more risk and on and on.

Stablecoins absolutely control the fork choice. However, they aren_ necessarily incentivized to cause a fork or potential fork. I would say the likelihood of a fork happening on BTC is greater than ETH and SOL and that_ solely due to where the stablecoins live.

Their incentives could change though, most likely in reaction to an external event or change of circumstances that creates risk for the stablecoins. If at that point they deem it to be less risky to push for a fork that stay neutral, they will do so, because they control the fork choice which means they can derisk their own losses that would come from a fork, and they will do so even if it_ at the expense of others and the value of the ecosystem.",2025-11-13T19:43:00.000Z,6,3,16,1,BTC,neutral,0.2

These words have well understood definitions within the theoretical research community. But those folks have less understanding of the broader market and value creation on the whole.

Meanwhile the broader market and those creating new value by taking on risk loads of risk have no fucking clue what those words mean they just think they are inherently valuable. (Spoiler: they aren_)

Thus the conversation and motivations and understanding of priorities get mucked up. Disagreements happen. Respect and trust erodes. Etc.

Solana is better than Ethereum at avoiding this sort of muck. But only bc it doesn_ much have a theoretical research community. Worth noting that less muck does NOT necessarily ensure better outcomes. It just means it_ easier to arrive at any outcome.

Anyways.

Alignment means that entity 1_ incentives match entity 2_. This is only valuable to consider bc it decreases the risk for entity 2. It also makes theoretical risks easier to define, understand, and thus mitigate (theoretically)

e.g. If a stablecoin is incentivized to malign Ethereum for its own gain, even if that gain adversely impacts the value of Ethereum, it should be expected that it does so.

Assuming Ethereum_ goal is to not be maligned and not have its value adversely impacted, it should obviously prioritize mitigating that risk.

How it ultimately prioritizes mitigating such things depends entirely on 2 things and none are the actuality of the risk (lol) 
1. It depends on the people who do thing_ perception of the risk relative to all their other perceptions about all the other risks 
2. It depends on their perception of their own ability to mitigate it and their perception of the effectiveness of their mitigations relative to their perceived effectiveness of other mitigations of other perceived risks.

Ameen thinks it_ stupid to prioritize FOCIL as it_ not actually effective at mitigating the risk of a fork bc that decision is ultimately on the stablecoins. He_ not wrong.

Researchers think it_ important to prioritize FOCIL because it impacts the overall power structures of various parties which could impact viability of a fork being induced (I think) but also other censorship things. Most likely the priority comes from the reality the researchers don_ have any clue how to incentivize the stablecoins to choose the right fork bc they have no way to define _ight and don_ perceive themselves to have influence over the application layer. They_e (probably) not wrong on some of that and unable to know they are super wrong on the rest unless you wish to upend their entire view of reality in a way that would eliminate their value as theoretical researchers on the whole (which I think is probably a bad plan bc research and especially irrational theoretical research has a lot of value even if it creates some muck.)",2025-11-13T20:17:00.000Z,0,0,0,0,,neutral,1

_ Altyapı tarafında proje, Avalanche üzerinde kendi Layer-1 a_ını in_a ediyor. Bu sayede kurumsal i_letmeler için gizlilik, izinli yapı ve EVM uyumlulu_u gibi özelliklerle ölçeklenebilir bir ortam sunmayı hedefliyor.

_ Hedefleri; Gerçek ekonomiyi zincir üstüne ta_ımak.

Yani geleneksel ekonomide faaliyet gösteren _irketler ile çalı_ıp, bu i_letmeleri blokzincir altyapısı üzerinde yeniden yapılandırmayı hedefliyor.

Yani odak noktası gerçek _irketleri zincir tabanlı bir modele dönü_türmek.

��_ Ve Inversion, Dragonfly liderli_inde seed turunda
VanEck, ParaFi Capital, Wintermute Ventures ve HashKey Capital gibi sektörün önde gelen fonlarından 26,5 milyon dolar yatırım aldı.

_he modern progressive movement is clearly not progressive.

_rogressive is defined by the working class do better tomorrow than they did today and know it.

_o do that, you need things that you can do at scale now. Vocational training on AI-based systems, making our laborers more valuable. Obviously closing the border so that you don't reduce the amount that you pay people, and also eviscerate legal protections. This is not progressive.

_t's not progressive, by the way, to have so little competence or willing to use force that we get overrun by drugs.

_ho do those drugs go to? Disproportionately poor people of color.

_t's not progressive to have crime rates you know, to be a war zone, you have to have five deaths per 100,000. That's like half our cities. How is that progressive?

_ don't think China is a rising power. I think China is a re-ascending power.

_nd the reason I say that is, if you go back to 1500 to now, over all of those years, China had the world's largest GDP 70% of those years.

_f you think about it in that context, especially as a Confucian society, I think the Chinese think about this as, _old on, this is reasserting the dominance that we've always had._

_he other interesting thing, which I learned studying China, is how they allocate capital.

_he capital allocation system is both rigid, but it's incredibly flexible. What do I mean?

_ou have Xi Jinping and his close circle of people, they dictate the priorities, right?

_i is personally right now helping to draft the five year business plan of China.

_ut what happens is, it goes from that central group of like 7, 8, 9 people, to the Politburo, and when it gets approved by the Politburo, it gets sent to all the provinces and then it gets sent to the prefectures.

_o an example was in 2006 and 2007 when they decided to prioritize EVs.

_hat you effectively have is a cascading set of venture capitalists who are operating against a national priority and then they are rewarded for it.

_nd so you essentially have 300 VCs running around organizing human capital in all of these different provinces against all of these different priorities.

_nd at the end of that you get a BYD, or you get a Xiaomi, or you get these great companies.

Friedberg:

_ think gambling generally, as we call it, should be decriminalized.

_nd I don't like this state-by-state set up with gambling.

_ think we should have a federal regulatory body.

_his is not going away. People love to bet on stuff. This is part of sports, this is part of the culture.

Chamath:

__ook at Polymarket.

_olymarket raised at, whatever it was, $1-2B at $9B. Then the next weekend they announced sports betting and now they're raising money 30 days later at, allegedly, $12-15B.

_nd you can see, by the way, the way that DraftKings and FanDuel stock have reacted to this, those companies are toast.

Friedberg:

__he Polymarket model is the best model because it creates a market.

_nd so as information flows in, that market will dynamically adjust and everyone will get a more fair price.

_olymarket actually has the news before the news does.

_nd this is one of the most powerful outputs of Polymarket, is they're actually getting a read on what's going on in the world before the media recognizes it, before the public recognizes it.

- contribute all cash to a closed ICO raise
- distribute ICO ownership tokens to Pump tokenholders pro rata
- link up revenue to a treasury controlled by Futarchy

I believe this would trade at a higher valuation than Pump_ existing token on day one.

Right now Pump trades at a discount because outsiders like me don_ know exactly what is going on with the cash raised / how much of the revenue will go to buybacks vs equity going forward. 

You may believe this is not an issue at all (and you may be completely right! The point is that I don_ know) but I promise the market is haircutting valuation based on these concerns. Why not send those concerns to 0.00 with haste.

https://x.com/trevor_flipper/status/1977480878260428912,@trevor_flipper,https://x.com/Arthur_0x,"Oct 10 Crypto Massacre: Binance Edition

The most important microstructure fact from the October 10th crypto massacre isn_ just _olatility was high and we had chain congestion, it_ that the reference/pricing/quotes many desks and DEXs lean on became unreliable, exactly when everyone needed it most. 

As it stands today, I am cautious to make acquisitions on what the root cause was. It is easy to point fingers at Binance right now but I don_ think that is justifiable, yet. The timing of depegs and initial cascade is still being looked into.

This is subject to change with more info. 

However, for us onchain users, the main issue was that Binance prices their wrapped assets at spot market price and not underlying value price. This is a known flaw that many borrow/lend protocols have identified, such as Solend and Aave, and is the reason many loopers were largely okay. 

Using secondary market pricing as an oracle for a token backed by real dollars (or SOL with an LST) makes no sense -> given the market price != the real price.

Crypto has too many venues, so why should the Binance market for USDe be the bearer of truth when in reality USDe is always backed by real value. The mint/redeem price should be the bearer of truth not Binance. 

Binance_ unified-margin stack was marking key collateral (USDe, BNSOL, wBETH) off its own spot order books. In the dislocation, those local markets detached from underlying value, WBETH printed in the $400s at one point while ETH itself traded multiples higher, and USDE/BNSOL also plunged on Binance versus external venues. Quoting for USDE was terrible and essentially caused anyone who was long an asset with usde as the collateral to get liquidated.

Okay, so if Binance was a big contributor to the mass liquidations onchain, how did Binance cause me to get liquidated on other perp DEXs?

Because in crypto perps, fair value is synthesized from a small set of anchors, and Binance is still the heaviest anchor. Most perps, CEXs and DEXs, blend top-venue spot feeds and many DEX oracles ultimately reference those same feeds. 

When the largest venue_ API stalls, Binance, and its local spot marks misprice wrapped collateral, two things happen in the market maker (MM) stack: (1) inventory and margin models start screaming false signals (your collateral is supposedly worth 4080% less when it is not), and (2) the external _id used to place quotes, skew sizes, and choose venues no longer feels trustworthy. 

With no defensible mid, MMs do the only rational thing: pull size, push their quotes way back, or go dark entirely until they can recompute risk. 

This is why some perp DEXs, those that held up better than others, still couldn_ fill some users bids. There were no market makers willing to quote. That gap shows up to end users as _preads went crazy and _an_ get filled, even on DEXs that did remain online. It_ not that no one wanted to make markets; it_ that you can_ price what you can_ mark. 

In a unified-margin regime, collateral marks flow straight into the math for liquidation thresholds. If WBETH is valued off a thin, dislocated spot print rather than its redeemable ETH value, your cross-portfolio buffer can vanish in seconds, even if your directional book is fine. 

This is why many basis (delta neutral) traders still got wrecked, especially those with high leverage as they quickly learned about ADL.Forced liquidations then hit books already thin on the bid, pushing prints further from fair and propagating the error into everyone else_ _ndex via cross-venue references, which sounds good in theory, but as explained above, is flawed when the leader goes bust. 

From a market maker_ (MM) point of view, the decision tree was brutal but quite an easy decision. Try to make a market but risk going bust or pull liquidity?

When your collateral present value (PV) and cross-venue mid diverge from reality, value at risk (VaR) explodes and your kill-switches trip. 

This compounded with API/chain congestion, wallet throttles, and venue halts. MMs often couldn_ move collateral or lay off basis even if they noted the mispricing and wanted to get out. This is why some MMs fared better than others. 

Lastly on MMs, contrary to CT, market making in that type of environment is massively -ev for these market makers. That_ why many desks yanked liquidity late, widening spreads further, and lived to re-enter once feeds normalized and collateral marks were patched. 

On venue performance: it_ fair to note @HyperliquidX  remained up (users are still hot about ADL), @Lighter_xyz  was down for ~4.5 hours, @tradeparadex was down for ~1 hour, and several centralized venues had intermittent issues amid the cascade. 

But uptime really isn_ the primary point here. It is reference/pricing/quote integrity and microstructure flaws on Binance_ side and other venues over-indexing on Binance_ prices. How is a team, Binance, that has been in the industry for 8 years still mispricing assets?

They price their wrapped assets at spot market price and not underlying value price. Marking them to thin spot prints instead of underlying redemption value is a first-principles error. 

If the system_ _rice of record is wrong, the rational market-maker response is to just pull all liquidity, which is smart for them, and even the best-engineered matching engine can_ conjure fills out of risk-model uncertainty. 

Zooming out: could a big Binance-focused MM have gone belly-up? I think so. The combination of (a) collateral PV shock from mis-marked wrapped assets, (b) inability to mobilize margin, and (c) stale/broken APIs is exactly the recipe that flips well-behaved delta books into forced-liquidation machines. 

We_l know more when desks publish their post-mortems; for now, my opinion is that this largely stems from Binance.

Last, on near-term flow and the macro overlay: Monday and Tuesday pose serious mark-to-market risk for traditional funds, as dealers who manage margin will need to crystallize losses. A surprise détente headline can always rip risk higher and, perversely, with a large cohort of six- to eight-figure crypto traders now structurally sidelined, the pain trade may indeed be up. 

However, I also see the other side: _ey, the market puked; I_ piling all my cash in for the meteoric rise and a resumption of _p-only season,_ only to watch the wick get filled in the direction no one wants to see.

Either way, I think in order to step into the market with bids in a meaningful way you need to assume Trump and Xi laugh it off and shake hands, which who knows, might already be happening.",2025-10-12T21:05:00.000Z,34,50,319,1,ETH,neutral,0.6

---

1. Latency is always a race to zero

Traditional HFT operates in the nano- and microsecond realm. No current blockchain  not even @megaeth_labs (10ms) or admittedly @bulletxyz_ (3ms)  comes close. The idea that an execution layer can fully eliminate _tate delta through FIFO processing assumes an ideal that doesn_ exist in real markets.

> _f the execution layer is performant enough to process everything FIFO then prioritizing cancels no longer makes sense.
This isn_ quite right.

The race isn_ between order placement and execution, but between the MM_ cancel and the taker_ fill  and even a few ms head start makes all the difference. In TradFi, HFTs purposely obscure their true latency to retain a _eserve edge when caught. Latency asymmetry is the game.

---

2. Fairness vs Liquidity Bootstrapping

DeFi isn_ TradFi. The biggest challenge today isn't fairness  it_ liquidity. TradFi exchanges are mature, with deep books and robust price discovery. DeFi isn_ there yet.

That said, it's false to argue _asdaq doesn_ have speed bumps, so toxic HFT must not be an issue. In fact, smaller TradFi venues like IEX and CHX introduced speed bumps precisely to combat these dynamics.

The HFT arms race is real in traditional financial markets:
* HFT flow accounts for ~20% of volume 
* Raises liquidity costs by 17%
* Makers win the cancel race just 13% of the time [1]

---

My take? We can and should have both.

DEXs must attract deep liquidity to compete with CEXs. That requires protecting MMs from toxic flow while enabling efficient execution. We_e already seen success here  Hyperliquid users accept its reordering logic, because it enables tighter spreads and better fills via MM _ast look advantages.

That_ why @bulletxyz_ is designed to do both:

* Low-latency (ms-level) execution
* App-specific sequencing

This is hard to do on general-purpose L1s  but necessary if we want DeFi to scale competitively.

That means committing wholeheartedly in the act of climbing. Which accordingly means sacrificing comfort, security, and the illusion of control at the altar of exposure, suffering, and the cold indifference of stone.

Codependence is not a pathology; it is the rope team.
It is not weakness but a form of transcendence.

Interreliance and relinquishment of self are more satisfying than any _ummit selfie or solo achievement.

Apotheosis of the self can only end in a vacuous narcissism held aloft on the capricious approval of strangers in the comments.

Embrace the void, the vertigo, and the possibility of failure.
In the death of ego, you will find a strange and ineffable joy

It_ the point at which government and corporate reach end and our individual freedoms and self-sovereignty begin. As our lives have moved online, privacy_ become a rare, vanishing commodity.

That_ why we founded Cypherpunk (@cypherpunktech)  a company dedicated to privacy and self-sovereignty. We will execute on our mission by accumulating, building, and supporting privacy-protecting assets and technologies at a time when the world needs them more than ever.

To that end, Cypherpunk  Ticker: $LPTX (today), $CYPH (tomorrow)  was launched with a $50 million+ investment from @winklevosscap to begin accumulating Zcash ($ZEC) at what we believe to be a significant discount to Zcash_ true long-term value. Cypherpunk currently holds 203,775 ZEC purchased at an average price of ~$245 per coin, representing ~1.25% of the current ZEC supply. We plan to continue accumulating ZEC rapidly so that Cypherpunk owns at least 5% of the total ZEC supply.

Since Zcash_ launch 9 years ago, we_e observed its highly symbiotic relationship with bitcoin. Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin and shares identical tokenomics  both have a fixed total supply of 21 million coins. If bitcoin is digital gold, Zcash is encrypted bitcoin, or digital cash. One is your store of value, the other is how you privately move your value. We_e been tracking this symbiosis for years and believe that now  as we enter the age of AI  is the right time to begin accumulating ZEC.

We feel strongly that Zcash could become a meaningful percentage of Bitcoin_ market capitalization  just on the merits of it being a privacy hedge or insurance policy to Bitcoin_ transparency alone. We believe bitcoin will continue to ascend to $1,000,000 per coin over the next 5-10 years. We also believe Zcash will appreciate significantly from here as well. These coins go hand in hand.

Over the next few weeks, we_l continue to lay out our thesis. In the meantime, we_e excited to have you join us as we stack zats and invest in other technologies that promote privacy and self-sovereignty. Let us proceed together apace.

It's not stablecoin issuers that are afraid, it's banks. They're the ones most vulnerable to consumers holding their own dollars while earning a fair yield on those dollars. Our highly leveraged financial system exists on the premise that consumers are locked into holding their funds at banks, on which banks pay close to zero interest, while making loans and other efforts to generate yield on those dollars for themselves. 

It's the exact same reason the federal government hasn't allowed narrow banking whereby a bank takes in deposits and just holds all funds at the federal reserve, without making any loans, thereby creating incredibly safe and stable banking for consumers. 

This isn't about consumer protection. It's about protecting entrenched interests and also preserving the ability of the federal reserve to monkey with interest rates and other risk parameters to control the economy.",2025-03-28T13:04:00.000Z,34,64,491,0,,neutral,0

The @NIH is the largest biomedical research funding body in the world  it_ a remarkable American asset, the source of so much therapeutic innovation, and I hope it continues to get even better in coming years.

This is not a political post. *Everyone* wants better health. 

I am an extremely grateful product of NIH funding - via the extraordinary MSTP (MD PhD) program, a steady fuel that has supported young biomedical research trainees for over 60 years in this country. I was, am, and continue to be a *huge* fan of what Director Francis Collins and many others achieved at the NIH. He oversaw our transition from the early days of human genetics to human genomics, to precision medicine (launching @AllofUsResearch), to extraordinary strides in cancer research, and much more.

And now we have a new NIH Director: Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. I took his undergrad health economics class at Stanford as a student nearly 20 yrs ago (!), and felt super fortunate to sit down with him this week to better understand how he thinks about go-forward priorities at NIH.

I found his vision compelling. He was transparent, direct, and clear. The NIH essentially has two big mandates: (1) fund allocation (deciding what major areas to fund, in what relative magnitudes), and (2) grant execution (selecting individual recipients, oversight of research over time, etc).

On (1), he wants to make sure the NIH is appropriately prioritizing ROI against the most common diseases in America: diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, COPD, kidney disease, Alzheimer_, cancer, etc. He also believes NIH should respond with research in areas where disease prevalence has recently changed for reasons we don_ fully understand (eg autism).

On (2), he wants to enable the NIH to take bold risks, fund science that might fail, and encourage more young investigators to enter academia and science  because the current environment concentrates research $ in the hands of a few established labs, and leaves bright new people scrambling to yet another post doc if all their science doesn_ _ork. Everyone who_ ever spent time in academia knows there_ truth in that reality, but perhaps we haven_ yet known how to propose solutions. (The birth of multiple philanthropically-funded institutes have been one response).

Director Bhattacharya cares about academic freedom. Please listen to the conversation  we discussed (and agreed upon) the importance of evidence-based vaccines. We had a spirited debate about whether Americans should be empowered to defer to experts (at HHS, CDC, FDA, etc) on topics about their healthcare versus exercise their own choice. We probably don_ have exactly the same opinion on this topic, but that_ OK because we were granted the opportunity to engage in a civil debate.

So, consider listening. Listen if you are optimistic about biomedical science in America, and listen *especially* if you_e had skepticism about its future. Bring an open mind, form your own views, look for opportunities to express your feedback, and continue to debate. In the meantime, I remain incredibly excited to see continued innovation here in the US, and meet the brilliant investigators that NIH will boldly fund.

Namely, I remember the book arguing that the success of large well-integrated corporations is proof that they're more efficient than having market relationships between different parts of the supply chain, and so we should just have government-run structures that have the same style but serve the public interest instead of shareholders.

Intuitively, if you take horizontal monopolies as given, then vertical integration does make things less bad, because at least you avoid the ""get permission from N of N different kings"" problem. (eg. the hardware space has a lot of this N-of-N-different-kings issue) The economic argument within that context has always seemed sound to me.

The solution is to not take horizontal monopolies as given.

(Or, if you are inclined the other way, take the People's Republic of Walmart route and do a full-stack democratically-controlled monopoly. Which of course our economies already do in some sectors, and it's worth noting that a major source of failures in the public sector the last couple of decades comes from it losing a lot of overhead to consulting firms, the farmed-out nonprofit sector, etc - so basically horizontal monopoly without vertical integration)",2025-11-08T00:54:00.000Z,12,5,33,0,,neutral,0

I think the argument in the essay hinges on an optimism about political systems that I don't share at all. The various human rights and economic development people I talk to and listen to tend have an opposite perspective: in the 2020s, relying on rich people's sympathy has hit a dead end, and if you want to be treated humanely, you have to build power - and the nicest form of power is being useful to people.

The right point of comparison is not people collecting welfare in rich countries like the USA, it's people in, like... Sudan, where a civil war is killing hundreds of thousands, and the global media generally just does not care one bit.

So I think if you take away the only leverage that humans naturally have - the ability to be useful to others through work - then the leverage that many people have to secure fair treatment for themselves and their communities will drop to literally zero.

Previous waves of automation did not have this problem, because there's always some other thing you can switch to working on. This time, no. And the square kilometers of land that all the people live on and get food from will be wanted by ASIs to build data centers and generate electricity.

Sure, maybe you only need 1% of wealth to be held by people/govts that are nice, who will outbid them. But it's a huge gamble that things will turn out well.",2025-11-09T10:20:00.000Z,51,20,250,0,,neutral,-0.2

In the past it was about protecting your PRIVATE KEY (your seed phrase). In the age of big scary quantum computers (BSQC) that are coming, you need to protect your PUBLIC KEY also.

Basically a BSQC can figure out your private key from a public key.

The present day taproot addresses (the latest format) are NOT safe, these are addresses starting with ""bc1p"" and they embed the public key into the address, not good.

Prior formats hide the public key behind a hash, so a BSQC can't easily crack it.

Do this:

1) create a new segwit wallet. It will start with ""bc1q"" (NOT ""bc1p""), you can use older formats too like ones starting with ""1"" and ""3""

2) send all your BTC into this new address

3) you can continue to stack sats into this new address

4) NEVER send BTC out of it, once you do you're BSQC hackable because your public key is revealed

5) wait for Bitcoin to upgrade to a quantum safe protocol, this may take 7 years, who knows

6) send your BTC into the new quantum safe address when the network is NOT congested, once you send, you reveal the private key for a short time. It's unlikely a BSQC will steal your coins in that short window",2025-11-11T01:04:00.000Z,195,365,2020,1,BTC,positive,0.6

An HD wallet is a wallet that controls many derived addresses with a single seed phrase.

Whenever you send BTC, you publish the public key onto the blockchain so that address is now quantum vulnerable (quantum computers can crack a private key from a public key).

So whenever you send BTC, a good HD wallet should move the remaining coins to a new address inside the series of HD addresses controlled by the wallet, hence the public key holding the coins are never revealed.

HD wallets have been around for a while, the update they need is to do the last step. Also to never publish your xpub (a way to derive all of your public keys in an HD wallet).

The only way to make housing affordable is to build more housing. The free market lowers prices, not regulation.

Supply dries up, the quality collapses, and the few properties that remain skyrocket in price.

Once landlords can_ make a profit, they sell, lose properties, or walk away. Eventually, the government takes over.

Taxes will rise to pay for the promises, and the middle class will be the ones shouldering the burden. The rich will relocate, the poor will depend on subsidies, and the productive class will be squeezed from both sides.

Thriving businesses are the foundation of any thriving city. When they leave, everything else follows, jobs, schools, grocery stores, stability. Chicago already proved this.

The accountability, disclosures, legal recourse, consumer protections that make it safe for your inlaws to put their life savings in traditional funds are absolutely lacking on permissionless DeFi atm.
