10858b8,"Has Flare, FLR got the potential to become the ultimate Cross-Chain DeFi Solution?",Bashir_Jasper03,1,6,2023-01-10 09:02:09," Those who participated in the airdrop of this project just like APTOS when it was initiated exactly a year ago must be smiling rn. Tho, I joined a month later, I've got a sizeable amount of the airdrop. The project itself comes with a DeFi solution that has the potential to drive adoption being the first EVM Layer 1 blockchain to establish full interoperability of blockchains. 

Btw, after ***listing on several exchanges including Bitrue and MEXC earlier, the race has been more of ""how to deposit the over 4.27B airdrops"" to start trading tho only 15% of the airdrop is available atm***. I did try to deposit on Bitrue before listing to no avail, then a friend suggested I try MEXC which worked just perfectly. And with that, a lot of liquidity has been provided there too. Having seen a lot of DeFi projects over the years, I'm a bit confident about the success of Flare with its combo of two L1 networks striving to enable info and data be used securely and at scale from various chains. 

So, with the buzz and the robust utility of FLR, do you think it's time to look deeper into the project or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/10858b8/has_flare_flr_got_the_potential_to_become_the/,1,0,0,,positive
113kikd,Is MEXC Global Finally Creating Utility for Their Native Token?,Direct_Ad_9459,5,1,2023-02-16 07:03:23,"MEXC Global, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, is currently hosting a launchpad event that allows users to participate in new token offerings and earn airdrops. This has led many to speculate whether the exchange is finally creating utility for its native token, MX.

The launchpad event, which is currently ongoing, requires participants to hold a certain amount of MX in their accounts to be eligible for the airdrops. This has led to an increase in demand for the token, which has resulted in a surge in its price.

This is not the first time that MEXC Global has introduced initiatives that involve its native token. In the past, the exchange has launched staking programs and trading competitions that involve MX. However, these initiatives have not been enough to give the token a clear utility or purpose.

With the ongoing launchpad event, many are optimistic that MEXC Global is finally taking steps to create a clear utility for its native token. If the event proves successful, it could lead to more initiatives that involve MX and create more demand for the token.

As always, investors should do their due diligence before investing in any cryptocurrency, including MX. But for those who are already holding MX, the ongoing launchpad event could be an opportunity to earn some free tokens while also potentially benefiting from an increase in demand and price.

""We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on our most recent reviews, Coinbase has moved our GALA-USD order book to limit-only mode and will suspend trading for GALA on May 12, 2023, on or around 12pm ET. Trading will be suspended on Coinbase.com (Simple and Advanced Trade), Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. Your funds will remain accessible to you, and you will continue to have the ability to withdraw your funds at any time.

On March 15, 2023, Gala is issuing GALAV2 with a new contract address. Coinbase will not be supporting any airdrop of GALA (V1 or V2). Coinbase will also not be facilitating any upgrade from GALA to GALAV2 at this time.

GALA funds held in a Coinbase.com, Pro, Exchange or Prime account before, at, or after the planned snapshot will not entitle you to receive any GALAV2 via potential airdrops. Please refer to the official post from GALA for more information regarding GALAV2: “Out of an abundance of caution we recommend that you transfer any $GALA in custodial wallets (such as on centralized exchanges) into ERC-20 wallets entirely controlled by you before the snapshot. This will ensure your $GALA is accounted for and you are directly delivered your $GALA(v2).”

Recently the team added another liquidity pool to it's rewards program, paying a yield for contributing to the XLM, USDC, and now AQUA pairings with Cannacoin on the Stellar Network.

StashApp, a self custodial wallet for the Stellar network, has built in rewards/points program and has made sharing Cannacoin (or any Stellar Asset) easier, with the Introduction of PACKETS, a QR based airdrop and/or push system to distribute assets.  This feature has use case beyond distribution, such that retailers could easily establish a marketing program with it, bypassing the normal regulations of normal messaging communications.  

Adoption of Cannacoin into the cannabis community is made easier because of the low TX fees, speed of Stellar (most are settled within seconds!), and our focus of working within the governing laws of both sectors. 

Head over to r/stellarcannacoin to learn more.  Want to get started?  Download your Stellar wallet of choice, (mine is StashApp from the Play Store) and head to the sub for the smoke session.

1bmxod4,The Unstoppable Rise of Solana Memecoins in 2024: A New Era for Crypto Enthusiasts?,Dzerikas,1,0,2024-03-24 22:37:03,"2024 has been a year of relentless hype in the crypto market. A Bitcoin ETF was the catalyst but optimism has spread to the deepest layers of the altcoin world. Memecoins are standing out as the asset to watch in this bull market. Solana-based memecoins have been performing exceptionally strong and are outperforming the broader market.


◇Why Solana?


Solana has been intensely competing with Ethereum to be the predominant blockchain for decentralized applications and new projects. While Ethereum still stands ahead in market cap, Solana is quickly closing that gap. It’s high throughput and low transaction fees appeal to both project developers and users. Several memecoins like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Bonk Inu (BONK) have seen remarkable gains and exchange listings after choosing Solana as their underlying chain.


◇Why Memecoins? Why Now?


The appeal of meme coins goes beyond humour. Memecoins are the product of a distorted monetary and banking system which has been abused by those in power. Those in power belittle our money by making the money machine go brrrrrr. So the people have begun to choose coins that are based on cultural memes. The market has spoken. In 2024, as the crypto market continues to evolve, memecoins on Solana have tapped into a zeitgeist that values quick, viral popularity backed by strong community support. This has not only led to significant price spikes but also to a more engaged and vibrant crypto community


◇The Role of Airdrops and Community Engagement


A key factor in the success of Solana memecoins has been the strategic use of airdrops and community engagement. The BONK airdrop, for example, generated immense hype and drove token adoption, demonstrating the powerful influence of well-executed marketing strategies in the memecoin market. These memecoins gain success and adoption through winning the support of their community. These coins are truly the money of the people and should not be overlooked as merely a joke.


◇Low Market Cap Players Making Waves


One of the appeals of meme coins is the allure of finding low market cap coins that have the potential to 100x in value as their market cap increases. Typically these projects share a few key characteristics: strong communities, big marketing budgets, and a strong meme concept. This week we’ve seen new coins like Powsche (POWSCHE) grow from a $7K market cap to $500K in a matter of days, built off the back of the “need money for Porsche” meme. Although many of these projects go on to hit $100 million market caps, they inevitably crash back down when the hype dies down.


◇Looking Beyond the Hype


While the hype around memecoins is undeniable, it's essential to approach this trend with a critical eye. The volatile nature of memecoins means that while there are opportunities for significant gains, there are also risks of equally significant losses. As always, doing your due diligence and not investing more than you can afford to lose is crucial.


◇The Future of Solana Memecoins


As we look to the future, the rise of Solana memecoins in 2024 could mark just the beginning of a broader trend. With technological advancements, favorable market sentiment, and a positive regulatory environment, the stage is set for memecoins to continue their ascent.


What are your thoughts on the rise of Solana memecoins? Have you invested in any, or are you watching from the sidelines?

1btlm7g,Not the best day,Love_them_all1,1,0,2024-04-02 01:04:19,"So back when the solana Jupiter airdrop came out I had my wallet wiped. I know it was my fault and I’m the stupid one but chill I was new to crypto at the time and can own up to it being my fault. Of course I’m mad that someone literally stole my crypto but that’s on me when it comes down to it. 

Jump forward to this month, using a completely different wallet I sent some solana usdc and matic over a couple days to another wallet of mine. I am 99% certain I didn’t do anything this time because I was using a brand new computer with practically nothing installed on it so I don’t see a malware risk and have checked my files. I didn’t connect my wallet to a single unofficial website on either of these wallets and can see that when I check the pre authorized transactions they match up with the correct places. 

I forgot to mention that the two wallets were my coinbase exchange wallet and my coinbase wallet. I sent these transactions during the usdc and solana outages. Coinbase has a message pop up on my mobile app saying not to worry, my funds are safe and they were aware of the outage issue. 

A few weeks later I went through their garbage support system (had to pay for premium to talk to someone on the phone) because the funds always showed pending until now. It said on the app the other day that the transaction went through fine during the outage even though they were keeping it safe apparently. It seemed that at the same time I sent the funds they were sent out of my wallet to wallets that seemed like they belonged to an exchange but I’m no expert. 

I talked to support and followed their instructions but they said it was completed by them. Is anybody able to help me find out what the hell is going on? 

These are the transaction hashes

Laugh at me for being an idiot and not understanding where I fucked up, I just humbly don’t know how to tell if I messed up or if there’s any way in getting my funds through a block scan or what I can say to coinbase because from my view it went to “their exchange wallets” but I don’t even know what I mean by that myself. 

Thanks to anyone who tries to give it a shot, if your success I will definitely be splitting those funds with you if you walk me through what to do and it works because I feel like I need to be back in ER.

And no I will not be opening your stupid wallet wiping “rectifiers”😂😂 I understood that much by now haha.

1bzgowo,9 Actionable Steps You can take to be early with any airdrop (from someone that has gotten 9+ airdrops over the last 4y),xtarsy,6,1,2024-04-09 02:14:33,"Hey, 

I've gotten good at using protocols early and benefiting from airdrops. I don't really airdrop farm, I just use the platforms and because i don't want to have all of my funds on one wallet i split it among a few. This also has the benefit that i sometimes get airdrops on multiple wallets. 

I've gotten over $100k just in airdrops alone 

Some of the airdrops I've received include Uni, 1inch, bank (bankless), DYDX, OP, ARB, Blur, Wormhole, Lobsterdao and a few others that I can't remember.

Before we start be careful of fake airdrop links on twitter. Most platforms that market their platform with an airdrop will most likely be shit. 


1. Search for ecosystem projects with a high of VC funding. They are most likely to reward early users, as they want to attract people to their ecosystem or dapp. You can find such projects on chainbroker.
2. Identify projects with a surge in crypto Twitter followers in the last 7-30 days. Check if they have a token. If not, explore actionable steps below. X twitter follower checker

1. Join the discord/telegram and participate in the conversation (write at least 5 messages every few months

1. Use the test net do swaps and create contracts

1. Become a validator if you have the skill level

1. Take part in content competitions (I got 20k Mina for creating content in 2021)

1. Use the DApps regularly. At least once a month: Make swaps, bridge, trade. This is important for many airdrop criteria. 

1. Stake tokens: It’s harder to know which, but often projects in an ecosystem reward stakers of a similar project or in the same ecosystem. For example, DYM airdrop to TIA stakers. But do not lock tokens for a longer period of time. 

1. Be patient and understand the power of delayed gratification. 99% of the people I have shared airdrop information with have never taken action. They are too lazy and are just focused on instant gratification. I typically have to wait 6+ months to over a year.

1cklcan,The Great Memecoin Migration: Why Investors Are Flocking to Solana  ,MadShad69,1,1,2024-05-05 06:59:27,"First of all I believe every Solana meme coin investor  was once a BSC meme coin investor. Though I agree now Solana is raking a lot of volume mostly through meme coins but we got to agree that the first target of this frenzy of BSC. 

I remember before the December of 2020, everyone’s eyes keen on BTC pump with it breaking ATH after ATH at 30k USD or more ( now it’s at 60k + USD) and also the GameStop stock and the whale manipulation; these were the hot topics of the town.

Then our lovely Tesla CEO decided why not spice things and unknowingly triggered a chain of events that lead to current popularity of the meme market. Well you know what I am talking about , Elon decided to play god , becoming the first meme crypto twitter influencer shilling DOGE and kickstarted the trend of Dog coins , then Cat coins and so on !

Ethereum had the high cap meme coins but people wanted less fee charged for transactions and moving their coins , so they found BSC and the amount of coins that flooded the chain and the amount of money that poured in , it changed the lives of many people unfortunately not me as I was a bit late to trend or made poor choices 😂

After BTC hit its top , all the money flowed out from BSC and meanwhile airdrop trend on Solana where people made five figs through their Solana airdrops kickstarted the shift from BSC to Solana. But again as BTC dumped , the meme market went dead silent for a while until it recently started pumping like hell , bringing back the Solana meme market and now it’s like the go to place for meme coins.

Why Solana ? Coz its transaction fee is low compared to other smart chains and it’s fast transactions and scalability using bots like Trojan bots to run transactions at even faster rate , set limits for buy and sell , DCA and so on for coins that aren’t even listed on an exchange which shows how far meme coins have come.

The money I lost during my time in BSC , I made back through Solana meme space but overall looking long term wise , I will transition from meme coins , it’s just a means to make quick money. But as we know all means of quick money involves risk , you should be investing only money you are willing to lose and play safe in a risky market with using 10% of your total investment. Always remember realised profits are realistic and better than unrealised profits coz one thing going up, can go down anytime with the volatility in the meme space. Be greedy , take profits all the time ! 

As funny as it sounds this meme coin trading as affected my mentally and physically , spending hours scouting coins , figuring out the best ones and anxiety of making quick profits on regular basis and the sadness at minor losses. Once I have made enough , I plan to move out from trading meme coins , with allocating only minor funds which I don’t have to monitor on regular basis.

I also wonder what makes the memecoin worthy of investing/higher marketcap. Is it the ticker or is it the team and community or is it insider play pushing the coin ? Like as the name suggests shouldn’t they be based of a meme , but most of the coins out there aren’t , so shouldn’t we classify them as something else 🤔

Some coin tickers and their name do sound funny like bonk, $wif , $dogwif , $yewif and so on and makes me wanna invest but at higher market cap it’s difficult to make money , so lower market cap coins are the go to ones like michi , maneki , ye wif hat and so on.

Will this trend die at the moment? as there is a lot of money to make for and move on to safer plays beyond meme coins.

Then our lovely Tesla CEO decided why not spice things and unknowingly triggered a chain of events that lead to current popularity of the meme market. Well you know what I am talking about , Elon decided to play god , becoming the first meme crypto twitter influencer shilling doge and kickstarted the trend of Dog inspired coins like shiba, floki, dog wif hat, ye wif hat then Cat coins and so on !

Ethereum had the high cap meme coins but people wanted less fee charged for transactions and moving their coins , so they found BSC and the amount of coins that flooded the chain and the amount of money that poured in , it changed the lives of many people unfortunately not me as I was a bit late to trend or made poor choices 😂

After BTC hit its top , all the money flowed out from BSC and meanwhile airdrop trend on Solana where people made five figs through their Solana airdrops kickstarted the shift from BSC to Solana. But again as BTC dumped , the meme market went dead silent for a while until it recently started pumping like hell , bringing back the Solana meme market and now it’s like the go to place for meme coins.

So, is Elon to be blamed? What’s our next smart chain target after Solana for meme frenzy? Base chain is already popping but high fee won’t let it but who knows 🤷‍♂️",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1cm8036/is_elon_musk_to_be_blamed/,81,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, SHIB",positive

The rules are simple:

2. The only money I can earn are from competitions, giveaways, airdrops, stacking etc.
3. Any type of donation from other people must be sent away from this wallet

1dn8of3,Layer-2 Rollup Must Decentralize Sequencers or Face Consequences,Theodaud,1,0,2024-06-24 08:36:14,"In the first half of June 2024, slightly over half of all Ethereum-based transactions occurred on layer-2 (L2). This marks the first time Ethereum L2 has surpassed layer-1 (L1) in transaction volume.

The central role of the Upgrade (EIP-4844) in rollup has been pivotal in catalyzing [Ethereum](https://www.nanovest.io/kripto/eth/) L2 growth. Shortly after EIP-4844 mainnet implementation, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the L2 ecosystem reached an all-time high of $48.2 billion, with over 90% of TVL originating from rollup solutions.

Despite Upgrade providing more data to rollups, it does not resolve all issues. Most rollups still rely on centralized sequencers for improved performance and output.

This compromises the blockchain's decentralization principles, exposing users to censorship risks and significant security threats, jeopardizing sustainability. Additionally, there's a risk of one entity capturing all network value accumulation.

Rollups must not settle for centralized sequencers, and yesterday's FUD has been addressed today on Ethereum. With users preferring L2 over L1, there's urgency here.

Lessons from Linea

Users lost over $2.6 million in ETH on Linea, a zkEVM rollup supported by Consensys, due to third-party exploits on a decentralized exchange on June 2.

However, the team's unanimous decision to halt the sequencer and ""censor the attacker's addresses to protect users and developers"" within the ecosystem was more surprising.

""Decentralizing the sequencer isn't optional. Every serious L2 stack should strive to do so first,"" said Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs.

They need to do this immediately. The Linea situation demonstrates naive complacency.

Comparing themselves to older peers lagging in decentralization journey, senior officials in the Linea team showcased their superiority. At X, Declan Fox, product leader, stated, ""I'm quite pleased with our move, considering many Rollup frameworks over two years older than us aren't much further ahead.""

The confidence that ""we're better because others are worse"" has negative consequences for our industry. It impedes progress and increases risks for users, investors, and developers.

Indeed, L2 is still in its ""training wheel phase"" and requires special assistance. However, network shutdowns for hours are no longer a ""last resort.""

In recent years, many things have changed rapidly. For now, we technically have the capability to implement community incentive frameworks and basic versions of decentralized sequencers. As a result, priorities and intentions, not capabilities, are the issue.

L2 will never make it if they don't start shedding their training wheels soon. Centralization facilitates execution and prioritizes operator interests.

Conversely, decentralization is challenging and demands innovation. However, companies, projects, and their communities will greatly benefit after overcoming initial challenges.

While direct engagement in network security and governance enhances community sentiment, users also benefit from new revenue streams like sequencer mining.

For now, organizations and project owners can reduce security costs through the implementation of a 'self-strengthening model'. It also initiates a cycle where more dApps and new creators enter because higher community participation increases staking and security. This positively impacts the network and generates general prosperity.

Most rollups delay sequencer decentralization due to latency issues and their impact on user experience, if not for MEV extraction motives. Rollup users seek faster processes, and centralization comes at a cost. While such arguments may be valid for individuals like Visa, they don't apply to Web3 users.

We are all responsible as developers of the future to change the way people think. DEXs, which have seen stable liquidity inflows post-sequencer decentralization, demonstrate that if appropriate incentives and compensation are provided to users, latency can be mitigated.

Decentralizing the sequencer also aligns different goals between long-term contributors and short-term investors (speculators). This includes enhancing security through liquid staking and other methods.

Sequencer mining and other revenue-sharing models prevent users from leaving the network immediately after receiving airdrops or other free goods. This model not only shows a direct correlation between ecosystem growth, network security, and community participation but also solves user retention issues across the industry.

Everything is available now, from ancient technical examples like liquid staking token (LST) to functional examples. Even Bitcoin L2 is ready to offer mining rewards through decentralized sequencers.

If L2 OGs don't catch up, they'll lose everything. All reasons and promises of decentralization won't work. Users will vote with their tokens, as they have real options.

Those who are early in this journey should benefit. However, because ecosystem strength lies in holistic growth rather than division, it's best if every rollup project and stakeholder moves in harmony and embraces progressive standards.

Short-term gains should enable long-term innovation sustainability. This will lead everyone to a more open future.

1e0x80v,Are GameFi and AirDrops a scam?,Physical-Pudding-98,1,4,2024-07-11 19:21:53,"What's the hype about? Most new cryptos have repeated scheme - hype when launching, then dip 90%, founders make thousands, people who where stupid enough to buy get the rug pull.

+

These newly launched crypto often either don't have enough liquidity for you to trade, or you are not able to switch them to real money due to some internal stuff, where the airdrop is i.e $2, and you can exchange where the minimum amount is  i.e $50, and nonsense as such, cuz I've seen it a few times already.

Telegram is the place where most of the stuff like that happens.

HamsterKombat, GemzCoin, Pixelverse - example of GameFi. All are play-to-earn, which are supposed to be play-to-airdrop ""When it gets listed"". They all have a huge following on all social medias - but that is due to the pyramid scheme they're running, which is:

1. There is one point in the game, where you NEED to have ""friends"", or you cannot progress further = can't earn more of their game currency. So every single user, not just some people, need to advertise it however they can. It's like a breeding farm, you got 2, which multiplies to 10, 10 multiplies to 50 and that's how they grow to by a few millions subs every month. HamsterKombat in terms of growth of their YT channel is right next to MrBeast for example. It's that crazy - but the reason ""how?"" is in point number 2 below.

2. In the beginning stage of their games, you only earn like 1-10k of their currency, while they offer you 50-100k right of the bet for following their social media or watching youtube videos (and the vids ones are available every day, that's how their videos got millions of views with shitty content)

3. And finally - people see big numbers of the game currency thinking that's a lot. Their crypto is not even listed yet so people have no idea what the currency conversion is. Could be they'll be playing 2 month, being active 24/7 clicking, subing, watching, playing, and can turn out they'll earn $0.02 

4. There is already multiple version of the same exact game. All based on HamsterKombat, and HamsterKombat prolly based on Notcoin. Not a single one of them listed anywhere too lol

Yesterday night i got contacted by a guy to discuss about a coin we both invested in. We talked a bunch and he told me he is a whale and showed me his wallet. then he introduced me to a coin he made a 9x (135000 dollars worth of crypto) while telling me it’s a Binance pre-launch or something like that. Then he told me the steps to get in, and in the process i showed him screenshots of what i did so he could follow my progress, he has my public wallet address.

I first decided to look if there was any security issues and there was not. Then i invested 50 bucks to see if i could sell and i could and more than that i earned some money.

So i invested more (350 bucks) because he said there was airdrop bonus every 200$ worth of tokens, and i did get the airdrops (my balance went to 580$ after).

Right after that i decided to withdraw some and i couldn’t anymore. And he didn’t answered to me yet. Right now i steel see the number of my token and their value, but when i try to exchange on every site i can’t do it.

I know i’ve been scammed and i feel dumb for it but is there anyone who can explain to me how he was able to do that? And if there is a possibility to retrieve my money?

1elhytj,Bitcoin Reserve Bill,Arrakeen_eth,2,0,2024-08-06 13:35:14,"**B**oosting **I**nnovation, **T**echnology, and **C**ompetitiveness through **O**ptimized **I**nvestment **N**ationwide Act of 2024, or the **BITCOIN** Act of 2024….

**TL:DR** The Bitcoin Act is trying to create a Bitcoin reserve to manage the federal government's holdings of Bitcoin. They will provide a transparent purchasing plan for Bitcoin which would be held and potentially be used to reduce our nation’s debt.

“To establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and other programs to ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the Federal Government, to offset costs utilizing certain resources of the Federal Reserve System, and for other purposes.” Direct Text from the Bill

**Strategic Bitcoin Reserve:** This will create the SBR or the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” which includes decentralized secure storage facilities across the U.S. This reserve would be managed by the Secretary of Treasury (which is basically America's money manager) to keep Bitcoin and the private keys safe.

Bill Text “The Secretary shall establish 5 a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities 6 distributed across the United States, collectively to be 7 known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the cold storage age of Government Bitcoin holdings.”

**Bitcoin Purchase Program:** The government will buy 200,000 Bitcoin per year for 5 years, with scheduled buying to avoid market disruptions (which they will publish prior). Totaling 1Million Bitcoins.

**Individual Sates:** States can also store their Bitcoin holdings in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, keeping ownership of their holdings separate from other accounts. They would also keep any airdrops or forks associated with their Bitcoin.

**Funding:** The Federal Reserve (which is like the central bank of the United States) sometimes has extra money lying around called surplus funds. The Bitcoin Bill suggests taking some money from this surplus fund to buy Bitcoin and build storage facilities. Not all the surplus funds will be used, just most of it.

The Federal Reserve earns money from investing, and some of this money goes to the U.S Treasury. From 2025 to 2029, $6 billion from these earnings will be used to buy Bitcoin.

The Federal Reserve also will revalue its gold holdings and use the difference in value to fund the Bitcoin program. (no idea how this works or the process but will basically use those earnings to also buy Bitcoin.)

**The Goal:** Hold onto this Bitcoin for at least 20 years to help reduce our nation's unchecked spending. (Unless they decide to sell some to pay off debt, then they could do that) By diversifying their assets, they can strengthen the U.S. dollar.

**Bonus**: She is also helping the University of Wyoming establish a Bitcoin College Department.

**The One Thing: Consolidation of Government Bitcoin Holdings.** The bill plans to consolidate Bitcoin holdings, including approximately 210,000 Bitcoin seized from the illegal dark web site Silk Road, into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. These Bitcoins were seized due to their involvement in illegal activities. People may be split on this; can the government really seize and repurpose your Bitcoin to pay down debt?

1eq8zp5,"Bullish Indicator Resurfaces as Bitcoin Stabilizes Above $60,000",Theodaud,44,20,2024-08-12 09:10:41,"A market cycle indicator for Bitcoin, which tracks investor sentiment phases, has recently flashed a bullish signal after previously turning bearish for the first time since January 2023, following Bitcoin's drop below $50,000.

On August 5, 2024, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $49,751, known as ""Crypto Black Monday,"" marking the first drop below $50,000 since February.

This decline prompted the bull-bear cycle indicator to shift into the ""Bear"" or bearish zone. However, the indicator has since turned bullish again as Bitcoin managed to stabilize above $60,000.

According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin traded below the key $60,000 level until August 8, 2024. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was priced at $60,732, reflecting a 0.35% decrease over the past week.

The last bearish signal from the Bitcoin bull-bear cycle indicator occurred in January 2023, shortly after the collapse of FTX. Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index recorded an “Extreme Fear” score of 17 on August 6, the lowest since the FTX crash. However, this score later rebounded to a “Neutral” level of 48.

Some Bitcoin traders believe this rapid price reversal suggests that the recent price drop might have been a bear trap—a situation where experienced traders deliberately sell Bitcoin to temporarily lower asset prices and trap short sellers.

On the other hand, analysts have differing views on Bitcoin's next market direction. On August 7, Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, suggested that Bitcoin's target price might fall into the low $40,000 range before the next bull market begins.

Conversely, a report from Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest on August 6 indicated that crucial support levels for Bitcoin are at $52,000 and $46,000.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt also noted that Bitcoin’s recent decline since the halving resembles the 2015-2017 bull market cycle, implying the potential for a subsequent bull run.

With the bull-bear cycle indicator now showing a bullish signal and Bitcoin’s price stabilizing above $60,000, there is optimism that the Bitcoin market might enter a sustained bullish phase, although analysts remain divided on short- and medium-term trends.

1f0evos,I feel like so many people messing around in the Crypto space don't have the faintest idea why Bitcoin was conceived in the first place and are therefore destined to fail. ,lilapre,39,68,2024-08-24 20:32:04,"So many of these memecoins bear absolutely no resemblance to the idea behind Bitcoin and are therefore clearly (IMHO) just ploys to siphon off people's fiat currency.

People are just looking to ride a pump and dump train and make a quick buck. That's got to be a losing game for 99% of people.

Bitcoin is the only Crypto I've ever invested in, but ironically, it's not supposed to be an investment. It doesn't have any inherent value outside of being an alternate currency to fiat.

Most other Cryptos, as far as I can see:

* Do not have limited supplies:
   * This means they ARE going to be inflationary in the long run. i.e. you shouldn't use them as a store of wealth. The value will go down as the supply increases. One of Bitcoin's core concepts was the idea that, because fiat currencies can be created at the whim of the central banks, the central banks essentially have the power over us all. Bitcoin is inherently DEFLATIONARY because it will have a limited supply. Forever.
* Are not actually anonymous (this includes Bitcoin if you trade it on an exchange):
   * If you're using an exchange that requires your ID to participate, your transactions are tracked just like the normal banking system. Again, this is totally contrary to the core principles of Bitcoin, that transactions are transparent to the market, and therefore cannot (in theory) be manipulated, but also cannot be traced to the individual, once again removing the power of the government over its citizens.

These two core principles are, again, the key reason why Bitcoin has gained so much value over the years. Because it appeared to be a legitimate, transparent alternative to fiat currency, that could be traded safely, and anonymously, so people bought it, to do just that. Opportunists saw the opportunity to make a quick buck from doing pump and dumps and an entirely new industry was formed off the back of it, which ignored the real reason for Bitcoin's initial ""success"". (I put ""success"" in inverted commas because it was never designed to be used as an investment vehicle.)

Eventually, people are going to catch wind of the fact that 99% of new coins are just scams. Ponzi schemes designed to part you from your money.

I would love for someone to convince me that other coins in the market ARE good investments, but it's going to take some convincing.

[BullBear Trading](https://substack.com/@bullbear)

Sep 08, 2024

I’ve been saying for months that the action in Bitcoin since March has been a sideways consolidation that will eventually lead to a renewal of the long term bull market and a large rally. Recent action may give cause for reflection on this view.

While it’s too soon to declare the bull case dead, bulls do need to buy the recent dip here to prevent the chart from potentially shifting bearish....

1fddxik,Coinbase Market Share Declines as Smaller Exchanges Gain Strength,Theodaud,1,0,2024-09-10 09:42:44,"
Coinbase has experienced a significant drop in market share as smaller exchanges have gained momentum in recent months, according to a report by research firm Kaiko on September 9. Earlier this year, Coinbase controlled more than half of the U.S. crypto market, peaking at nearly 55% in March. However, its market share has since fallen to 41% by early September, down from 53% in June. The biggest beneficiary of this shift has been Bullish, whose market share almost doubled from 17% to 33% over the same period. Unlike Coinbase, which primarily serves retail investors, Bullish mainly targets institutional clients and trading. Bullish, founded in 2021 as a subsidiary of blockchain company Block.one, is backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. The company recently made headlines for its acquisition of the crypto-focused media outlet, CoinDesk. **Dominance of the Top 3 Exchanges** Meanwhile, the top U.S. exchanges have significantly expanded their market share since 2021. According to Kaiko, the three largest exchanges by volume now control almost 90% of the market, up from 66% in April 2021. Conversely, smaller exchanges have seen their market share shrink from 34% to 11%. Kaiko attributes this trend to several factors, including stricter regulations, reduced trading activity during the 2022-2023 bear market, and the dominance of major players like Coinbase and Kraken in institutional crypto trading. Additionally, the dominance of these exchanges has been linked to the sudden collapse of FTX in 2022 and regulatory actions against Binance.US, which led to a decline in its market share. **Coinbase Stock Performance** Coinbase’s market share decline comes as UK bank Barclays upgraded its COIN stock from underweight to equal weight. Financial giant analyst Benjamin Budish noted that Coinbase has matured through product expansion and improving economic prospects. Budish also highlighted that Coinbase could benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment. With market observers expecting both U.S. presidential candidates to show increased support for the crypto industry, the Brian Armstrong-led exchange could emerge as a winner in this regulatory shift. However, the analyst cautioned that uncertainty remains, particularly regarding the broader economic environment and ongoing regulatory challenges. Notably, the unresolved lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to loom over its operations. Despite these challenges, Coinbase shares rose about 5% in early trading today, according to TradingView data. However, the company’s overall performance this year has been down, with its stock dropping 10%.

1fgc5cw,VC Investment vs. Launchpads: The Shifting Landscape of Crypto Funding,WowHow06,3,5,2024-09-14 02:31:55,"VC investment in crypto has always followed the ups and downs of Bitcoin and the broader market. When Bitcoin hit $69k in November 2021, VC funding soared to nearly $12B in Q1 2022. But in 2023, the bear market scared many VCs away, leaving total funds raised far behind.

Meanwhile, the crypto bear market, marked by exchange collapses, hacks, and scams, collided with the AI boom, diverting VC attention from web3 projects. Even as the blockchain industry matured, it struggled with inconsistent VC participation due to volatility and lessons learned from the 2017 ICO era.

Enter IDO platforms: an alternative funding route that became popular during the last bull run. Launchpads like DAO Maker and Polkastarter gave crypto communities and retail investors a decentralized way to access early-stage projects, while still providing valuable resources to institutional players. These platforms aligned with the industry’s values and helped projects weather tough market conditions.

A great example is Pencils Protocol, which built an entire DeFi platform offering Farming, Vaults, and Auctions. With over 400,000 active users and $300M in Total Value Locked (TVL), Pencils Protocol showcases how community-driven platforms can empower users to take control of their financial future.

Now, multichain launchpads like ChainGPT and Seedify are setting the new standard, enabling more projects to thrive, despite regulatory scrutiny. Many launchpads are now acting as incubators and accelerators, playing a more hands-on role with the projects they onboard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1fgc5cw/vc_investment_vs_launchpads_the_shifting/,3,1,1,BTC,positive

1fq0l0k,gTrade (GNS) Expands to Base!,0xjomahe,4,0,2024-09-26 16:37:04,"gTrade is launching on BASE this week! gTrade expands its decentralized leverage trading platform to the growing Base ecosystem! What is gTrade? gTrade is a perpetual leverage DEX and is often the highest revenue-producing protocol on #Arbitrum on a month to month basis. With this expansion, gTrade aims to bring its impressive DeFi suite to even more customers!

Here are some awesome features in a nutshell:

Over 210 assets to trade, including crypto, forex, and commodities & plenty of BASE memes!

Leverage available up to 150x on crypto, 1000x on forex, and 250x on commodities

Scamwick filtering: we take a median price from multiple sources to give you the spot price, no more scamwicks!

Guaranteed order execution through our novel infrastructure. Orders are accurate even during high chain congestion!

One-click orders - no more fumbling with your ledger or metamask to trade a candle!

Full self custody - gTrade does not take deposits! Your Keys, Your Crypto!

Decentralized front end, Decentralized oracle network, decentralization is KEY to gTrade!

Fully bootstrapped, never used VC’s, Paid listings, completely community owned project!

A slick UI, rapid listing of assets, future CCIP integration partner, and so much more!

To date, gTrade has processed over $80 BILLION in volume! That’s 100% organic!

What’s the plan for BASE?

gTrade will launch with the gUSDC vault, which will allow users to stake USDC and receive gUSDC.. an yield bearing asset. Our launch partner Maverick will incentivize liquidity in the gUSDC / USDC pool, and our second partner, TimeSwap will allow you to take out loans against your gUSDC!

With the USDC vault in place, traders will have access to our 200+ pairs using USDC as trade collateral. Our gUSDC vault stakers will be protected by an over collateral layer migrated from Polygon.

Once gTrade has launched, expect a trading competition with tens of thousands in prizes just for Base users in a few weeks!

How about the Tokenomics?

Glad you asked!

With more potential customers, come more fees for $GNS stakers. gTrade shares over 55% of protocol revenue with $GNS token holders through the staking program. The heart of gTrade’s protocol is the $GNS token, which has been net deflationary and is fully diluted. Fun fact: gTrade has never used VCs, angel investors, or paid for listings. Every VC was shown the door!

gTrade has been battle-tested by numerous audit groups, including Certik, Halborn, and Pashov. We take security seriously, and to date, there have been no major security incidents involving the $GNS token or the gToken Vaults. gTrade has been serving traders with its current architecture since 2021,

Here is the short term Base roadmap: [https://gainsnetwork-io.medium.com/gtrade-expands-to-base-a-strategic-rollout-b6422f77045e](https://gainsnetwork-io.medium.com/gtrade-expands-to-base-a-strategic-rollout-b6422f77045e)

Risks of using the platform include, but are not limited to:

Loss of funds due to hacks, smart contract errors, etc.

Loss of funds from tokenomic effects, such as traders winning and under-collateralizing the vault

Loss of funds from using the platform for leverage trading

I’m looking for an alternative to Kraken Pro that I can use as a second option. Overall, I’m very satisfied with Kraken Pro, but I don’t want to be completely dependent on one exchange. Unfortunately, my search so far has been unsuccessful, as no exchange meets my requirements. The following are important to me:

* **BaFin regulation**
* **Low fees** (similar to Kraken Pro)
* Ability to **deposit and withdraw large amounts** without issues (500k+ if necessary)
* **Verification** to higher levels must be possible without major problems
* **Staking options** (especially important for staking stablecoins to bridge bear markets, Kraken offers 6.5% interest here)
* **Reasonably fast support** (Kraken Pro’s support is also rather average)
* Not only **Bitcoin**, but also a few **altcoins** like Ethereum, AVAX, etc. should be available to trade
* At least the ability to set up **2FA** (2FA via SMS does not count!)
* **Additional security features** like Krakens GSL (Global Settings Lock)

Is there such an alternative in Germany?

1gc9t2n,"Side-by-Side Comparison of BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL Liquid Staking Tokens for Solana",Hijastronaut,2,2,2024-10-26 01:13:42,"Alright, if you’re into staking on Solana but still want to keep things liquid, you’ve probably come across BGSOL, BNSOL, and bbSOL. These tokens basically let you earn staking rewards while staying flexible with your assets. I did a little digging, so here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out which one might suit you best.

# Estimated APR & Earnings

* **BGSOL**: This one’s got a solid base APR of **8.15%**, but with extra incentives from Bitget, it can hit **30.15%**. Plus, if you stake the first **$1,000** via Bitget Wallet on the Solayer Restaking Network, you can earn **up to 25% APY**. Not too shabby, right?
* **BNSOL**: The APR here is **dynamic**, but Binance hasn’t shared exact numbers (thanks, Binance 🙄).
* **bbSOL**: No fees at all – **0% management fee, 0% validator commission,** and **0% withdrawal fees**. The only cost is a **0.1% SOL deposit fee**. So if you're allergic to fees, bbSOL might be the move.

# Redemption & Liquidity

* **BGSOL**: No lock-in period – you can **redeem whenever** you feel like it.
* **BNSOL**: There’s a **4-day wait** if you want to convert BNSOL back to SOL.
* **bbSOL**: It’s **tradeable** on Bybit and other exchanges. The info I found didn’t say if there’s a waiting period, so it seems pretty chill on that front.

# Where You Can Use These Tokens

* **BGSOL**: Works across a bunch of DeFi platforms like **Orca Dex, Solayer, Kamino**, and **Save Lending**. Also gets you access to Bitget’s **LaunchPool and PoolX**, plus potential **airdrops**.
* **BNSOL**: Mostly useful on **Binance** for **trading, lending**, or adding to **liquidity pools**.
* **bbSOL**: You can use it with **Orca, Kamino**, and **Solayer** – nice little DeFi ecosystem going on here.

# What Makes Each One Special

* **BGSOL**: Comes with **Active Validator Set (AVS) delegation**, making it faster and more secure.
* **BNSOL**: Super simple with a **one-click staking process** and the usual Binance-level security and support.
* **bbSOL**: It’s the **first exchange-backed LST** and runs on the **SPL stake pool program**, which has gone through a bunch of audits.

# So, Which One’s Right for You?

Honestly, it all comes down to what you’re after:

* If you want **higher APR** and more **DeFi options**, go with **BGSOL**.
* If you’re already using **Binance** a lot, **BNSOL** makes sense.
* If you hate fees and like **trading your tokens freely**, **bbSOL** is the way to go.

  
So yeah, for me BGSOL really seems to steal the spotlight, especially if you’re looking for high rewards, flexibility, and utility. What do you guys think? Let me know would love to hear your thoughts!

Unsure of the correct flair to attach 

I have futures positions opened and while I’m not necessarily concerned that they will get liquidated or hit the SL’s given they would have to correct and tank (until the inevitable crash happens that ushers in the next bear market) I am concerned that the liquidation prices seems to have now adjusted to where I now had to update my SL since it was now below what it was saying what the liquidation price would be - which has changed because I was very specific with where I put my Stop Loss orders

I’m also confused and kind of annoyed that my margin seems to be changing. I divided it up so there was 200 USDT put into each position and now the position margins have steadily decreased to 180-190 USDT, why is this happening? I’m bothered that this will continue to happen as my gains rise and thus inevitably diminish what should be gains of a $200 position to a $160 position for instance…that’s a 20% loss in the overall profit amount I should be making. E.g if my inevitable profit from my $200 USDT futures position was $10,000 it could end up only being like $6,000-$7,000 because for some reason my margin is changing

These coins are ONLY based on market sentiment. I.e. BTC did not do anything but be hyped up. It will hit 100k ONLY because everyone wants it to hit 100k. That's not investing. 

Crypto is going to go somewhere, yes. We will likely use a decentralized block chain as a new way to regulate fiat money like the dollar or euro. But not even BTC will be that coin. 

If you want to make money on the market, you are not too late. Pick a big boy coin, buy it and don't sell it. The red is coming. Most of you at this point will have to wait for the next run. If you look at any market, you'll see we entered a bull market in 2020, and it crashed 2021. It's up now, but it will end. If you end up buying the top, just wait a few years. 


That is all. Just trying to help. Please don't dump your life savings, or your grocery money for the week. Not many of us are in a good place. Don't think this is your ticket out.

1. SOL: 1.9X to 459$ market cap 219.48B

2. SUI: 3X to 12.81$ MC 37B

3. AERO: 5X to 11.35$ MC 8.05B

4. SKI: 3.75X to 0.98$ MC 1B

5. TURBO: 3X to 0.033$ MC 2.27B

9. MOONWELL: 6X to 0.52$ MC 1.6B

10. BASED PEPE: 4.5X to 0.000076$ MC 324M

11. FWOG: 2.5X to 1.25$ MC 1.23B

Points to note: These multipliers are based on the crypto's current market cap and narrative. It is important to not be a moon boy. Remember that all YouTubers call from a X10 from here with every coin. ""Sol 1000$"" will probably not happen. It will not be that way, so many tokens out on exchanges. Take profits and set price targets, and if it's life changing money flip it all into BTC in the inevitable bear market. BTC is king. Become a btc maxi once you have gained enough with alts. Alts are too much stress tracking 10 cryptos. With btc you won't have to chart check, there is faith in it long term. Sell and don't hodl in the bear market, trust me, holding through a bear market is tough and not fun. Years of your life wasted. Better to keep doing a X4 each bullrun, it will add up. Better a 15X in a total of 4 cycles than starting from zero each time.

Dogecoin reached an astounding peak of 85B in 2021. Not all memes will do this of course, but I'm trying to say that a few X on memes to 2.5B market cap is not too surprising. 

Additionally, until now and until it finishes i believe this will be a meme cycle. Memes will be the steongest narrative. It gives people a sense of community, are fun, no VCs involved, complete circulating supply. A way for the poor to get wealthy. Power to the people. Newer retail will not be as interested in tech or fundamentals as memes. They are easy. ""Look a dog wif a hat how fun, ill throw 1k in there!"" 

Furthermore, I am obviously very bullish on the BASE chain. I think it's the ecosystem with the most room to grow. Hence some of my positions in there. Full disclosure, I have positions in each of these tokens, Sol is my blue chip 25% of portfolio.

If anyone has any constructive critisims on if you think one of these crypto will do better or worse please comment. You can also do one of those remind me in 12 months. It will be fun to see how these turned out (first supercycle? Way higher or much lower than I imagened?) you can roast me after!

Stay safe out there crypto bros and sisters, it's a brutal market, and try and have fun along the way.

I get an airdrop on the Phantom Wallet app. I thought okay thats cool check it out. I check it out and it says I have to connect my account so I do but here’s were I went full dummy, you have to log in with your seed recovery phrase. Smh. I want to punch the past me who thought he was boutta get gifts while on the toilet. Basically nothing happened, it wouldn’t connect and so I just ignored it. I could’ve pulled out im very annoyed.

All the experienced guys shaking their head at me rn, rookie mistake, dumb mistake, embarrassing mistake.

JUST BECAUSE THE AIRDROP IS ON THE WALLET YOU TRUST DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN TRUST IT.

I didnt know that. GUESS I SHOULDA DONE MY RESEARCH.

Question to the community tho: is there any responsibility on wallet providers(especially for beginners) to ensure there arent scam airdrops or to at least warn the user? Is there ones that do that or unavoidable? 

Thanks in advance for your answers, if ur newer than me be smart and learn from me dont rush into it, dont share your seed phrase, dont think you can trust airdrops and do some research. 

Speaking of, do y’all have recommendations for my research? There’s so much crap on the internet, is there any free and trusted crypto knowledge source? How do I study this?

To preface, as a complete beginner, I'm planning on putting in \~$200 (will probably DCA but for now, just assume a single $200 sum) spread among the a few big coins such as BTC, XRP, and XLM. I have little to no intention of frequently trading and just plan on letting whatever I put in sit for a year, watch it and hopefully gain some experience + learn some valuable lessons during said year, and if all goes well, get a little more involved afterwards. (I also simply don't have a lot of time as a relatively new college student 😭)

Apologies in advance if any of these are dumb questions but at the moment, I'm looking at Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken and honestly feel like the more research I do, the more confused I'm getting. I'm particularly worried about fees as I'm only investing a small amount and from what I understand, smaller amounts typically warrant much higher fees? Are fee amounts impacted by how frequently I deposit, buy, and withdraw as well? Since my I am planning on just leaving it there, should I even be worried about fees at all? I also remember reading, but not quite understanding, a thread somewhere that recommended using USDC instead of USD to avoid fees?

I'm also going to transfer everything after buying to a cold wallet, which I understand the concept of but not so much how do about doing so yet. Recs for those would be great too.

And, what's the deal with all these Pro plan options? Are they worth purchasing for a beginner like me? One in particular is ""Coinbase Advanced."" Everything I've found explaining it is somewhat vague; I read somewhere it is the same as Coinbase Pro, somewhere else that its a better option than either, and another that its ideal to use them at the same time??

So my idea to make some ”safe” money while learning is to invest in like 10 alt coins with 10k. 1k in each. And cash out as soon as a coin hit 2x. And if a coin dosent hit the 2x I will just hold it until the next bullrun and DCA during the bear market.

1hbuhnc,This week I dove into the dark world of meme coins and it was absolutely disgusting.,Garvinjist,129,141,2024-12-11 14:19:48,"So I fell for it. I was browsing various crypto based posts on Reddit and kept seeing people commenting: “Bro fire up dexscreener, Jupiter, and Photon if you want to make a bag on scam coins”. I tried it for myself and man was I completely shook. I understand the building blocks of crypto, the importance of a deregulated currency etc. I have to tell you guys that after a week of playing with these coins that something about this has to be regulated. It put a bad taste in my mouth for anything crypto. 

Firstly if you understood the absolute massive number of scam coins being created in a second/minutes/day it’s unbelievable. 99% of them are rugs. The dev can pump a coin to bonding level amass a large group of holders then just sell out. It’s a 1:1 comparison to the CSGO lotto some years back. It’s literally premium gambling but worse. You would be better off going to the casino. 

Not to mention that these coins are not regulated, so they can be named racist, criminal, sexist things. The scam coins inhibit and breed a toxic culture. You might even be familiar with sell out 1 hit wonder content creators creating scam coins and selling out as well. It’s all happening right now. You might not think much about it but as a whole these coins hurt the crypto ecosystem. 

I’m sure most of your sentiments about my stance would be “Yea but just let people dumb enough to play with scam coins do it, if you don’t like it then stay away”. Sure, that’s fine but I’m arguing that they have created a monster that they did not want to create. This stuff has going on for many years, but only now are people seeing it in the open.

1hdc8os,Best DePIN projects ,CryptoConnexions,8,17,2024-12-13 13:30:59,"With the next bull-run about to go crazy, DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure) is looking like it will be the darling category. Every other category has the stigma of being magic internet money made up of only ones and zeros. But DePIN projects have physical, tangible assets that your can hold and point to as something that exists in the real world. DePIN will appeal to traditional stockmarket investors and act as the bridge between investing in real world assets and digital assets.


With that in mind, what’s your favourite DePIN project? Please don't just shill a ticker without sharing info such as:

1. Real-world problem it solves,
2. Physical assets that exist,
3. Non-crypto partnerships (real-world companies that see value in crypto projects), 
4. Buyback / burn mechanism 
5. Number of users,
6. Market cap,
7. Token price (all time low, current, all time high)
8. Circulating supply etc
9. Total supply
 
I'll go first. My pick is World Mobile Token (WMTx)

Real-World Problem: 40% of earth’s population still have ZERO internet access. Telecomms is a $3 Trillion industry. By providing cheap mobile and internet access (Starlink is not cheap. But World Mobile does work with Starlink for their backhaul services), World Mobile plans to Connect the Unconnected (1 billion by 2030).

 

Physical Assets

- Aerostat: Their biggest physical asset was launched in Mozambique at the end of 2023. The World Mobile Aerostat is essentially a blimp that is tethered to the ground. It hovers at 300 metres and provides internet access to everyone within a 75km radius. 

- Air Nodes (many variations and sizes, but picture a box with an antenna connected to a pole with solar panels at the top and rechargeable batteries at the bottom),

- Earth Nodes (computer that validates transactions on the blockchain)

- Aether Nodes (the bridge between legacy telco and World Mobile infrastructure, typically one per country).
 

Partnerships

- StarLink/SpaceX partnership. The link below is a recently released documentary where WMTx employees & Starlink/SpaceX employees (the lead Engineer is Charles Hoskinson's cousin) jump in a Black Hawk helicopter (owned by Charles Hoskinson), fly around a town in North Carolina (after the recent Hurricane Helene demolished the area) and brought back internet and Cellular service. SpaceX / StarLink guys were super impressed with WMTx tech and say as much in the doco:
https://youtu.be/pGyK2pWkt8c?si=nHV3-LNLHBw9BU0z

- Vodacom (part of the Vodafone Group) partnership was  announced at the end of 2023 when WM launched the Aerostar. You can google and see the Vodacom logo on the side of the blimp.

- Fulham FC: World Mobile Logo on sleeves of the 11th ranked English Premier League football team

- Epson: partnering to bring education to underserved communities (internet, computers, projectors and printers)
 

Stats (from www.worldmobile.io)

-Multi-Chains: Native on Eth, Base, Cardano, Arbitrum

-Daily Active Users: 547,678

-Average revenue per user: $1.50 per month in Africa, $55 per month in USA

-Locations: Zanzibar, Pakistan, USA (Reno for now but all states as of January 2025), Mozambique

-Air Nodes: 6445 currently

-Earth Nodes: maximum 1000

-Market Cap: $288M

-Price: all time low $0.09, current $0.58, high $0.96

-Circulating Supply: 491 million

-Total supply: 2 Billion

-Buyback mechanism: Real world user needs internet, downloads World Mobile eSIM, pays for data and phone plan (WMTx have their own licensed spectrum where as Helium is a reseller of T-Mobile) with real money which goes into World Mobile treasury, 18% of this is then used to BUY BACK WMTx from the exchanges thus creating organic buy pressure. To date, World Mobile has already bought back $1M worth of WMTx. That is $1M that came from people purchasing data. Not $1m from degens like us. That's 547,678 active daily users who know nothing about crypto and have no idea they're even involved in crypto.

1he5w7p,STOP GETTING RUGPULLED - POV & Strategy From a veteran trader.,timecop1983,158,39,2024-12-14 15:59:37,"I saw a post on this earlier and agree with the sentiment and while it did provide some useful logic, it didn't necessarily show people what to look out for. Let me start by breaking down how this all works. I'm taking time out of my busy saturday to write this all out and explain this to you guys, so I would appreciate upvotes, and thoughtful support.

First, you must understand that crypto is unregulated, because of this it attracts people that want to take advantage of others without the consequences they would have in the regulated financial markets. That's how it starts, organized crime (aka Cabals) have eventually taken over and their primary goal is to extract as much liquidity from retail as possible and unfortunately, they've gotten VERY good at this.

Before I explain to you all some things to look out for to avoid these cabal coins, let me first start by telling you how they run their operation for context.

They take some of the tried and true methods from traditional boiler rooms, if you don't know what this is you should watch wolf of wallstreet or boiler room, both are excellent movies and give you a decent ideal how these operations work.

However, instead of people cold calling, they have people (wagies) farming social media accounts, primarily on X but also on reddit, tik tok, insta etc. They have a vast network of social media accounts, many are ""influencers"" or ""KOLS"" that ""call plays"" or ""leak alpha"". These accounts are top of their pyramid, the other accounts are there to share, like, tweet and support these accounts to game the algorithm, these are the mid tier pyramid accounts and finally, the bot network, at the bottom tier, is there to fake volume to trick users into believing there is a positive sentiment or ""hype"" around a token when in fact, it's all manufactured by the cabal. Bots will like posts, follow users and join spaces to try and trick users into believing something is popular (don't believe any follower count on X in crypto, 99% of them are botted to seem important, gain your confidence etc.).

Now, they create a ""culture"" and ""meta"" a meta is simply a trending narrative, like AI, or dog coins or celebrety coins etc. They use the same method above into tricking people into believing narratives they manufacture so people are more likely to buy their newly created tokens then something else, this is highly manipulative but like i said before, their operation is extremely sophisticated.

The second step is ""marketing"" outside their own influencer and social media web farm, they will pay other influencers, trending sites, crypto news sites and tools like dextools or dexscreener etc. to make their tokens trending so they get more eyes on them, impressions, and seem more popular than other tokens, again, this is part of the ""hype"" building. These tokens will also fit in the narrative or meta they create.

Now how do you spot these tokens? well, first is understanding the above, the other way is understanding the latest tricks because rugs evolve, once users catch on to it, they create a new way to trick users out of their money.

The current rug method being deployed is actually pretty genius. Hawk Tuah token did this and several other tokens have done this and are currently doing it to some extent.

Here's how it works: Launch a token, use their own bot snipers to snipe the launch price so they control 70-80% of the supply, add a lot of liquidity, dust thousands of wallets (dusting is simply sending pennies or sometimes even a few dollars worth of a token to thousands of wallets to fake and manipulate the holder count - another way to add to the fake ""hype"" they generate for a token).

Once they control the supply, are dusting 50,000 holders over the next few days, they use trading bots to wash trade the token to generate volume, this will boost the trending metrics for the token so they trend highly (top 1-10) and organically on sites like coingecko, coinmarketcap, dextools, dexscreener etc. again, this creates hype, fomo and gets more views on it at the same time.

Now there are different types of rugs, some are geared at quick launches on pump fun, pumping them and then dumping their tokens or removing the liquidity - this is amateur shit.

The big leagues with the big operations will use the method I previously mentioned because if they own 70-80% of the supply, retail traders that get suckered in through X/social media or see it trending on site see the volume, see the holder count, see the narrative, then they see the green candles, their fomo takes over and they start buying - This is exactly what the cabals expect to happen.

As long as they don't sell their initial sniped supply, using wash trading and organic trading, they can moon these tokens to 500-1 bil mcaps overnight or in just a few days, which again, is exactly what they want.

Why?

We are talking about INSANE PROFITS. If they sniped the launch price and are selling on a 100,000x that's millions upon millions of profits, their goal is to start dumping at a market cap of hundreds of millions of dollars if not even a billion, at this rate the smart schemes will do this with hundreds of different wallets to obfuscate what they are doing and make it look more organic trading. The bad ones well, you can just see the top wallets in etherscan hold the majority of the supply. Now, they will keep this sharade going as long as possible, the really good ones will keep hyping it up with their social media account farms and other various tricks while their wallets keep liquidating.

This is also known as a ""slow rug"". Once they finally finish selling, the chart will be down 70-99% and never recoverable unless maybe the community takes over or the scam narrative is so good the organic attention takes off even after the cabal is out but that's extremely rare. Once they are done selling the social media hype dies, it's never mentioned again by the influencers and it becomes a dead token.

So how do you know? One, you need to follow the right people (like martytalk or muststopmurad, that are anti-cabal and are experienced and been around awhile).

It's actually easy to audit contracts, coffeezilla and many others use the same tool which is free to use, bubblemaps dot io. It will show all the linked wallets from the contract, and all the wallets that have been dusted, because everything is on-chain, this saves countless hours of doing the investigation ad-hoc and simplifies everything with a visual representation.

You CAN make insane gains on memecoins but you need to get into one with a strong ORGANIC community that's ran by a community, that's why I suggest following accounts like MUSTSTOPMURAD who has done all the initial due dilligence for you and you can learn from him to do your own.

Sorry for the long post but there is just so much to go over, I hope you took something useful away from this all and can use it to better understand the current crypto market scams and what to look out for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1he5w7p/stop_getting_rugpulled_pov_strategy_from_a/,158,1,1,DOT,positive

1hh4hyo,Altcoins bull market will never happen,oskar88895,0,85,2024-12-18 15:51:06,"Let’s be real. This time is different.

I’ve been investing in crypto since October 2023, which turned out to be a perfect time to jump in. My portfolio started with 50% BTC, 20% ETH, and 30% altcoins.

But let me tell you—altcoins have been seriously underperforming. I knew Bitcoin was going to break out and head toward new all-time highs (ATH), so I thought, “No problem, alts will catch up.”

When BTC hit $35k, I figured normies were still scared, thinking we were in a bear market. I decided to give alts some time.
When we hit $45k, I told myself, “Alright, once Bitcoin approaches its ATH, optimism will return, and alts will follow.”
Then Bitcoin actually broke its ATH. I thought, “Here we go! The magic is about to happen!”

But here we are in December, and even with Bitcoin’s insane November pump, most altcoins are still below 50% of their March 2024 highs—let alone their peaks from 2021. Sure, a handful of coins have pumped 500%, but out of 10,000 altcoins, only 10 did that. Unless you got insanely lucky, you missed those moves. Even the big names like ETH, ADA, and DOT are nowhere near their highs.

So I said, “Just wait for the magical $100k.” BTC keeps climbing, $100k isn’t even a struggle anymore, and yet altcoins are still a disaster. Some lost 50% of their November gains in a single week. They’re now down 70% from March 2024 and 80–90% from their 2021 peaks.

So stop saying things like:

""Alts have pumped!""
""Altcoin season is coming!""
It’s not happening. It will never happen.

1hindlj,The Cryptocurrency Market: A Tool for Economic Control?,TTHODLIFER,1,5,2024-12-20 16:21:18,"The cryptocurrency market, often lauded as a beacon of economic freedom, has taken a tumultuous turn in recent years. What was once a movement driven by decentralization, empowerment, and financial sovereignty now appears to be under siege by powerful institutions and governments. A growing number of voices within the crypto community argue that what we are witnessing is not the natural evolution of the market, but a deliberate manipulation designed to strip retail investors of their stake, ensuring that the wealth and control remain concentrated in the hands of a select few.  

The crypto boom of the last decade gave retail investors unprecedented access to wealth creation, challenging traditional financial systems. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies promised a future free from centralized control, where individuals could take ownership of their financial destinies. However, as the market grew, so too did the interest of major institutions, hedge funds, and even governments.  

Many argue that these powerful entities have now turned their attention to systematically dismantling the retail investor base. How? Through tactics like sudden price swings, regulatory crackdowns, and coordinated media campaigns that cast cryptocurrencies in a negative light. These actions create uncertainty, causing smaller investors to panic and sell off their holdings at low prices. Meanwhile, institutions swoop in, buying up assets at a discount, consolidating their influence over the market.  

The recent waves of market instability—dramatic crashes followed by mysterious recoveries—lend credence to this theory. Retail investors, often trading with emotion and limited resources, are the first to feel the pinch. Meanwhile, institutions armed with insider knowledge and sophisticated trading algorithms profit from the chaos. The result? The dream of financial independence via cryptocurrency slips further out of reach for the average person.  

However, hope is far from lost. The true key to breaking free lies in adopting a strategy that mirrors the patience and discipline of the very institutions that seek to control the market: buy and hold. While manipulation, fear, uncertainty, and doubt may temporarily shake retail confidence, the long-term trajectory of cryptocurrency adoption remains strong. By accumulating and holding the cryptocurrencies favored by these institutions—assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Chainlink—you align yourself with their long-term vision, even as they attempt to force you out through shakeouts and bear traps.  

This path isn’t easy. Institutions and governments will employ every tool at their disposal to discourage you: dramatic price surges designed to tempt you into selling too soon, crushing market downturns to shake your resolve, and regulatory overreach to sow doubt in the system. But if you can resist these pressures, if you can endure and hold onto your stake through the noise, you still have a chance to achieve the economic freedom that cryptocurrencies originally promised.  

The fight for financial independence in this manipulated market requires more than just hope—it requires grit, strategy, and an unwavering belief in the power of crypto’s underlying technology. The institutions may try to monopolize the future of money, but with patience and determination, retail investors can still claim their share of that future. Economic freedom is still possible, but the road there will be one of endurance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hindlj/the_cryptocurrency_market_a_tool_for_economic/,1,1,1,"BTC, ETH, XRP",positive

But strangely that hasn't happened yet. Ethereum peaked at around $4800 in 2021 when Bitcoin reached its then-ATH of $68K, and so did Solana when it reached $250 around that same time. So I would imagine those two alts would skyrocket well beyond those ATHs during this bull run after BTC finally hit the six-figure mark. But it still hasn't happened yet; in fact they haven't even reached their 2021 ATHs yet.

Sitting at $73,Fun-Seaworthiness419,4,3,2024-12-31 19:59:20,"Compound is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The platform operates as a permissionless, algorithmic money market, where users can earn interest on their digital assets or access liquidity by borrowing against their holdings. 

The core of Compound's functionality is its smart contract-based pools for supported assets, such as ETH, USDC, and DAI. Users who supply assets to these pools receive interest-bearing tokens called cTokens (e.g., cETH, cDAI), which represent their stake and accrue interest over time. Interest rates are determined algorithmically based on the supply and demand for each asset within the protocol.

Borrowers can collateralize their holdings to take out loans in other assets, with the platform ensuring over-collateralization to minimize risk. If the value of a borrower's collateral falls below a required threshold, the system can liquidate their position to maintain solvency.

Compound is governed by its native COMP token, which enables decentralized decision-making. COMP holders can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, such as adding new assets or adjusting risk parameters. This democratized governance structure makes Compound a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hqmpfi/comp_to_500_10mil_supply_sitting_at_73/,4,1,1,ETH,neutral

1hsk0hc,In the event of all out nuclear war- ChatGPT  ,Current_Area_4218,0,4,2025-01-03 11:00:24,"Sure! Let’s brainstorm some potential contingency plans to ensure cryptocurrencies survive even in catastrophic scenarios, such as a global nuclear war wiping out nodes and backups. These ideas range from practical to futuristic:

1. Redundant, Decentralized Backups
	•	Cold Storage Nodes:
	•	Encourage people and institutions to store copies of blockchains on disconnected (air-gapped) systems, like external hard drives or DVDs.
	•	Regularly update these backups and distribute them to different regions worldwide.
	•	Global Backup Network:
	•	Create an independent, decentralized network of nodes that only store blockchain data without participating in real-time validation (e.g., satellite-based or solar-powered nodes).

2. Satellite Blockchain Nodes
	•	Satellite Nodes:
	•	Launch satellites into orbit that continuously store and update blockchain data.
	•	Example: Bitcoin already has Blockstream satellites broadcasting blockchain data globally.
	•	Resilient Communication:
	•	Equip satellites with solar panels to remain operational even during ground-based power failures.
	•	Allow people to access the blockchain via radio, satellite phones, or other low-tech means in post-apocalyptic conditions.

3. Interplanetary Blockchain
	•	Off-Earth Nodes:
	•	Maintain copies of blockchains on systems outside Earth (e.g., on the Moon or Mars).
	•	This ensures the blockchain survives even if Earth-based infrastructure is destroyed.
	•	Collaboration with Space Agencies:
	•	Work with organizations like NASA or SpaceX to make off-Earth blockchain backups a reality.

4. Decentralized Physical Records
	•	Human-readable Ledger:
	•	Regularly print blockchain data (e.g., public/private key pairs and transaction histories) onto durable, non-degradable materials like metal or stone.
	•	These records could be used to rebuild the blockchain manually.
	•	Regional Blockchain Shards:
	•	Break the blockchain into smaller “shards” and store them physically in various underground bunkers or archives around the world.

5. Blockchain Reconstruction Mechanisms
	•	Distributed Trust Recovery:
	•	Develop protocols to reconstruct a blockchain from fragmented or incomplete data, assuming at least some nodes survive.
	•	Use cryptographic proofs to ensure the rebuilt blockchain is legitimate.
	•	Snapshot Recovery:
	•	Periodically create “state snapshots” of blockchains (balances and ownership only) that could be used to restart the network without full transaction history.

6. Integration with Other Systems
	•	Merge with Legacy Systems:
	•	Create bridges to legacy financial systems, so cryptocurrencies can be “cashed out” into traditional forms if the blockchain infrastructure is damaged.
	•	Multi-Network Storage:
	•	Distribute blockchain data across multiple systems, such as torrents, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), or other decentralized storage networks.

7. Self-Replicating Technology
	•	AI-Powered Nodes:
	•	Develop AI that can autonomously replicate blockchain nodes and rebuild the network if infrastructure is destroyed.
	•	DNA Storage:
	•	Store blockchain data in synthetic DNA, a futuristic but highly durable storage medium with immense capacity.

8. Community and Governance Solutions
	•	Global Blockchain Bunkers:
	•	Create international agreements to maintain secure, underground blockchain bunkers in geopolitically stable regions.
	•	Blockchain Recovery Councils:
	•	Form decentralized, community-led councils with the authority to restore blockchains in extreme scenarios.

9. Post-Apocalypse Scenarios
	•	Low-Tech Reboot:
	•	Develop paper-based systems to temporarily track cryptocurrency balances until digital systems are restored.
	•	Bartering with Keys:
	•	Use private/public keys as a form of “bearer instrument,” allowing people to trade keys directly in a decentralized barter economy.

10. Hybrid Systems
	•	Blockchain + Physical Assets:
	•	Tie cryptocurrencies to physical assets stored in disaster-proof facilities, such as gold, to retain value even if the blockchain is inaccessible.
	•	Quantum Blockchain:
	•	Explore quantum computing to create blockchain systems that can self-restore even from minimal data.

1htbe7p,To the people getting into crypto recently,Stunning-Ask3032,57,36,2025-01-04 10:06:39,"The crypto community is an essential part of anyone’s journey in this space, and honestly, it’s something I underestimated when I first got started. Like many others, I thought diving into cryptocurrency was all about researching projects, studying charts, and maybe reading a few articles here and there. But as I spent more time in the space, it became clear that the community is where the real value lies. It’s not just about knowledge it’s about connections, support, and growth.

Learning Made Easier

Let’s face it: crypto can be intimidating when you’re starting out. The concepts, terminology, and sheer volume of information can feel overwhelming. That’s where the community steps in. Whether it’s a Reddit thread, a Discord server, or a Twitter (or X) space, you’ll find people willing to explain things in a way that actually makes sense. I’ve learned more from conversations in forums than I ever did from a whitepaper. People in these spaces share their experiences, break down complicated ideas, and provide actionable advice. It’s like having a team of mentors at your fingertips.

Real-Time Updates

The crypto market moves faster than anything I’ve ever seen. One minute you’re hearing about a new project, and the next, it’s blowing up. Being part of a community keeps you in the loop. Whether it’s spotting a new trend, hearing about a token before it gains traction, or staying informed about regulatory updates, the community is like your own news network. They’re always a step ahead of mainstream media, and that kind of edge can make a huge difference in how you approach the market.

Networking and Opportunities

Another major benefit of being part of the crypto community is the networking potential. Crypto isn’t just about trading it’s about building something bigger. Whether you’re interested in DeFi, NFTs, or blockchain development, you’ll find people who share your passions. The connections you make can lead to collaborations, partnerships, or even career opportunities. I’ve personally discovered projects and investment opportunities through casual conversations in Telegram groups that I wouldn’t have found on my own. Exchanges too have found out by my own example - bitget which I joined long time.

Support When It Matters

Crypto isn’t always sunshine and rainbows. There are losses, market crashes, and moments where you’ll question if you’re even doing the right thing. During those tough times, the community is a lifeline. They’ve been there too, and their advice, encouragement, and shared experiences help you stay grounded. Knowing you’re not alone in the ups and downs makes the journey a lot more manageable.

Let’s be real the crypto space has its fair share of risks. From scams to phishing attempts, it’s easy to make mistakes, especially if you’re new. The community is one of the best places to learn about staying safe. I’ve avoided rug pulls and other shady schemes thanks to warnings and advice shared in community forums. The collective awareness of the community is like an extra layer of protection you didn’t know you needed.


The crypto community is more than just a group of people—it’s a resource, a network, and a support system all rolled into one. If you’re navigating the crypto world alone, you’re missing out on one of the most powerful tools at your disposal. Engaging with the community has completely transformed my approach to crypto, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone serious about this space.

Exchanges too need to be chosen wisely like bitget making new highs everyday. This bull run is quite different from others. But soon a drop is coming ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1htbe7p/to_the_people_getting_into_crypto_recently/,57,0,0,,positive

Additionally, isn’t it unlikely that their prices will rise substantially further after these events, considering how high they already are?

1hv9owx,How to reduce a harmful tendency driving bad investments,LuminousAviator,1,0,2025-01-06 20:59:08,"The tendency – a particular cognitive bias – expresses the behaviour of cryptocurrency investors to sell assets that have increased in value too early, while clinging too long to those that lost value relative to the initial investment. The bias, called the **disposition effect**, has big consequences, often preventing inexperienced investors from maximizing returns. I wrote a longer, detailed piece on the topic of this bias for [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/the-ethernal-cryptonaut/how-to-reduce-a-harmful-tendency-driving-bad-investments-xevkkpy), so if you'd like to read a full article, you can head over there.

*Anyway, here's what the researchers have found out*:

**The Root Cause:** this behavior is driven by loss aversion, a principle of Prospect Theory, where the pain of a loss is felt more strongly than the pleasure of a gain.

**Impact on Gains:** Selling winners prematurely prevents investors from fully benefiting from compounding returns (CAGR).

**Impact on Losses:** Holding onto losers leads to accumulating losses, killing portfolio value and preventing recovery.

**Psychological Factors:**

* Selling winners provides a sense of accomplishment and avoids potential future losses.
* Holding onto losers avoids admitting a mistake and maintains hope for recovery.
* *Cognitive dissonance* plays a role in justifying holding onto losing investments.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Simply being aware of the disposition effect can help reduce its impact.
* Develop a well-defined investment plan.
* Use stop-loss orders consistently.
* Conduct regular portfolio reviews.
* Focus on fundamental analysis.
* Cultivate emotional detachment.

Myself, I felt many times for holding to cryptos that only kept losing in value, instead of cutting my losses and, at the same selling too early, just to feel good I nailed a trade. Those that have kept BTC and never parted with it, have been reaping the rewards last and the current year.

I hope understanding the disposition effect will make your portfolio grow so much faster in 2025!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hv9owx/how_to_reduce_a_harmful_tendency_driving_bad/,1,1,1,BTC,positive

1hw1c11,Why Most People Will Never Make Money with Crypto (and How You Can Beat the Odds),Awarewolf19,537,241,2025-01-07 20:37:50,"I’ve been diving deep into the world of crypto trading, and let me tell you — 99% of people fail because they approach it wrong. They get lured in by the hype, throw their money into random coins, and then cry when the market turns. But there’s a small percentage of people who consistently win. Why? They understand the game.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: Making money with crypto isn’t just about buying Bitcoin and praying it goes to the moon. It’s about strategy, discipline, and knowing the systems most people ignore.

What No One Tells You:

1. You’re Gambling, Not Trading: Most people don’t even know the difference between a swing trade and a long-term hold. Are you relying on market manipulation, or do you have a strategy backed by research? Think about it.


2. The Game is Rigged for the Rich: The whales (big players) are moving the market. If you’re following Twitter hype or the latest meme coin, you’re already late to the party. You’re playing in their game, and trust me, they want you to lose.


3. Time Isn’t On Your Side: If you think you’ll get rich overnight, you’ve already lost. The real money is made by those who stay patient, build systems, and play the long game.



The Solution? (A Taste…)

Start Small, Start Smart: Begin with a secure wallet, learn the basics of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and experiment with small trades. Resources like The Bitcoin Standard and Cryptoassets can change your entire perspective.

Research, Research, Research: Learn how to analyze projects, study whitepapers, and understand tokenomics. This is where 90% of people are too lazy to dig in — and where your opportunity lies.

Follow The Data, Not The Noise: Forget TikTok moonshot picks. Use tools like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap and dig into charts on TradingView.


I’ve been where most beginners are, and I know how overwhelming it can be. My biggest advice? Focus on learning, even if it feels like you’re moving slowly. The truth is, most people want shortcuts, and that’s why they fail.

If you’re serious about making this work, there’s a wealth of knowledge out there — it’s just scattered. Start with the basics, and don’t let FOMO drive your decisions. The few who win are the ones who play the long game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hw1c11/why_most_people_will_never_make_money_with_crypto/,537,1,1,BTC,neutral

1hxszla,Texas Court Seizes $124M in Bitcoin – Is Crypto Privacy a Joke Now?,dadcooksstuff,415,577,2025-01-10 01:29:09,"So the federal court in Texas just ordered a guy to cough up the private keys to a $124 million Bitcoin stash. Let that sink in. His private keys. In a world where “not your keys, not your coins” is gospel, the government basically said, “Yeah, hand ‘em over, mate.”

Frank Richard Ahlgren III (fancy name, but clearly not fancy with taxes) made bank flipping Bitcoin between 2017-2019 and conveniently forgot to tell Uncle Sam about it. The IRS caught on, and now he’s looking at two years in prison, a $1M fine, and losing access to his wallet.

Now, let’s talk implications, because this isn’t just about one guy’s tax evasion — it’s about what this could mean for all of us:

	1.	Privacy? LOL.
A court made him hand over private keys. PRIVATE keys. That’s supposed to be the last line of defense for crypto holders. If a judge can compel you to surrender your keys, what’s stopping more cases like this? The whole idea of Bitcoin being beyond government control is starting to look shaky.

	2.	Regulators Are Salivating.
The IRS isn’t just “keeping an eye” on crypto anymore. They’re fully locked and loaded. If you think you can casually dodge taxes on your crypto gains, think again. You might get away with it for a bit, but when they catch you, they’ll come for everything.

	3.	Future of Seizures?
This sets a legal precedent. Governments now see that they can go after private keys if they have a legal reason. Today it’s for tax evasion. Tomorrow? Who knows — maybe just not filling out the right forms could be enough.

So what I get from this is, If you think you’re invincible holding Bitcoin, you’re not. If you don’t have your sh*t together , tax-wise and privacy-wise, you’re walking into a buzzsaw. Privacy-focused coins like Monero are starting to look less like a niche interest and more like a necessity.

And let’s be real, if the government can do this in a country that prides itself on “freedom,” it’s only a matter of time before other governments follow suit.

1hxz0no,My Crypto Investment Strategy for Long-Term Passive Investing with DCA,Affectionate-Ad-4966,8,3,2025-01-10 07:19:17,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been investing in stocks for a while now, with **70% of my portfolio currently in the stock market**. Recently, I decided to take on more risk and venture into the crypto space with a **long-term passive investment approach**. I’m not interested in chasing the next 100x coin or getting into day trading. My goal is to **diversify into crypto, automate my investments**, and hold for the long term.

At first, I explored a few crypto groups, but most of them were focused on **trading signals and short-term strategies**, which don’t align with my goals. So, I started researching crypto ETFs. While most ETFs I found were **heavily weighted toward Bitcoin and Ethereum**, I wanted **broader exposure to altcoins** to take advantage of the higher risk-reward potential in this space.

During my research, I came across the **Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF**, which is primarily for institutional investors. It’s heavily weighted toward Bitcoin but also includes some altcoins. Inspired by its composition, I decided to **adjust the weightings** to reduce Bitcoin’s dominance and increase exposure to altcoins. Here’s how I redistributed the weights:

|**Coin**|**Original Weight (%)**|**Redistributed Weight (%)**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BTC|72.3|30|
|ETH|14.2|20|
|XRP|5.6|10|
|SOL|4.8|15|
|ADA|1.6|5|
|LINK|0.5|5|
|AVAX|0.4|5|
|LTC|0.4|5|
|UNI|0.3|5|

Using this allocation, I’ve set up an **auto-invest plan on Binance** to **DCA (Dollar-Cost Average)** into these coins every month. My plan is to maintain a diversified crypto portfolio with exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum while also holding some **promising altcoins** for long-term growth. I’ll also rebalance the portfolio quarterly, in line with the **Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF’s rebalancing schedule**.

What are your thoughts on this strategy? Do you think these allocations make sense for someone focused on **long-term passive growth**? Would you recommend any adjustments?

I’d love to hear your insights and feedback. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1hxz0no/my_crypto_investment_strategy_for_longterm/,8,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, LTC",positive
1hyp6lm,"With all of this considered, how can you Not be Bullish???",BenniBoom707,36,37,2025-01-11 05:38:43,"As the title states, I want to open up a discussion. There is *a ton* of opinions flying around about what is going to happen in the near future. I have been into crypto since 2017, and consider myself someone who is “-“all in” when it comes to crypto. I don’t believe in traditional banking. I have a background in finance, and I know too much about our current financial industry to trust it. 

I have been seeing the feeds flooded lately with a lot of doom and gloom posts about the current state of the Crypto Market. A suspicious amount of posts talking about the “Cycle is ending in March-April”, or “I’ll be fully out by 2025”, whatever it may be, there is an alarming amount of FUD going on, and to an OG like me, this is just another Bullish indicator. Now let’s dig in…

***Current Political Climate***

While many of you May or may not disagree with the current Administration, we are about to enter a very “Pro-Crypto” era of government. Something that is unprecedented. We generally have a government pushing against us, not with us. This Administration has announced that they will be the “First Pro-Crypto” Administration. One that wants to build the US into a Crypto and Blockchain powerhouse. Whether you like the President or not, this is *imperative* to the future of our country, and a very Bullish indicator….

*But what does this mean?*

When the Money Printer gets turned back on, a lot of that funding will be directed towards the Crypto industry.

They have also announced that they want to start the “Bitcoin Reserve”. Potentially buying Trillions of Dollar in BTC, to attempt to offset our looming and massive National deficit. This is also absolutely imperative. We must have this so the future generations aren’t burdened with debt and poverty caused by the Dollar that we are seeing today.

Now let me be clear with you, Trump does not want to pump crypto because he “loves the tech”. This is purely a money grab. We know he has a wallet with over $7 million in ETH. His family is deeply invested as well, and has done a few rug pulls with some NFT projects and the infamous Worldcoin project. He is going to pump the market to pump his own bags, simple as that.

***Institutional Investors: A Race to Control the Supply***

I don’t really have to spell this out to you. The big dogs are here. They want the whole shop. Ask yourself an honest question; *does  the world’s largest wealth manager want to accumulate the supply of Bitcoin, because they think the price will tank?* Extremely unlikely. We are currently witnessing a race to control the Supply of Bitcoin, and it’s happening by the top 0.1% of the wealthiest in the world. As this supply continues to dwindle, the price will continue to incrementally climb for Bitcoin, and probably the market as a whole. *Our lives will end and Billionaires will still be fighting to Control the supply, let that sink in…*

With the ETH ETF, and possible SOL and XRP ETFs also in the works, clearly Wall Street has their eye on the Crypto market. I’m not a fan of ETFs, because I know that’s how Wall Street gets away with a lot of their manipulation. ETFs are potentially bad for crypto in the long run, because they are just basically creating synthetic crypto, which is no different than Stock. However, for the sake of the conversation as a whole, I think Wall Street money flooding into these projects will only help the market in the near future.

***Quantitive Easing: The Money Printer Turns Back on.***

One thing is guaranteed over the next 4 years: Trump *must* have the “Greatest Economy in US History.” With that being said, he will turn the money printer back on with Quantitive Easing. Trump printed $8 Trillion, in a 4 year period. In comparison, Obama printed $9 Trillion over 8 years amidst the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. This isn’t to bag on Trump. This is just pointing out, he loves to pump money into the economy. Mark My Words here: Trump will have spent $10 Trillion by end of 2028, pumping up the Greatest Economy in history. A lot of that money will flow into Crypto…

Based on previous performance, Bitcoin is setting up exactly like it had prior to the last 3 major Bull runs. I think what we are currently witnessing is one of the last consolidation periods before our next big Leg up. This Bull cycle could possibly extend much longer than anticipated as BTC dominance still remains over 60%, which is generally a sign that Alt Season has not officially started yet.

***TLDR: With so many Bullish indicators and positive sentiment, how can you not be extremely Bullish about the current market state??***

***EDIT: This is just a Bullish post about the Market in general. I don’t own any Bitcoin currently, full disclosure. I’m deeply invested in Alt Coins, and won’t name any projects for the sake of the conversation.***

***Please present your Best Bear Case to debate my Bull Case. I want this to be a serious conversation, but anyone has yet to bring a legit Bear Case to the conversation.

🚨 Here’s my concern: I haven’t received any updates yet (which makes sense, given market conditions), but I’m wondering if anyone has actually tested this feature and received real notifications?

❓ Has anyone here gotten alerts at the right time?
❓ Did it help you make better exit decisions?
❓ Or is this just a placebo that makes you feel prepared but doesn’t actually trigger anything?

Would love to hear if this has worked for anyone, or if I should just stick to my own market monitoring.

1i2io3n,"FYI: Price is irrelevant. Market Cap, is everything.",BenniBoom707,400,93,2025-01-16 06:17:33,"Based on the posts and comments on this sub, I feel like we should discuss Market Cap for the newer people on here. However, I have found that even the Veterans make mistakes here.

As stated in the Title, price is irrelevant. Price of the coin does not matter at all, *it’s just a reference point*. Market Cap tells the *actual* value of the coin.

For those who don’t know:
***Market Cap = Price of currency x total supply***

When you are looking at a crypto, and only basing it on the Price, you are missing the main component of determining value.

Here’s an Example: 

+ Coin A has a price of $1 and a Market Cap $100 Billion. 
+ Coin B has a price of $1 and a market Cap of $100 million. 
+ Coin A increased its market Cap by $1 Billion, that’s a Gain of 1%, price increased to 
$1.01
+ Coin B Market Cap increases by the same amount, that’s a Gain of roughly 1000% and price increased to $11.

In that example, Coin B outperforms Coin A significantly and it was all due to size of Market Cap.

When I see these Memecoins with a price of $0.0000001 and a supply of Billions, I believe these are all just scams meant to create bag holders….

People see the coin at $0.000001 and think *”When it hits $1 I will be a Billionaire”* And I feel bad for them honestly. What they don’t realize is that coin already has a Market Cap of $1 Billion+. For that coin to hit $1, the Market Cap would have to be $100 Trillion, or the value of the entire world’s stock market. This will never happen, and people will HODL forever thinking someday it will hit. It won’t.

The entire crypto Market Cap right now is $3.3 Trillion. It was about $4 Trillion during the last ATH. Bitcoin has a market cap of around $2 Trillion, which is about 60% of the entire market.

For reference Tesla is $1.37 Trillion at this time. Apple is around $3.5 Trillion.

So, for you to think your shitcoin is going to someday be worth 20-30X the value of Apple, probably never going to happen. But if you were only looking at price, you wouldn’t see this.

With all the hype and speculation going on, you want to be able to decipher what assets are undervalued. People with no understanding of this are the loudest in the room, and they think you are going to pump their bags or worst, take them.

Being able to identify undervalued market caps has been a key factor for me on a bunch of successful trades. When the market starts to pump, it leaves a lot of stuff behind. This is where the value is found. Keep in mind that, many of these alts are still down 95% from their ATH. When price discovery occurs, you can see some crazy gains depending on how low the market cap has gone.

***EDIT #1: Thank you all for the constructive engagement on this post. I am actually surprised how many people are appreciating this post, and it shows me there still may be some hope left for us. Someone pointed out another important understanding when it comes to Market Cap- the difference between “Total Supply” and “Circulating Supply.”***

1) Total Supply is the Total amount of Coins that were minted.

2) Circulating Supply is the Total amount of coins that are “in circulation”. 

Example: *If Circulating Supply is 90%, and there is 1 Million Total Supply, then that means there is 100,000 that has not been released by Devs. This can cause major problems if they decide to liquidate, as they would be Diluting the Market Cap. If the Market Cap of Said coin is $1 Billion, and this is based on a Circulating Supply of 900,000 this means each coin is worth $11.11 If the Market Cap remains the same, but now all coins are in circulation, this means the price is now $10 per coin. Meaning you lost roughly 10% and nothing changed as far as the value of the coin. This is why I never buy coins with less than 95% of coins in Circulation.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i2io3n/fyi_price_is_irrelevant_market_cap_is_everything/,400,1,1,BTC,neutral

1i2x6r6,What have I learned during the last four years?,BlueberryEvery,30,10,2025-01-16 19:33:16,"Hey,

It has been four years since I became serious about crypto, and I would like to share my small learnings, especially with the newbies. I'll save you some times: there are no revolutionary secrets to get rich here.

Why am I taking this time to write this post? Because I would have loved to receive sincere advice when I started.

So, first and most important, don't FOMO! Be patient. There will always be opportunities waiting for you. Don't listen to people on the internet or on TV, otherwise, you'll end up as their exit liquidity.

Secondly, find what works to you, stick to it and focus on mastering it.

In my case, I tried to build trading bots, arbitrage bots and day trading... I realized that I needed to invest a lot of time to master those fields, which didn't align with my professional life. Like many people here, I have a busy job. However, investing matched my personality and my lifestyle. So, since then, I've stuck to it and worked on mastering it.

Here's what I've learned crypto investment:

* Build your own strategy and stick to it.
* Build your own discipline and mindset, just like an athlete. (Follow a plan to learn, read and analyze)
* You don't need fancy strategies. Choose a simple strategy that works for you.

As I said, nothing revolutionary right? My strategy is even more boring:

""Sell during bull markets (or save money if you're just starting), buy during bear markets.""

I won't be hurt if you call me ""Mr Obvious"", but sometimes the simplest things are the most effective.

When I was starting my journey, I believed that I needed to create a new fancy strategy, with complex techniques or algorithms, to outperform the average and make a profit.

I later realized that  the vast majority of people fail on the basics.

If you master the basics, you will outperform the average and automatically become profitable.

So, this is what seems to work for me. If I had known this earlier, I think I would have made more money. But no regrets, it's all part of the process.

In parallel, I'm now trying to develop some skills in swing trading.

I'm still new to the crypto field. I didn't experience all the previous bull runs, and I still have a lot to learn. So I'm open to your advice and criticism.

I hope my story helped some people here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i2x6r6/what_have_i_learned_during_the_last_four_years/,30,0,0,,positive
1i344m7,Potential Altcoin Rally and Precautions,Fit_Significance_549,147,37,2025-01-17 00:44:34,"
What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin in the Upcoming Period? What Happened in the 2021 Altcoin Rally? How Long Will the Altcoin Rally Last and How Will It Unfold?

I will answer the questions of what we should do to not miss the altcoin rally, whether an altcoin rally is necessary, and more in detail.

First, let's examine what happened during the 2021 Bull Market and the Altcoin Rally, particularly in the last quarter of the Bull Market, and look at what occurred in Bitcoin Dominance:

In the 2021 Bull Market, the most enthusiastic phase of the altcoin rally started in the last quarter of the Bull Market, specifically in January 2021. At that time, Bitcoin dropped by 30% from $42,000 to $29,000, and Bitcoin dominance fell for 5 months, decreasing from 70% to 40%. After this drop to $29,000, Bitcoin rose by 2x from $29,000 to $65,000. However, altcoins, which had been lagging behind Bitcoin for a long time, surged 50x to 100x, marking their real rally.

Looking back at the 2021 Bull Market, from the March 2020 crash at $3,150 until January 2021, Bitcoin increased about 13 times, while altcoins were stagnant. When Bitcoin dominance reached its peak at 70% in January 2021, and dominance started to fall, Bitcoin only increased by 2x, while altcoins surged 50x to 100x.

Regarding Bitcoin dominance, it is inaccurate to say that ""once Bitcoin dominance reaches 70%, an altcoin rally begins."" Bitcoin dominance first hit 70% in July 2019, and it remained stuck between 70% and 60% until January 2021.

In the current period, most altcoins are down by 50% from their recent highs. Many altcoins completed their rallies before the 50% drop, and back in December 2023, when Bitcoin dominance was at 55%, people were already saying, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are at 55%, the altcoin rally is coming soon, let’s prepare our retirement portfolio."" I shared my thoughts on this back in December 2023.

Here is an excerpt from my December 2023 post:

___

When Bitcoin dominance hit 70% in July 2019, we said, ""Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are rising together, dominance may have peaked, and the altcoin rally will start soon."" We then added the top 10 altcoins of that time to our ""altcoin portfolio"" and awaited the drop in Bitcoin dominance to trigger the altcoin rally.

1- ETH: $363 buy, after crash $115, -68% loss  
2- XRP: $0.31 buy, after crash $0.17, -45% loss  
3- LTC: $145 buy, after crash $36, -75% loss  
4- EOS: $8 buy, after crash $2, -75% loss  
5- TRX: $0.04 buy, after crash $0.01, -70% loss  
6- ADA: $0.1 buy, after crash $0.03, -70% loss  
7- XLM: $0.12 buy, after crash $0.04, -70% loss  
8- XMR: $121 buy, after crash $43, -64% loss  
9- LEO: $2.1 buy, after crash $0.76, -64% loss  
10- DASH: $190 buy, after crash $38, -80% loss  

As you can see, our altcoin portfolio, made when Bitcoin dominance was at 70%, ended up with an average of -70% losses. If we had invested a significant amount into this portfolio without leaving any cash aside, during the long bear market of 1.5 years, our funds would have been severely eroded. As the market began to rise and we believed the bull market had started, many of us would have invested all our funds, only to see a 70% drop again. Our psychology would have been severely affected, family relationships strained, and our sleep disturbed. Some would have irrationally turned to gamble-like thinking, trying to recover their losses by putting all their remaining funds into the market, risking everything.

I believe there is a great deal of misinformation on Twitter regarding the interpretation of Bitcoin dominance, which has led many to be misdirected. I think that Bitcoin dominance may be approaching a peak around 55%. The altcoin rally in the final quarter of the next bull market could be triggered by Bitcoin dominance falling from 55% to 25%-30%. Personally, I believe this scenario will unfold during the final quarter of the next bull market. However, my main question is: how do we know for sure that Bitcoin dominance's rise will trigger the altcoin rally? We have seen such events before, but we cannot know with certainty when it will happen again.

Even now, when Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance are both rising, and altcoins are falling, people are prematurely declaring the bull market has definitely begun and the altcoin rally is imminent, which I believe is highly dangerous and misleading.

___

Three months after my December 2023 post, most altcoins have experienced a 50% drop.

Back when Bitcoin was around $16,000-$17,000, I predicted that during the upcoming rise, Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance would rise together, meaning altcoins would see relatively less profit and that altcoins would likely see losses against Bitcoin. I switched to Bitcoin, and when Bitcoin dominance hit the 50%-58% range, I began shifting back into altcoins and transparently shared my altcoin portfolio.

Looking ahead, if the 2019 intermediate rally had unfolded differently, we would have expected a 50% drop in Bitcoin and a 70% drop in altcoins before the peak was reached. Initially, I thought we might see a drop from $42,000 to $29,000, but I was wrong. Now, Bitcoin has surpassed the previous peak of $65,000 without experiencing a similar crash, but most altcoins have completed their intermediate rally and are in the decline phase.

As for Bitcoin dominance, it first reached 70% in July 2019, and after a 530-day squeeze between 70% and 60%, it eventually fell to 40%, followed by a 4-month altcoin rally. Today, Bitcoin dominance has been stuck between 50% and 55% for around 200 days. A decline from this level could trigger an altcoin rally lasting about 4 months.

My personal view is that the bull market will follow the pattern of previous cycles, with the most likely peak happening between April and May 2025.

This suggests that after the summer of 2024, we should expect the rise to begin, and the altcoin rally could start by the end of 2024. However, if we experience an unprecedentedly long bull market, it could extend until the end of 2025. This is also a possibility, and if this happens, our expectations will be delayed by 6-7 months. Given the uncertainty, we should remain cautious, avoid margin trading, and focus on spot trading to protect ourselves from any unexpected crashes.

Looking at the altcoin rally in 2021, examining the coins that performed well, such as Hot, Chz, Avax, Solana, Band, Wrx, Matic, Sand, and Doge, we can analyze how the upcoming altcoin rally may unfold.

In my posts, I typically mention that the altcoin rally in the final 4 months of a bull market will occur in 3 phases. Let’s take a closer look at these phases.

**Phase 1: ""Excluding Old Investors""**

After a few months of modest gains, we will witness a sharp 70%-100% increase in altcoins in a single day. This will be followed by a 50% drop. During this phase, most people will begin selling their assets, and many will fall into the dangerous mindset of ""I sold at the peak, I will never buy again."" This will cause many to miss out on the true altcoin rally.

**Phase 2: ""Big Regret""**

After the 50% drop, a short-term zig-zag pattern will unfold, lasting around 30 days, with significant gains and losses. This phase will be psychologically exhausting for many investors, as they experience the emotional rollercoaster of regret for missing out on the earlier rally.

**Phase 3: ""The Swamp""**

The final phase, which typically lasts 2 weeks, is when altcoins will see an explosive rise of 100%-500% within a short period. This phase is crucial, as it marks the transition from euphoric gains to the beginning of the bear market, with altcoins dropping by 75% from their peak.

---

**Final Thoughts:**

The crypto market is highly volatile, and no one can predict with certainty what will happen next. However, based on historical patterns, I strongly believe that an altcoin rally, similar to what we saw in the 2021 bull market, is inevitable. The influx of new investors into the market is driven by altcoins, and their spectacular rises act as advertisements to draw in new money.

While participating in this market, it’s essential to avoid the ""I’ve solved this market"" mentality. The most dangerous psychological trap in crypto is overconfidence, which leads many investors to make irrational decisions, and often lose everything.

Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that in crypto, you are more likely to be the prey than the predator. Properly managing your risk, setting clear goals, and understanding the potential pitfalls can help you navigate this market more successfully.

Be cautious and remain aware of the risks.

1i3ocaw,About Altcoin Rally,Fit_Significance_549,121,28,2025-01-17 19:21:11,"There is only one thing I am sure about in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets:

That is, a future Altcoin Rally, like the one that took place between January 2021 and May 2021, is UNAVOIDABLE.

The driving force behind the cryptocurrency market is new investors entering the market. For this engine to keep running, it is essential to attract new investors to crypto.

The best way to attract new investors to crypto is through altcoins. In the most euphoric days of a Bull Market, people don't come because Bitcoin increased 10x in two years, from $15,500 to $150,000. They come because an altcoin has surged 100x in just 2 months. As they see people making incredible money in a very short time, they think, ""Everyone is winning, I can win too,"" and new investors are drawn in.

The hardships and struggles of the old investors who endured the 3-year Bear Market are forgotten. It seems as though people get rich quickly, as if it's an easy path to wealth.

Because of this, during the most euphoric days of the Bull Market, altcoins that rise 50x - 100x are not used as investment vehicles, but as marketing tools. Altcoin Rallies are used to attract new investors to the market and create buyers for altcoins that would be worthless under normal circumstances.

In the cryptocurrency market, us small investors don't make the market rise, nor do we make it fall by selling. When we put money into the market, buy coins as if we're buying a house, and think they’ll never drop, that's when the Bull Market peaks, and in two years, altcoins drop at least 95%. During the Bloody Days of the Bear Market, when we give up, are scared to buy, and lose interest in the market, that's when the rises begin. We have no influence on the market.

Therefore, don’t pay attention to comments like, ""everyone is waiting for an altcoin rally, what everyone expects won’t happen, they won’t let it happen."" If they want to take our money, if they want to attract new people to the market during a Bear Market that will last 3 years, if they want to create buyers for worthless altcoins, they are OBLIGATED to create an Altcoin Rally.

I am personally certain that the upcoming Altcoin Rally will be visible, the majority of the market will miss it, and when we approach the peak, most people will not wake up from the fairy tale in time and will fall into the swamp as I mention on my previous post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i3ocaw/about_altcoin_rally/,121,1,1,BTC,positive
1i44x58,Official Trump Coin Greatest Rugpull or Greatest Wealth Creator?,nvysage,317,915,2025-01-18 10:38:29,"6 hours ago I saw Trump's tweet about the launch of official Trump Coin.

The only truth in this market is the market cycle.

Similarly, even though Trump may praise Bitcoin and create coins in the future, it won't stop the Bear Market that is expected in 2026, 2027, and 2028. No news or event will prevent the upcoming Bear Market.

I believe the next Bear Market will create the largest number of victims in crypto history. The approval of ETFs and Trump constantly praising Bitcoin will lure many people into the crypto world, including those who don't even know what crypto is, and many will fall into FOMO.

For FOMO to begin, the Altcoin Rally must first take place.

No matter how much positive news is served to the market, people won't enter unless the investors inside are making money.

In the 2021 Bull Market, Bitcoin rose tenfold from $3,150 to $30,000, but no new investors came in. During the Altcoin Rally that started in January 2021, Altcoins rose 50 to 100 times in a very short time, and people who made significant profits from Altcoins brought new investors into the market with the mindset of ""everyone is winning, I want to win too.""

In the Bear Market, the struggles we endured for three years will be ignored, and it will be said, ""These people are making money the quick and easy way."" Bankrupt exchanges and coins will be forgotten because of the insanely rising Altcoins.

In 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest exchange at the time and comparable to today's Binance, collapsed after 140,000 Bitcoins were stolen. Thousands of people were victimized, but during the 2017 Bull Market, Altcoins that rose 100 times made people forget about past incidents, and new investors were lured into the market to become the next Bear Market victims.

The Altcoin Rally is used as bait to attract new victims who will be the next Bear Market casualties.

This bait will make people forget about bankrupt coins and the victims of the FTX collapse. It will attract new investors who will become the next victims of the Bear Market.

I am surprised by the questions I see today, such as ""Has the Bear Market started? Was the Bull Market in March 2024 already over?""

The Bear Market lasts for three years. The main goal of the Bear Market is to sell off the overinflated and near-worthless coins that were bought during the Bull Market, under the belief that every dip is an opportunity to buy.

During the Bear Market, the market doesn't fall sharply like it does now. It gradually declines over three years. Every dip is seen as a buying opportunity, so we keep buying worthless, deflated coins. Sometimes, the market is suddenly pumped, and we get excited, thinking, ""Could the Bull Market be starting again? Will the market rise like it did when we first entered?""

The market doesn't drop suddenly to scare us; it gradually declines to encourage us to buy.

During the three years of the Bear Market, buyers must be created for those who want to sell their coins. These buyers are generated through the Altcoin Rally.

For this Ponzi-like system to continue, new investors must be drawn into the market.

No matter what happens, whether Trump makes Bitcoin a reserve asset or not, whether the Fed raises or lowers interest rates, whether a war breaks out or not, the Altcoin Rally must happen.

1i6ingv,Dynamic DCA (+28%) and Trading (+140%): My Market-Aware Bitcoin Strategies,Timrael,14,2,2025-01-21 13:32:43,"Hi Reddit,

As a passive Bitcoin investor, I’ve always appreciated the simplicity of **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)**—investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. It’s a stress-free way to accumulate Bitcoin without worrying about timing the market.

That said, I couldn’t shake the feeling that DCA, while effective, might not be the most efficient strategy for Bitcoin specifically. I know the whole point of DCA is to invest consistently, regardless of market conditions, but Bitcoin isn’t like most other assets. It has a well-documented **4-year cycle**, and ignoring this unique pattern felt like a missed opportunity.

For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle is largely driven by the halving events—where the reward miners receive for verifying transactions is cut in half, reducing Bitcoin’s supply inflation. Historically, this has led to a predictable pattern of market phases:

1. **Bull Run:** Prices rise rapidly after a halving, reaching all-time highs.
2. **Correction:** After the peak, the market corrects and enters a bearish phase.
3. **Accumulation:** Prices stabilize and consolidate at lower levels, setting the stage for the next cycle.

This cycle has repeated consistently since Bitcoin’s inception. So, while DCA works regardless of market conditions, it feels suboptimal to ignore these patterns when they’re so deeply ingrained in Bitcoin’s behavior.

That’s when I started thinking: *What if my investments could adapt to these market cycles?*

\----------------------------------------------------------------

# Dynamic DCA: A Smarter Approach

The key principle of Dynamic DCA is to invest the **same total amount of money** as traditional DCA over time, but by adjusting investments based on market conditions, achieve **greater returns in Bitcoin holdings**. For example: instead of investing a fixed **$100/month** like traditional DCA, I’d adjust my monthly investment dynamically between **$0 and $200**, depending on whether Bitcoin was overvalued or undervalued.

# The Challenge: Determining Market Value

My first attempt to identify overvalued or undervalued conditions was using Bitcoin’s **logarithmic power law model**.

The concept was straightforward:

* When Bitcoin’s price was **above the graph**, it was overvalued. The degree of overvaluation depended on how far the price was from the graph.
* When the price was **below the graph**, it was undervalued.

However, backtesting showed this approach performed no better than traditional DCA. It became clear I needed a more robust metric.

That’s when I found the [Crypto Bitcoin Bullish Index (CBBI)](https://colintalkscrypto.com/cbbi/). This index aggregates **9 different metrics**—including market sentiment, historical trends, and on-chain data—to determine whether Bitcoin is in a bullish or bearish phase. Importantly, **CBBI is open-sourced**, and I’m not promoting it—anyone can look into it if they’re curious. For example, if the CBBI is 81, I would invest $20. If the CBBI is 34, I would invest $124.

# Backtest Results

I tested Dynamic DCA against traditional DCA over different time ranges, but I want to show an example of one full Bitcoin cycle: **January 2019 to December 2022**.

Here’s what I found:

**Dynamic DCA Strategy:**

* **Total Invested:** $4,822.35
* **Total Bitcoin:** 0.51169072 BTC
* **Portfolio Value:** $8,782.12
* **ROI:** 82.11%
* **Average Buying Price:** $9,424.34

**Traditional DCA Strategy:**

* **Total Invested:** $4,800.00
* **Total Bitcoin:** 0.39902346 BTC
* **Portfolio Value:** $6,848.42
* **ROI:** 42.68%
* **Average Buying Price:** $12,029.37

**Strategy Comparison (in percentages):**

* **ROI Difference:** \+92.39%
* **BTC Balance Difference:** \+28.24%
* **Average Buying Price Difference:** \-21.66%

These results demonstrate how Dynamic DCA not only matches traditional DCA in total investment but also significantly outperforms it in Bitcoin accumulation and portfolio value, thanks to its market-aware adjustments.

# The Long-Term Nature of Dynamic DCA

This strategy works only over **a long timeframe**, ideally spanning at least one full Bitcoin cycle (approximately 4 years).

For instance, if someone starts investing during a **bull market**, they might end up with fewer Bitcoins than traditional DCA by the end of the bull phase. However, during the subsequent **bear market**, Dynamic DCA will invest more aggressively, taking advantage of lower prices. By the end of the bearish phase, the total money invested will match traditional DCA, but the amount of Bitcoin accumulated will be significantly higher.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

# Pushing Further: Trading for Bigger Gains

Encouraged by the results of Dynamic DCA, I started experimenting further. I asked myself: *What if I could also adjust my strategy to sell Bitcoin when it’s overvalued and buy it back when it’s undervalued?*

The idea builds on traditional DCA. As before, I put the **same amount of money into my account every month**, but instead of simply buying Bitcoin and holding it, this strategy dynamically converts between **Bitcoin and USDT** based on market conditions.

# The Core Strategy

1. **In bearish markets:** Hold funds in **USDT** to avoid losing value as Bitcoin prices decline.
2. **When the market turns bullish (CBBI hits \~15):** Use the accumulated USDT to **buy Bitcoin aggressively** over a few months.
   * After this aggressive buying phase, the strategy switches back to **DCA purchases**, steadily accumulating Bitcoin over time.
3. **At market highs (CBBI >90):** Aggressively convert Bitcoin back to USDT to lock in profits, preparing for the next cycle.

# The Results

Backtests over one Bitcoin cycle (**January 2019 to December 2022**) showed this approach could generate **\~140% more Bitcoin** than traditional DCA, while still using the same total investment. Here are the detailed results:

**Trading Strategy:**

* **Total Invested:** $4,865.13
* **Total Bitcoin:** 0.94048669 BTC
* **USDT Balance:** $0.00
* **Portfolio Value:** $15,620.67
* **ROI:** 221.07%
* **Average Buying Price:** $17,518.02
* **Average Selling Price:** $54,153.78

**Traditional DCA Strategy:**

* **Total Invested:** $4,865.13
* **Total Bitcoin:** 0.39151676 BTC
* **Portfolio Value:** $6,502.75
* **ROI:** 33.66%
* **Average Buying Price:** $12,426.36

**Strategy Comparison (in percentages):**

* **ROI Difference:** \+556.77%
* **BTC Balance Difference:** \+140.22%
* **Total Invested Difference:** 0.0%

# The Risk

The primary risk of this strategy lies in its **reliance on the CBBI**. The strategy’s success depends on CBBI accurately identifying market highs and lows. If the index misinterprets these turning points—for example, failing to recognize a peak during a bull market or a bottom during a bear market—the strategy’s performance could suffer.

While the backtests showed strong results, this reliance means the strategy’s effectiveness may vary if market conditions or the underlying metrics in CBBI change in the future. This is an important factor for any investor to consider.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

# Your Thoughts?

I’m sharing this because I’m curious to hear from others.

* **Does this approach make sense to you?**
* **Do you see any flaws in the logic or risks I might have overlooked?**
* **Have you tried something similar with your own investments?**

I’d love to discuss how these ideas could evolve or be improved—thanks for reading!

As I interpret this, the biggest cause of bitcoin rally these past few months is driven by ETFs and big institutions. A lot of this money is going to the market indirectly through hedge funds, this is a big difference compared to previous bull markets where people were engaged directly within CEXs and DEXs and retail played a much bigger role.

Why would we assume that alts would ever grow to their previous % shares or grow proportionately with BTC if the money flowing into BTC is there through ETFs.

I could only see that happening if altcoin ETFs were created thus creating a way of entering the market indirectly in a similar manner, but otherwise I would assume that retail is unable to pump enough money into the market to reach alt season of similar proportions compared to previous years.

In the current period, during Bitcoin's rise from $15,500 to $100,000, Altcoins have remained stagnant, much like they did before the 2021 rally.

Before the actual rise in the 2021 Bull Market, we remained stuck in the $19,800 region for 30 days. The belief that “old peaks cannot be surpassed, and sales should be made from these levels” was deeply ingrained.

In the current process, similarly, we’ve been stuck in the $69,000 region, the old peak from the 2021 Bull Market, for 240 days. The belief that “old peaks cannot be surpassed, and sales should be made from these levels” is again deeply ingrained.

After Bitcoin broke the $19,800 peak during the 2021 Bull Market, it surged to $42,000 in exactly 24 days.

During the rise from $19,800 to $42,000:

Bitcoin dominance increased from 60% to 73%. During this period, Bitcoin rose more than Altcoins. Although Altcoin prices didn’t drop in dollar terms, Altcoins’ Bitcoin pairs fell because Altcoins rose less than Bitcoin.

In Bitcoin’s rise from $3,150 to $42,000, Altcoins remained stagnant. Most Altcoins rose less than Bitcoin.

There was a correction from $42,000 to $29,000.

After Bitcoin’s 10x rise from $3,150 to $29,000, during its 2x rise from $29,000 to $65,000, Altcoins rose 50x to 100x in just 4 months, and the Altcoin Rally occurred in the last quarter of the Bull Market.

With this information in mind, I think we could see a correction or a zigzag-like sideways process in the upcoming period, but I believe this process will not last more than a month.

In the 2021 Bull Market, we saw a 30% drop from $42,000 to $29,000 in just 15 days. After the drop, the price rose again, breaking $42,000.

The important point is that during the rise after the correction, Altcoins rise much more than Bitcoin, and Bitcoin dominance drops while Bitcoin itself increases.

I believe the same process will happen after the correction in the current period. After the correction, once we break the $100,000 level, I expect Altcoins to rise much more compared to Bitcoin, seeing significant gains in Altcoin/BTC pairs, and Bitcoin dominance to drop to around 40%.

During the rise from $15,500 to $90,000, Altcoins remained stagnant. However, during Bitcoin’s rise from $90,000 to $140,000 - $150,000, I believe Altcoins will rise 50x to 100x. During this process, a new wave of investors, who will become the next victims of the upcoming Bear Market, will flood into the market.

I expect the Altcoin Rally to start by the end of 2024, and this cycle to end by the first quarter of 2025.

As for the potential correction or zigzag-like sideways process in the upcoming period, many may think that, since Bitcoin dropped by 30% from $42,000 to $29,000 in 2021, we will see a similar 30% drop from $100,000 to $60,000. However, this is a big mistake.

The most important thing to understand is that as the total amount of money in the cryptocurrency market increases, the volatility (the rate of rises and falls) decreases.

After each Bull Market, the rise rates in the next Bull are lower, and after every cycle, the rise and fall rates decrease. 

The rise rate in the 2011 Bull Market was never seen again, and the 93% drop in the 2012 Bear Market was also never repeated in any other Bear Market.

Additionally, today’s Bitcoin is the strongest Bitcoin in history.

Looking at the rise before the 2017 Bull Market, Bitcoin saw a drop of around 50%, and Altcoins dropped 70%.

Looking at the rise before the 2021 Bull Market, Bitcoin dropped more than 50% from $14,000 to $6,000, and Altcoins dropped 70%.

In the current Bull Market, Bitcoin held strong. It made a small correction, but Altcoins dropped 70%, just like in the past.

Additionally, for the first time in Bitcoin’s history, the old peak was surpassed before the Halving.

With the approval of ETFs and Bitcoin now seen as a reliable investment vehicle, we can confidently say that we have the strongest Bitcoin ever.

Therefore, I personally do not expect a 30% correction like in 2021. Instead, I think we may see a small correction or a zigzag-like sideways process.

Regarding the strategy I will implement in the upcoming period and my suggestions to you:

The only way not to miss the Altcoin Rally is to hold without making any buy-sell decisions when Bitcoin dominance is at its peak and the Altcoin rally is close. In the current period, I personally am holding without making any buy-sell decisions, patiently waiting for the Altcoin Rally.

I will not be thinking about selling and reducing my holdings just because a small drop might occur. I will continue to hold my Altcoins patiently.

The levels where I will sell all my coins are:

- Bitcoin dominance: 40%
- DXY: 90
- USDT dominance: 2-3%

For me, the buy-sell period is over. When the time comes to sell, I will be transparent about it and explain how the Bear Market will start and continue based on past cycles. If we do not sell, I will explain how our money will devalue.

During the most euphoric days of the Bull Market, when Altcoins rise significantly, and everyone is talking about how easy it is to get rich, I know I will get a lot of reactions from new investors. I will share my warnings and analyses repeatedly, without caring about the reactions, while being considerate of those who react.

When you look at my analysis, you will see that I often express my personal thoughts, saying things like ""if this happens, then that could happen based on the past."" There is no certainty, but one thing I am absolutely sure of in the cryptocurrency market:

That is, an Altcoin Rally like the one from January 2021 to May 2021 is bound to happen in the future.

Altcoins are Ponzi schemes.

In a Ponzi scheme, the first investors are paid in order to sustain the system. Without paying the first investors, the system cannot continue. These first investors bring in new investors, and ultimately, the first ones win, while the last ones lose.

The scenario in Altcoins is exactly the same.

The engine of the cryptocurrency market is new investors entering the market. For this engine to keep running, new investors must keep coming in.

The best way to attract new investors is through Altcoins. During the most euphoric days of the Bull Market, people don’t come in because Bitcoin rose from $15,500 to $150,000 in 2 years. They come in because they hear about Altcoins that have risen 100x in just 2 months.

New investors will come in because they hear about Altcoins that have increased by 50x or 100x in a short period. They will think, ""These people are getting rich quickly, I can do it too,"" without knowing the struggles during the 3-year Bear Market.

Therefore, during the euphoric days of the Bull Market, Altcoins that rise 50x or 100x are used as marketing tools to attract new investors and create buyers for otherwise worthless Altcoins.

In the cryptocurrency market, we small investors do not make the market rise or fall by buying or selling. When the market rises, it’s because we are all buying, and when the market falls, it’s because we are all selling. But during the Bull Market peak, the Altcoin prices will drop 95%, and at the most bloody days of the Bear Market, the rise will begin.

The Altcoin Rally that will happen in the next few years, after the most euphoric days of the Bull Market, will be a time when many investors will miss the peak and fall into the trap.

After surviving a 3-year Bear Market, we, the few who managed to stay afloat, are about to reap the rewards in the upcoming Altcoin Rally, which will last just a few months.

In the final days leading up to the Altcoin Rally, don’t fall into the trap of thinking, ""I’ll sell here for a 10-20% drop and buy back later to increase my quantity."" If we sell and the Altcoin Rally starts after, we’ll fall into the trap of thinking, ""I won’t buy back until it reaches the price I sold at,"" and we’ll miss the rally.

Don’t let small strategies make you a victim. 

Those who say ""this Bull Market is fake"" or ""this will drop"" are the ones who can’t accept missing out on the Bull Market, and you shouldn’t listen to them.

The Bull Market happens once every 4 years, and the Altcoin Rally lasts only 4 months. Don’t miss this opportunity.

In a world where people work 40 years to retire, the cryptocurrency market represents one of the greatest opportunities of our time. Don’t miss it.

The days when we will get the rewards for surviving the 3-year Bear Market are coming.

1i80o26,Shorting High Supply Inflation Cryptos,Lost-Attention-6419,3,14,2025-01-23 10:45:11,"Lately, I’ve been using a strategy that I think is worth sharing with the community. It revolves around **shorting cryptocurrencies with high supply inflation** while leveraging **funding rates** to generate additional income. Let me break it down and hear your thoughts on whether this is a solid approach.

# Why target high supply inflation cryptos?

Cryptos with high supply inflation continuously produce new tokens, which increases sell pressure in the market. This can lead to gradual price declines, especially if demand doesn’t keep up with the growing supply. Examples include staking tokens or coins with aggressive emission schedules.

# How do I execute the strategy?

1. **Open a planned short position**: I bet on the price going down by opening a short position.
2. **Use DCA in my short**: Instead of entering all at once, I scale into my short position gradually over time. This helps me keep my liquidation price higher, reducing the risk of being liquidated in case of a temporary pump.
3. **Take advantage of funding rates**: In perpetual futures markets, when there are more traders bullish (long) than bearish (short), longs pay shorts through funding rates. While holding my short position, I collect these funding fees, which adds an extra income stream alongside the potential profit from price drops.

# Benefits of this approach:

* **Natural sell pressure**: The increasing supply of these tokens already pushes prices downward.
* **Better risk management**: Using DCA allows me to adjust my position without relying on perfect entry timing.
* **Passive income via funding rates**: Even if the price takes time to drop, funding rates provide a steady stream of returns.

# Things to keep in mind:

* **Pick the right coins**: It’s essential to target projects with high supply inflation and weak demand or fundamentals.
* **Watch out for temporary pumps**: There’s always the risk of speculative price spikes, so keeping a high liquidation price is crucial.

What do you think of this strategy? Does it seem like a solid approach, or are there risks I might be overlooking? I’d love to hear your opinions or any suggestions for improvement!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i80o26/shorting_high_supply_inflation_cryptos/,3,0,0,,positive

1i89hml,Altcoin rally dynamics and 'willpower',Fit_Significance_549,1,1,2025-01-23 17:59:04,"Generally, coins seem like a gamble for new investors, promising a 100x return in just a few days. News stories that surface daily create new millionaires. (The big-money success stories you see on platforms like X are often orchestrated to drive your greed.) But what about the stories of the losers? During altcoin rallies, many people buy coins, make some profits, boast about it to their friends, then fall into the trap and lose everything. No one talks about the ones who give up and lose their money. The losers retreat into silence, going into depression, or in a final desperate attempt, they keep averaging down with their remaining funds. The outcome is always destruction. Millions of people who bought altcoins with great hope in 2021 shared a similar fate. These new investors were drawn in by the lure of huge X returns and ended up losing. Now, the cycle is about to create new victims in the 2025 rally, which is how the system operates. Otherwise, the entire altcoin ecosystem will collapse and will never find investors again. At this point, the most important thing to keep in mind is not to say ""I’ve solved this market"" or ""I’m great"" or ""I’ll make even more money."" Instead, we need to be aware that we are on the brink of falling into the trap set by the market makers who are pushing this feeling. Don’t believe in the false paradise created by rapidly rising coins and the daily news of great coins; soon, this rise will reverse, and you’ll be surrounded by the dreams that were sold to you. To avoid this, set your goals now, and when the market is at its most euphoric, and new investors are pouring in, sell your coins and convince yourself to withdraw your funds from the exchanges. In this process, the key word we need to understand is ""willpower."" It may seem easy to hold on without selling during the rally, but when the rally is over, staying grounded and selling all your coins without getting carried away by the dream requires true willpower.

Key highlights of the executive order include:

1. Protection and Promotion of Blockchain Networks: The order emphasizes safeguarding public blockchain networks and encourages the development of dollar-backed stablecoins.

2. Prohibition of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): It explicitly bans the creation and use of CBDCs within the United States, reflecting the administration's stance against centralized digital currencies.

3. Revocation of Previous Crypto Regulations: The order nullifies prior directives that were perceived as hindrances to the crypto industry's growth, aiming to reduce regulatory burdens and foster innovation.

This initiative aligns with President Trump's broader vision to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet.""

1i8yu0o,Are We Already at the End of Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle? 🧐,Lost-Attention-6419,1,0,2025-01-24 16:05:47,"To me, it seems evident that we’re nearing the end of Bitcoin’s bull cycle. Sure, there might still be room for a small push upward, but looking at historical patterns, I believe we’re close to the top.   
Here’s my reasoning:  
  
**Time since the last bear market:**  
It’s been quite a while since Bitcoin exited the last bear market, and the current price behavior shows similarities to the final stages of the 2021 cycle. Based on historical trends, we’re approaching a timeframe that aligns with previous cycle peaks.  
  
**Less volatility this cycle:**  
This cycle seems less explosive compared to previous ones, likely due to the market’s maturity and the increasing presence of institutional investors. I speculate that in the next bear market, we might see solid supports between $35k and $45k, representing a 55%-65% drop from the peak. This aligns with the trend of higher lows in bear markets over time.  
  
**The FOMO is gone:**  
We’ve already experienced the hype at the start of this cycle, with news such as the U.S. elections and Bitcoin spot ETFs. However, the market now seems to be losing some of that excitement. While Q1 may remain relatively flat, I believe Q2 could bring higher volatility and potentially mark the end of this bull market.  
  
**What to expect now?**  
While another upward move is possible, I no longer believe this cycle will be as explosive as previous ones. The market seems to be consolidating in a more sustainable way, which might mean fewer extreme peaks and less dramatic drops.  


Do you think we’re truly at the end of the bull cycle, or does Bitcoin still have room to hit new highs?  
Does this cycle feel less volatile to you, or is it just a pause before another big move?  
What are your predictions for the bottom of the next bear market?

1i9c777,The Dragonchain Dilemma: A Crucial Case in the Crypto Ecosystem,dj_elkins,3,0,2025-01-25 01:51:52,"The @Dragonchain Dilemma: A Crucial Case in the Crypto Ecosystem

Dragonchain, born out of @Disney tech innovation, has been at the forefront of blockchain technology with its focus on compliance, security, and interoperability. Despite its American roots and innovative approach, Dragonchain has found itself ensnared in a long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This case has become emblematic of the broader regulatory challenges facing the cryptocurrency sector in the US.

Regulatory Pressure and Legacy Approaches

The @SECGov case against Dragonchain, which has been ongoing for nearly seven years, centers around the classification of its $DRGN token. The dispute highlights the tension between traditional securities law and the novel aspects of blockchain technology. While the token was intended to be a utility token for Dragonchain's services, the SEC has pursued it under the premise that it could be classified as a security. This regulatory action has significantly impacted Dragonchain's ability to operate and expand, showcasing how regulatory ambiguity can stifle innovation in the crypto space.

Under the previous administration, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was known for his stringent approach to crypto regulation, often seen as an ""enemy"" of the industry's growth. This mindset has seemingly trickled down to some lawyers within the SEC who continue to pursue cases in a manner reminiscent of Gensler's tenure. This persistence in old regulatory paradigms, despite the clear shift in policy direction under @POTUS Donald Trump, has caused friction and slowed down the momentum towards making the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world.""

New Leadership, New Hope

With Trump's administration, there's been a marked shift in crypto policy, aiming to foster innovation and clarify regulations to support the burgeoning digital asset economy. @MarkUyedaUS and @HesterPeirce, both SEC Commissioners known for their more crypto-friendly stances, have been pivotal in this transition. Uyeda, now acting as SEC Chair, alongside Peirce, have launched a crypto task force to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework that could redefine how digital assets are treated under U.S. law. This task force aims to collaborate with industry participants, investors, and the public to create a regulatory environment that not only protects but also encourages innovation.

The Importance of Resolving Dragonchain's Case

The ongoing legal battle with Dragonchain is more than just a single dispute; it's a litmus test for how the U.S. intends to handle crypto regulation moving forward. Resolving this case could set a precedent for how utility tokens are viewed and regulated, potentially providing much-needed clarity to countless other projects in similar predicaments. Holding up such cases directly contradicts the current administration's push to make the U.S. an attractive hub for blockchain technology. 

The case's resolution could also signal to the global market that the U.S. is serious about becoming a leader in the crypto sector, not just through rhetoric but through action. This is crucial at a time when other jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland, and the EU are actively working on or already implementing clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. 

Conclusion

The Dragonchain case underscores the urgent need for regulatory evolution in the U.S. crypto landscape. While there's evident pressure from the current administration to embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency, the persistence of ""Gensler-era"" enforcement strategies by some within the SEC suggests a lag in adapting to this new vision. Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce represent hope for change, and their leadership could be key in aligning the SEC's actions with Trump's vision of turning the U.S. into the world's crypto capital. Only by resolving such pivotal cases can the U.S. truly foster a dynamic, innovative, and globally competitive crypto ecosystem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i9c777/the_dragonchain_dilemma_a_crucial_case_in_the/,3,0,0,,positive

1i9kkhu,BTC Price May Be at Risk Amid Trump Team Crypto Scandal and Proposed Bitcoin Bill,SventuraOscura,1,0,2025-01-25 10:56:01,"The crypto world has been hit with shocking allegations involving former President Donald Trump and his team, leaving Bitcoin (BTC) investors on edge. While Bitcoin's price remains relatively stable for now, the potential for a dramatic market shift looms large as rumors swirl about a scandal and a new Bitcoin-related federal proposal. Here's the full story.

# Trump’s Alleged Crypto Scandal

Over the past few months, reports have surfaced alleging that members of Trump’s inner circle were involved in a cryptocurrency project that misled investors. The project, marketed as a groundbreaking investment, leveraged Trump’s influence and political clout to pump its value. But now, accusations are flying that the project was nothing more than a pump-and-dump scheme, with insiders selling off their holdings as the coin’s price peaked, leaving everyday investors holding the bag.

Blockchain analysts and whistleblowers claim to have traced some of the profits to Trump-affiliated entities, although no formal charges have been filed. Trump himself has yet to address these allegations directly, but his legal team has dismissed the claims as “politically motivated nonsense.”

# The Bitcoin Bill Proposal: A Strategic Play?

Amid the controversy, Trump made waves this week by proposing a new federal Bitcoin initiative. His bill calls for the U.S. government to begin acquiring Bitcoin as a “safe haven asset” to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The proposal positions BTC as an essential component of America’s financial future.

Here’s where things get interesting: some analysts believe the bill’s timing could be part of a broader strategy. While Bitcoin prices are currently stable, rumors of market manipulation are rampant. Critics argue that Trump and his allies may have plans to drive Bitcoin’s price lower in the coming days, potentially through coordinated sell-offs or other tactics, making it easier for large players—or even the government—to accumulate Bitcoin at a discount.

The crypto community is speculating whether this proposal is a genuine attempt to adopt Bitcoin or a calculated move to benefit those in Trump’s orbit.

# The Calm Before the Storm?

For now, the BTC market hasn’t reacted strongly to the news, but many investors are bracing for potential turbulence. “The allegations are serious, and if Trump’s team is involved in anything shady, it could shake investor confidence,” one Reddit user posted on r/cryptocurrency. “Even if the bill has good intentions, it might spook the market.”

Others see an opportunity amid the chaos. “If the government starts buying Bitcoin, it’s a long-term bullish signal, even if prices dip in the short term,” another user argued.

# What’s Next?

While Bitcoin remains stable for now, the situation is fluid, and a significant market shift could occur if the allegations against Trump’s team gain traction—or if large-scale sell-offs occur. The crypto market has weathered its share of scandals, but the combination of political drama and regulatory uncertainty could make this situation uniquely volatile.

As the story develops, crypto enthusiasts and investors alike are left wondering: is this a genuine push for Bitcoin adoption, or are we witnessing another example of high-level market manipulation?

1i9t2n5,Are you on the Hype train?,ma6ic,2,1,2025-01-25 18:12:17,"I haven't seen much posted about DeFi or Hyperliquid in this sub, so hoping this reaches some new eyes. There are returns on stablecoin yield that blow traditional finance out of the water. 

Hyperliquid is a spot and perpetuals exchange that lets any user deposit USDC into their market maker and earn APR based on user demand. It's been 27% for the last month and reaches 30% regularly. It ranges between 20-30% mostly.

That is crazy value for stablecoin yield and there is only a 4-day lockup after each deposit, so the unstaking is pretty liquid.

There's a lot of great coin recommendations in the this sub, but I've seen very little on HYPE, which is a massive opportunity. It's a newer coin with a rabid userbase who is mostly just not on Reddit. Here's a little background on Hyperliquid just for context.

Hyperliquid really made a name for itself in 2024 with what was basically the biggest airdrop of all time—over $10 billion worth of tokens dropped directly to the community. From day one, it attracted a ton of users who tried it, loved it, and ended up building an insanely tight-knit community. People even created supporting products like HypurrFun, pvp.trade, and HypurrScan to build around it.

At the core, Hyperliquid’s tech just *worked* as a good perp DEX should:

* It handled high trading volumes even when the markets were all over the place.
* Spreads were tight, and the liquidity for alts was better than most.
* Just overall, it was smooth and profitable to trade there compared to other platforms.

But what made it stand out was how creative it got:

* Vaults let regular users step into roles like market makers or liquidators (normally reserved for big players).
* Deposits didn’t just sit there—they earned yield and added to liquidity depth.
* A portion of liquidation fees went back into those vaults, which was a win for users.

They also introduced HLP, where users could benefit from both trading *and* contributing to the platform’s liquidity. It was designed to make everyone an active part of the ecosystem.

Oh, and let’s not forget that airdrop—310 million tokens (\~$10 billion in HYPE liquidity). It was on another level, to the point that it created this huge initial push for adoption.

The tokenomics? Super healthy. No VC allocations, no paid market makers. All the fees are reinvested back into the product to benefit users, which is pretty rare.

And this is just the beginning. Hyperliquid isn’t just a DEX—they’re building out an entire ecosystem with dApps on their HyperEVM, a high-performance chain with HyperBFT consensus that keeps everything familiar for developers.

Also, the way they’ve grown is wild. No VC funding. No big marketing campaigns. Everything has been completely community-driven. They basically bootstrapped their way into becoming one of the most talked-about platforms out there.

TLDR: Hyperliquid dropped a killer product that’s both profitable and fun to use, created an ecosystem where the community actually benefits, and kicked it all off with an insane airdrop that got everyone’s attention. Seems like they’re just getting started.

1ibiifp,Cryptos are shit,Ok_Educator_3569,0,3,2025-01-27 20:01:46,"**The story repeats itself, not in itself, but because the actors change, and these new actors have not had the chance to gain direct experience. They perceive the past as an end in itself and feel immune to making the same mistakes. However, the new situations that lead us to repeat past mistakes do not occur in the same ways or through the exact circumstances that caused previous errors. Instead, they change: the actors change, the dynamics change, and, above all, the circumstances change. Yet we humans do not change much. The technology around us evolves quickly, but the way we are built and our way of acting remain the same.**

I don't know if you've seen the movie *The Big Short*; if you haven't and you're interested in the world of cryptocurrencies, you should watch it. In my opinion, it's a film that explains to most people what the world of crypto truly is—a big nonsense. It's garbage disguised as innovation. It's a world that leverages our economic struggles and our desire for financial independence and freedom from the system as a whole.

Most of those who support cryptocurrencies are people without a university education or with a university education far removed from economics. Many of these crypto supporters, Bitcoin advocates first and foremost, have no idea how the current economic system works, yet they want to overturn it. It's like wanting to change the rules of soccer without even knowing the basics of the game.

The frustration of not being able to understand an economic system as intricate as ours leads people to think the solution is a simple and basic idea like Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin supporters, when asked what it is and what it's for, always answer with the same rhetoric: its value is mathematical, it's limited, it's decentralized... without even knowing what these terms mean.

These people hate banks without even knowing how they work. Banks are companies, and they don’t give away anything for free, just like any other company. At times, they may seem a bit sneaky, but that's probably because the subject matter is outside your expertise. Understanding economic dynamics comes from study, just like any other field, and it takes years and years of study to grasp these topics.

What’s being sold with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is the simplicity of understanding things. Everything is marketed as easy, fast, intuitive. That’s why the baker (sorry, I have nothing against practical professions) who knows nothing about micro, macro, and economics in general can claim that Bitcoin is the best thing ever.

And the exorbitant price growth continues to fuel these claims among all Bitcoin and crypto supporters. But if you had a basic understanding of economics, you’d realize on your own that this doesn’t make any sense: the price growth of cryptocurrencies is driven by self-fulfilling expectations (at least for now) and nothing else. There is no underlying activity to justify these prices.

Let me give you a simple example: take a generic company where any of you could work. Let’s say it has 20 employees, generates €1.5 million in annual revenue, and makes a profit of €100,000 a year. Based on these data and by evaluating some of these aspects, I can estimate that this company is worth €2 million (capitalization). This capitalization is likely justified because there’s an underlying business that sells and makes a profit.

In the crypto world, it’s not like that. A Bitcoin is worth 100k not because it has real economic justification but simply because our self-fulfilling expectations have driven it there.

Now you’ll ask, “But why do large funds and major institutions invest in it?” Some are smart and make strategic moves; others are simply human like all of us. Remember, we are always human beings, and our behavior in society is somewhat like that of sheep.

As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has become a vital asset for individuals, institutions, and even governments. Major corporations are starting to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset, recognizing its value as a hedge against inflation and its potential as digital gold. Crypto adoption is accelerating globally, with America even discussing creating a “crypto hub city.” This signals a shift in the mainstream view of cryptocurrencies as a cornerstone of future financial systems. Countries that fail to adapt to the growing crypto market risk falling behind economically, as massive capital is poised to flow into the space over the coming years. Bitcoin’s growing integration into the financial world ensures its long-term survival and relevance.

1ibx1l1,Stablecoins: The Future of Digital Currency or a Risky Bet?,gzebe,1,2,2025-01-28 08:25:45,"In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins have emerged as a bridge between the volatile crypto market and the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Designed to maintain a stable value, stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular for payments, trading, and decentralized finance (DeFi). But what exactly are stablecoins, how do they work, and are they safe? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about stablecoins, their benefits, risks, and how they’re shaping the future of finance.
What Are Stablecoins?
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or basket of assets. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are known for their price volatility, stablecoins are pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies (e.g., USD, EUR), commodities (e.g., gold), or even other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, savings, and hedging against market fluctuations.
Types of Stablecoins
Stablecoins can be categorized based on their underlying collateral or mechanism for maintaining stability:
1. Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins
Backed by reserves of fiat currency held in bank accounts.
Each stablecoin is typically pegged 1:1 to the fiat currency.
Examples: USDT (Tether), USDC (USD Coin), BUSD (Binance USD).
2. Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins
Backed by other cryptocurrencies, often held in smart contracts.
Over-collateralized to account for crypto volatility.
Examples: DAI, sUSD (Synthetix USD).
3. Commodity-Collateralized Stablecoins
Backed by physical assets like gold or silver.
Examples: PAX Gold (PAXG), Tether Gold (XAUT).
4. Algorithmic Stablecoins
Use algorithms and smart contracts to control supply and maintain the peg.
Examples: FRAX (note: UST (TerraUSD) collapsed in 2022 due to algorithmic failure).
Why Are Stablecoins Important?
Stablecoins offer several key benefits that make them valuable in the crypto ecosystem and beyond:
Price Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide a predictable store of value.
Fast and Low-Cost Transactions: Ideal for cross-border payments and remittances.
DeFi Integration: Stablecoins are a cornerstone of decentralized finance, enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming.
Hedging Against Volatility: Traders use stablecoins to protect their portfolios during market downturns.
Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins provide access to digital financial services for the unbanked and underbanked.
How to Make a Stablecoin Safe
Creating a safe stablecoin requires careful design, transparency, and risk management. Here are the key steps:
1. Choose the Right Collateral Mechanism
Use high-quality, diversified collateral (e.g., fiat, crypto, commodities).
Ensure over-collateralization for crypto-backed stablecoins.
2. Ensure Transparency and Regular Audits
Publish proof-of-reserves reports.
Engage third-party auditors to verify collateral.
3. Implement Strong Governance
Use decentralized governance (e.g., DAOs) or centralized oversight with accountability.
4. Comply with Regulations
Obtain necessary licenses and follow AML/KYC requirements.
5. Manage Risks
Diversify collateral and conduct stress tests.
Insure reserves against theft or loss.
6. Secure Smart Contracts
Audit code regularly and offer bug bounties.
Ensure upgradeability with safeguards.
7. Maintain Liquidity
Partner with exchanges and DeFi platforms to ensure liquidity.
8. Plan for Black Swan Events
Implement emergency mechanisms and redemption options.
Risks and Challenges
While stablecoins offer many benefits, they are not without risks:
Centralization Risk: Many stablecoins are issued by centralized entities, which could fail or face regulatory scrutiny.
Collateral Devaluation: If the backing assets lose value, the stablecoin could lose its peg.
Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments are still figuring out how to regulate stablecoins, which could impact their use.
Algorithmic Failures: Algorithmic stablecoins can fail under extreme market conditions (e.g., UST collapse).
Transparency Issues: Some stablecoins have faced criticism for lack of transparency (e.g., Tether’s early controversies).
Popular Stablecoins in 2023
Here are some of the most widely used stablecoins today:
USDT (Tether): The largest stablecoin by market cap, widely used in trading and remittances.
USDC (USD Coin): Known for its transparency and regulatory compliance.
DAI: A decentralized stablecoin backed by crypto collateral, popular in DeFi.
BUSD (Binance USD): Issued by Binance, widely used on the Binance exchange and in DeFi.
PAX Gold (PAXG): Backed by physical gold, offering a stable store of value.
The Future of Stablecoins
Stablecoins are poised to play a significant role in the future of finance. They are already revolutionizing cross-border payments, DeFi, and financial inclusion. However, their success will depend on:
Regulatory Clarity: Governments need to establish clear rules for stablecoins.
Technological Innovation: Advances in blockchain and smart contract technology will enhance stability and security.
User Trust: Transparency, audits, and strong governance will be critical for building trust.
Conclusion
Stablecoins represent a powerful innovation in the world of digital finance, offering stability, speed, and accessibility. However, their safety and success depend on robust design, transparency, and regulatory compliance. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, stablecoins are likely to become an integral part of the global financial system—provided they can navigate the challenges ahead.
Whether you’re a trader, investor, or simply curious about the future of money, stablecoins are worth keeping an eye on. They may just be the key to unlocking a more stable and inclusive financial future.

1icr6f5,Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev calls on the SEC to update investor rules and allow equity tokenization for startups.,redditdotcrypto,0,0,2025-01-29 10:53:36,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has called for the U.S. to modernize its investment regulations to enable startups to tokenize their equity. In an opinion piece published in *The Washington Post* on Tuesday, Tenev argued that the current ""accredited investor"" rules are overly restrictive, preventing ordinary investors from accessing private markets.

According to *The Block*, Tenev proposed several key measures for the SEC to adopt:

* Replacing the wealth-based ""accredited investor"" criteria with a self-certification system
* Establishing a registration framework for security tokens
* Creating clear token listing guidelines for U.S. brokers and exchanges

His article comes as the Trump administration launches a cryptocurrency working group, led by acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda, to develop a new regulatory framework. This marks a sharp contrast to the Biden administration's stricter approach under Gary Gensler.

1icsxbw,"A Clear Perspective on Spot Investments in Bitcoin and Altcoins, and Investor Psychology in Market Cycles",Fit_Significance_549,19,6,2025-01-29 12:44:42,"The market cycle and investor psychology give us a transparent and clear understanding of where we stand in Bitcoin and altcoin spot investments.  

During the 2017 bull season, after altcoins had surged 50x to 100x, most investors firmly believed in the crypto sector’s immense potential and saw no reason for a market drop. They patiently held onto their investments.  

At the beginning of the 2018 bear season, every dip was perceived as a buying opportunity. Investors kept buying as prices fell further. Many justified holding onto losses of 40%–50% by saying, ""We're only losing from our profits; it will rise again, so we shouldn't sell now."" 

However, during the early stages of the bear market, the cycle deceived even those who had sold at the right time by making them believe that it was a new buying opportunity, pulling them back into the swamp of losses.  

By 2019, when Bitcoin hit its bear market bottom at $3,150, many altcoins were delisted from exchanges and vanished entirely. The remaining ones had plummeted by up to 95%, turning most investors' funds into dust.  

Similarly, during Bitcoin's drop to $15,500 in 2022, people started waiting for $9,000, just as they had previously expected a return to the 2013 bull peak of $1,200.  

During the 2019 bear market, spot investors were seen as fools. The most popular argument at the time was:  

""With leveraged trading now available, we will never again see 50x-100x gains on altcoins like in 2017. We will never experience another altcoin rally.""

However, the 2021 bull market completely disproved this argument, with tokens like MATIC, LINK, HOT, WRX, and CHZ surging 100x, and LEND, FTM, DOGE reaching 1,000x gains.  

 The Psychological Setup Before an Altcoin Rally  

During the 2019 bear market relief rally, Bitcoin climbed from $3,150 to $14,000, then dropped back to $6,000. At this point, altcoins lost all of their previous gains and even created new lows.  

This set the perfect **psychological stage** for an altcoin rally.  

By this time, the perception of spot investment had changed from being seen as dumb and naive to an understanding that trading was the only viable strategy. Even those who had believed in holding spot investments gave up and switched to short-term trades when their portfolios were down 70% during the relief rally's crash phase.  

In August 2020, we experienced a mini altcoin relief rally similar to today's market cycle.  

Bitcoin topped at $12,500, then corrected only 20% to $10,000 over three months. However, during this period, altcoins sharply dropped by 50%–70% despite Bitcoin’s relatively minor decline.  

The 2024 market cycle resembles this period, but with a crucial difference:  

- Normally, a longer correction phase results in shallower losses, while a shorter one leads to more drastic drops.  
- However, we experienced both an extended correction phase and harsh 70%–80% drawdowns, marking a historical anomaly.  

This prolonged downturn has now perfectly recreated** the psychological environment necessary before an altcoin rally.  

The Emotional Shift Before the Next Major Bull Run  

Throughout October 2023 – March 2024, we experienced a relief rally, and optimism was high.  

During this period:  

- Everyone held onto their investments, believing a bull run was imminent.  
- Investors were happy and convinced altcoins would soon skyrocket.  

However, as the altcoin market crashed by 70%–80% afterward, it successfully instilled the fear and disbelief necessary for an altcoin rally to begin.  

In March 2024, when altcoins return to previous high levels, market sentiment will be drastically different:  

- Instead of excitement, investors will fear another crash.  
- Many will sell early out of paranoia, becoming day traders instead.  
- As altcoins continue rising, former bagholders will think:  
  *""I sold here; I won’t buy again until prices drop to where I sold."" 
- This psychology will make holding through gains the hardest it has ever been.  

By the peak of the next bull run, long-term spot investors who endured the pain will celebrate victory, while short-term traders will be left with deep regrets.  

New investors entering in 2025 will see that the biggest winners are long-term spot holders, convincing them to become long-term investors too—just in time for the next market collapse in 2026–2028.  

My Personal Strategy  

- When Bitcoin was $17,000, I predicted Bitcoin dominance would rise alongside BTC's price.  
- I switched entirely to Bitcoin, expecting it to outperform altcoins.  
- As Bitcoin hit $60,000 (a 4x gain), I converted everything into altcoins in May 2024.  

At this point, I no longer trade. Instead, I patiently hold my portfolio until specific market conditions signal it’s time to sell:  

 My Selling Criteria:  

1. DXY at 90 (Dollar weakening)  
2. Bitcoin dominance at 40% (Money flowing into altcoins)  
3. USDT dominance at 2%–3% (Retail speculation peaking)  

I will sell everything at once unless some of my coins already surge 10x–20x before that point.  

Even though altcoins may double or triple afterward, I won’t take the risk of getting caught in the next bear market. I will withdraw all my funds from exchanges to avoid temptation.  

When I sell, I will publicly announce my exit, detailing:  

- The potential upcoming bear season
- How the bear market will unfold 
- How our portfolios would shrink dramatically if we don’t exit in time 

By that time, new investors will flood in, and the market will be euphoric. The news cycle will be overwhelmingly bullish, and people will believe there’s no reason for prices to drop—just as it always happens at the top.  

However, my goal is not to engage in arguments but to warn people calmly and consistently—even if I receive backlash from newcomers.

1idezaz,Elon Musk’s X Wallet gets Visa support – Impact on digital payments?,coinfanking,0,11,2025-01-30 04:58:00,"Elon Musk’s X partners with Visa, fueling speculation about crypto integration. Could Bitcoin and Dogecoin become part of X Money’s future?




Linda Yaccarino weighs in
Remarking on the same, Yaccarino took to X and noted, 

“Another milestone for the Everything App: @Visa is our first partner for the @XMoney Account, which will debut later this year.”

The CEO explained that users can securely and instantly fund their X Wallet using Visa Direct, connected to their debit card.

This enables peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, allowing direct fund transfers to other users.

Additionally, users can instantly transfer funds from their X Wallet back to their bank account. This provides greater flexibility in managing and moving funds between their digital wallet and traditional bank accounts.

This integration enhances the convenience of digital payments while ensuring security and speed.

She added, 

“First of many big announcements about X Money this year. LFG.”

Is this good news for crypto?
Needless to say, Musk’s latest initiative to enhance the X Wallet aligns with his broader vision of developing a super app similar to China’s WeChat.

With Musk’s close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump, a notable supporter of cryptocurrency, there is growing speculation that the X Wallet may eventually expand to support digital assets like Bitcoin [BTC].

If realized, it could pave the way for deeper integration of crypto within mainstream financial services.

As expected, this news was also well received by the crypto community as highlighted by Global Index which noted, 

“As Elon said: X will be the everything app.” 

Adding to the fray was an X user who said, 

“I can’t wait!” 

Musk’s new role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and his plans to incorporate blockchain technology into federal operations could provide a significant boost to crypto adoption in digital payments.

Btc grew over the last 365 days while alts barely.

Maybe all the ""alt money"" went to etfs, btc, meme coins instead? Maybe people are getting burned out? Crypt used to be a smaller community. It's more mainstream than ever that governments are accumulating. It started with btc, went into other areas.. maybe it'll go back to mainly btc. 

  
The elites control the narrative now. Governments, billionaires. They're gonna control btc, it's supply. they'll say what's value and what isn't. And the people won't have much of a say. This cycle has been a great learning process. When I wanna screenshot my portfolio, I need to sell. When I see the elderly talk about crypto, I need to sell.

1ifn12s,Bull case for Monero,OptimalLifeStrategy,1,1,2025-02-02 02:27:58,"Currently the majority of people holding Monero actually use it rather than for investing purposes like the other coins. Everyone knows the governments and media are suppressing it as well.

Money laundering makes up 2.5-5% of the global gdp \[1\]. The big three methods for money laundering is cash, gold, and crypto. Currently the majority of the money is mostly moving through USD cash \[2\].

However, there is a big coming problem for money laundering. Cash use is declining heavily year over year in 2015 it made up 30% of transactions and now in 2025 it makes up 15% \[3\]. This is projected to drop even further to <5% in the 2030's.

Governments would love to get rid of cash as it makes surveillance so much easier. China is already much further ahead at removing cash and I expect the US to catch up in the 2030's.

The money launders will need to find a new primary method and as it stands now the choice will likely either be gold or crypto. I think gold will also see an increase in value do to this, but it obviously has physical limitations unlike crypto.

Out of all the cryptocurrencies Monero is by far the best privacy coin currently. If it maintains its top status as a privacy coin (which it has done for a decade already) I expect to see a huge volume of money to flow in skyrocketing the price.

Their main concerns are that retail FOMO is off the charts. Random coins are skyrocketing overnight with no real use case. There’s also a lot of regulatory uncertainty. The US is warming up to crypto, but that could change fast. And then there’s the market volatility. Bitcoin just dropped below 100K after a crazy run, and some are worried about what’s next.

But is this really a bubble or just crypto being crypto? Some argue this time is different with more institutional adoption and real-world use cases than in past cycles.

To be honest, I didn’t even care at all when the price was dipping. My portfolio was down $15k in 1 day, wishing I had more fiat to buy.

I looked on this Sub during the weekend and it was Madness. Doom and Gloom FUD posts  everywhere, constantly. I haven’t seen this much FUD since FTX had crashed, which actually had an effect on the market.

A Trade war will not change anything.

Do you guys not remember we had a Trade War going on during the LAST BULLRUN??

We had Tariffs up until Biden came into office, and the price of Bitcoin had hit an All Time High during that time period.

When the President announced a Trade War on Friday, the market “reacted” to this news by dipping during the weekend. *Or so we thought….*

Come to find out, prices pumped right back today, almost like it was all designed that way. Because it was….

Here’s where you need to ***Pay Attention:***

Whales, and now Wall Street, working in coordination to “pump and dump” cryptos. We all know this. But they also work in coordination to “Dump and Pump” the market. Here’s how they do this….

They leverage out large positions, and Short those positions. I have heard they can do this up to 50X leverage and even higher in some cases. Meaning they only need $1 Billion, at 50X leverage, to have the capability to Short the Market $50 Billion. It’s A drop in the bucket for some of these Whales, and again they are doing this in coordination. So this could be a large group of whales moving on the same coins, or the Market as a whole.

They are also doing this, and then running Ads or “articles” (as some people call them), plus sending droves of bots over to Reddit to post Negative Market sentiment. Look at a Loss Porn post, and notice they are mostly very new accounts with low karma.

Now, here’s how they make money: They take out these massive Short Positions and Sell the Market off, in hopes to create Fear in retail, who eventually Paper Hand and sell during the dip. They know that enough of this will happen, and create a panic sell or “bank run”, further capitulating the market. Then once all of the Selling Pressure is done, they buy the Positions back. The goal here is to buy the position back at a 10%+ discount, and keep the 10%+ as profit.

Now if you do this with $50 Billion, your profits would be $5 Billion on a $1 Billion investment. These whales just did a 5X while the Market Shriveled in Fear….

What’s interesting about this sell off, is it also started on Friday evening, ***After*** the Stock Market and Banks were done for the week, so nobody would be able to move that kind of money around. ***This was a Well Coordinated, and planned effort.***

The Vets like myself just cracked some beers and chuckled. But the newcomers were freaking out. ***USE THIS EXPERIENCE TO LEARN.***

Watch some videos of Jeff Yan the founder, and you'll see that with his actions and his words, he is in this for the longhaul. They airdropped the largest airdrop in History TO USERS, just for supporting their platform. While other founders would have long walked away with the cash. **Technical Performance** Visit the Dump we had on February 3rd and you'll see that of all altcoins, HYPE held the best into the dump. It barely moved an inch while ETH went down an entire 35% in 1 day. On top of this, it had a rally from when it was first   
dropped, from $0.50 to $45 in 3 days. Breaking top into the top 20 cryptocurrencies in just a few days.   
  
**Supply and Demand** Normies can't even buy this token yet. It's not listed on any major centralized exchanges and you'll need to essentially buy USDC, bridge to Arbitrum Network, and then deposit into their exchange just to buy it. It's all designed to maximize usage on HyperLiquid, which currently has the overwhelming lead for Decentralized Exchanges. There is nothing out there, that even closely matches the technology that HyperLiquid brings to the table in regards to providing a Decentralized Exchange where users can trade the same way they would on Binance, or Bybit.

**Tokenomics** The Tokenomics here are optimized as a FlyWheel. Jeff was a Harvard Grad that worked for Hudson River Trading right out of College. The top high frequency trading firm in the world. If the best HFT trading firm in the world, is paying this guy to write their scripts, what do you think he's able to do with creating optimized tokenomics for high price gain? **Competitors** We're looking at this being eventually bigger than a platform like Binance. Simply because, it rewards the users the most for using the platform, and doesn't profit off of them. All Spot fees go towards BUYING the token off the market, which increases the price of the token. It's BNB, but on crack, and designed in a way better fashion. They are also creating an L1, which I believe will operate more efficiently than any L1 that is currently out there. I do not doubt that guys that are this high level with development, cannot create something bigger than what is currently available to us (SOL, BNB, ETH, etc).

1ij2q50,Could Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Be the U.S. Government’s Most Unexpected Crypto Play?,night_crawlers,1,0,2025-02-06 13:38:20,"There’s been a lot of discussion lately about the U.S. forming a sovereign wealth fund, something usually associated with oil-rich nations, not America. While most assume it will be packed with traditional assets—gold, stocks, bonds, and maybe some Bitcoin—it’s worth considering a more unexpected possibility: Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

At first glance, this might seem like a long shot, but when you take a closer look at the incentives at play, it starts to make a lot more sense. Let’s break it down.

Trump and His Inner Circle Stand to Benefit

If there’s one thing we know about politicians, it’s that they rarely make decisions that don’t benefit themselves or their allies. Trump has already demonstrated an openness to crypto, and his campaign is accepting Bitcoin Cash donations. That’s a deliberate choice, not an accident.

If BCH were to be included in the fund, it could experience a massive price surge, making anyone holding a large amount of it significantly wealthier overnight. Given Trump’s history of backing plays that serve his personal interests, it wouldn’t be surprising if BCH’s potential for explosive gains made it an appealing asset for him and his network.

A Move That Would Create Maximum Disruption

Trump thrives on shaking things up. If the U.S. government were to adopt Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin, it would be one of the most controversial financial decisions in recent history. The Bitcoin maximalist community would go into full meltdown mode, Wall Street would scramble to react, and mainstream media would turn it into a nonstop talking point.

The sheer shock value alone would make BCH one of the most talked-about assets in the world. Whether people love it or hate it, it would instantly be cemented as a major player in the crypto space.

More Upside Than Bitcoin

Bitcoin is already a trillion-dollar asset, with widespread institutional adoption. If the U.S. government decided to buy in, it wouldn’t fundamentally change the trajectory of BTC.

Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, is still undervalued and has room for significant growth. A large-scale government purchase would push its market cap up dramatically, creating far greater profit potential than Bitcoin at its current valuation.

From a financial standpoint, if the goal is to maximize returns rather than just store value, BCH makes a stronger case than BTC.

Why Bitcoin Cash and Not Another Cryptocurrency?

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there, so why BCH? The answer comes down to a few key factors:

Recognizability & Branding – BCH still carries the “Bitcoin” name, which gives it instant credibility compared to other altcoins. If Trump or the U.S. government wanted to back a cryptocurrency, picking something with “Bitcoin” in the name makes it far more palatable to the general public.
Decentralization & Infrastructure – Unlike many other altcoins, BCH is widely traded on major exchanges, has a well-established network, and isn't controlled by a single company (like XRP or Solana).
Ideological Alignment – BCH markets itself as digital cash, free from central control, which aligns with anti-Fed, anti-bank, and pro-freedom narratives. If Trump wanted to back a cryptocurrency that fits his political messaging, BCH is a much better fit than Ethereum, which is seen as more centralized and Wall Street-friendly.

The Political and Ideological Play

Bitcoin Cash has always positioned itself as closer to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision—a true peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It has been largely dismissed by Bitcoin’s core community, but it still has a dedicated following that values its usability for everyday transactions.

If Trump wanted to make a statement that aligns with anti-establishment, anti-Fed, and pro-freedom narratives, BCH could fit that message surprisingly well. It’s not controlled by Wall Street, it’s not the crypto of choice for the traditional banking system, and it represents a challenge to the financial status quo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ij2q50/could_bitcoin_cash_bch_be_the_us_governments_most/,1,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP",positive

1ijqtp3,Is the Bitcoin/Altcoin Cycle still following past patterns?,user74729582,22,95,2025-02-07 09:02:34,"Hey everyone,

I've been digging into the charts and thinking about how past cycles played out. In 2013, 2017, and 2021, Bitcoin would hit new highs and then we’d see altcoins explode as Bitcoin dominance dipped. But this time, even though Bitcoin’s been flirting with the $100k mark, altcoins just aren’t showing the same explosive gains.

So, what’s up with this cycle? Are we just seeing a normal delay where alt season is simply running behind Bitcoin’s rally, or have things changed with all the new institutional money, ETFs, and regulatory shifts? It feels like there’s more to it than the old “Bitcoin leads, altcoins follow” narrative.

I’m curious if any of you have noticed the same thing. Is this a sign that the old cycle is breaking down, or are we still in the early stages and waiting for that typical rotation? Would love to hear your insights, experiences, or any interesting analysis you’ve come across on this.

1ikb5qp,"Altcoin Trap ,Future Possibilities & Strategies",Fit_Significance_549,99,29,2025-02-08 01:09:24,"Looking at the history of Bitcoin, I believe we are experiencing the most difficult and unpredictable traps ever seen in Altcoins. 

Currently, I think we are experiencing the second interim rally before the bull market. Looking at previous interim rallies before bull markets: there was one before the 2017 Bull and two before the 2021 Bull. 

In the first interim rally before the 2017 and 2021 Bulls, Bitcoin saw a drop of around 50%, while Altcoins dropped by about 70%. 

In the first interim rally of 2024, Bitcoin remained strong while Altcoins dropped by about 70%, similar to what happened in previous rallies. 

Thanks to this, with the influence of ETFs, we are witnessing the strongest Bitcoin ownership in history. 

In the bear market seasons of 2026, 2027, and 2028, we may not see a Bitcoin drop of 75% like in the past. I believe there is a possibility that Bitcoin will drop by only 50%, while Altcoins may experience a 95% drop and fade away. 

Looking at the second interim rally before the 2021 Bull: In August 2020, Bitcoin corrected from $12,500 to $10,000, a 20% drop. During the months of September, October, and November 2020, while Bitcoin dropped by 20%, Altcoins dropped by 70%. 

The biggest problem is that all interim rallies until now could be predicted. 

The first interim rally before the 2021 Bull in 2019 was predictable because, historically, it was expected that the Bull would occur in 2021. 

The second interim rally before the 2021 Bull in August 2020 was predictable because, before Bitcoin's sharp rises, Altcoins were rising more than Bitcoin, indicating a rally without Bitcoin completing its rise. 

The first interim rally before the 2025 Bull in March 2024 was predictable because Altcoins began to rise before Bitcoin broke its old highs and surpassed them. Since Bitcoin had not completed its rise, it was a sign of an interim rally. I had already predicted this. 

In December 2023, I repeatedly stated that we were in an interim rally before the Bull and that Altcoins could drop by 70%, and we should not remain fully in altcoins. 

However, the second interim rally before the 2025 Bull could not have been predicted. It truly was an unexpected trap. 

Before the Altcoin Rally, everything necessary happened perfectly. Bitcoin broke its old highs and rose more than Altcoins, completing its rise. Afterward, a correction took place. Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance rose together, with Bitcoin dominance reaching a peak. The disbelief psychology before the Altcoin Rally was also created. 

A year ago, I said that if the Bull's peak were to be postponed until 2025, we could experience one more interim rally, but I did not expect a trap to be set and an interim rally to be staged before the Altcoin Rally. 

When I expected a rally in 2025, I thought that Bitcoin would not rise as it is now, reaching only around $70,000, while Altcoins would rise 5-10 times, and Bitcoin dominance would fall. Before Bitcoin completed its rise, we would experience one more interim rally, and then the Bull would come at the end of 2025. 

The current scenario, where everything happens perfectly before the Altcoin Rally, followed by an unexpected third interim rally, could not have been predicted, and if I had seen this possibility, I would have given it a very small chance. I wouldn't risk missing the Altcoin Rally for this scenario. 

We cannot say that ""since we had two interim rallies before the 2021 Bull, we will definitely have an Altcoin Rally now."" 

We must always account for the possibility of a first-time event in history, as we have been taught through experience. 

Perhaps, before the Altcoin Rally, we will have a third interim rally, and we will experience rises until May. After a 5-fold rise from this level, Altcoins might drop by 70%. If this happens, the Altcoin Rally will be postponed until the end of 2025, and we will experience another interim rally. 

If we say, ""the market will definitely remain until the end of 2025,"" and rises begin in May, we might think, ""The market always falls in May, summer is always boring and lacks volume. Let's sell in this interim rally and buy lower."" 

In this scenario, if we experience an Altcoin Rally in the summer, it would be a first in Bitcoin history. What will we do? All our efforts will be wasted. 

We must not dismiss the possibility of an Altcoin Rally happening in the summer. If the Altcoin Rally is artificially triggered in the summer, it won't stop by us saying there will be no rise in the summer. 

The darkest days in the market are when the rallies start, and in the most exuberant days of the Bull when we are all buying, Altcoins reach their peaks, and then drop by 95%, fading away. We have no influence in this market. 

In the past, when Solana was $2, everyone thought it was a scam. When Sam from FTX was told, ""You locked our Solanas and scammed us,"" he responded by saying, ""Sell me your Solanas for $3."" 

When Solana was at $2 and no one trusted it, it later skyrocketed by 100 times, reaching $200, and then people started buying and trusting it. 

When Matic was at the bottom for 2 years, everyone said it was a coin that wouldn't rise, that the owners would run away. But Matic later rose 100 times, and then people began buying and trusting it.

When Chz was at the bottom for 2 years, only Turks were buying it. Chz, which was said to never rise, later increased by 20 times in 10 days and eventually 100 times from the bottom, and then people started buying and trusting it. 

The rallies always start when we lose trust in the coins. In the Bull market, when everyone is buying and trusting, coins peak, and then they drop by 95% and fade away. 

As for my strategy:

Personally, I will not risk missing the Altcoin Rally, aiming to earn more and increase my holdings. 

When the rise starts, I won't worry about whether we are experiencing the third interim rally. I will accept the possibility of the portfolio increasing 5 times and dropping by 70%. 

If rises start in May, I won't sell, thinking, ""We are definitely postponed until the end of 2025. The market always falls in May."" I will not dismiss the possibility of the Altcoin Rally happening for the first time in the summer and wait for my targets without selling.

We are in a period of great uncertainty. Only creating a strategy will save us from this uncertainty.

If you believe in the Altcoin Rally but want to reduce risk, here is a strategy: If rises occur by May, instead of selling like me, you can sell 15-20% of your portfolio to protect it in case of a third interim rally. That way, if the Altcoin Rally starts, a small portion of your portfolio will be outside, and you won't feel uncomfortable. You can buy back when a correction comes. If a third interim rally occurs, you can increase your holdings with the portion you sold. All possibilities are on the table, and you will decide what to do.

The most important thing we must accept is that we are not the hunters in this market, but the prey. 

We must not think of ourselves as superior in the market and always be prepared for every possibility. Whatever happens, whether there is a third interim rally or not, we must be on the winning side in every scenario. If the possibility we expect happens, we should consider the possibility of being wrong, avoid extra risks, and not engage in leveraged trading. We may earn a little less, but we should always be on the winning side.

how stupid am i. any advice? i need a 2x with what i have left to break even. any advice on what large stable coins to put in hopes i break even when/ if altcoin season starts. idk if i should maybe put the rest in xrp/sol, otc all it a day and hope one day the market recovers and i get a 2x. 

i just want my money back. i have no trading experience, never really even traded stocks much besides basic index funds or anything before getting into crypto, and i had no business investing all this money into crypto let alone these small to mid cap coins. i also based life based on some of these price predictions from youtubers and different charting TA accounts and my alts have completely plummeted instead. i sold because i was afriad they would plummet even more and when the market did recover they wouldnt pump enough to my point of entry.

Raj and Toly are literally the biggest parasites in the industry. They constantly shilled different tokens (jellyjelly, send, SSE, prcl, etc.) and most of these tokens, whenever the Solana founders shilled them, always get dumped to infinity.

I started suspecting that the Solana founders themselves are the main reasons why these tokens could get pumped for hours before they dumped it to infinity (and perhaps they double the profit by shorting those same tokens on hyperliquid). 

I would have never imagined it if Vitalik or other big founders shilled new tokens every week, just for the retail to get dumped over and over again. 

Don't get me wrong, I have made money too from Solana memecoins and AI agents, and admittedly I have lost money too, but the point remains, that their ""personal"" endorsements to different pump and dump coins were probably the reason why we would never have altseason, because retail will lose more and more money following the shills from the Solana founders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1in2p3u/why_cant_people_admit_solana_founders_are_the/,257,1,1,SOL,positive

1iohxb6,"Crypto ""Dust Attack"" and prevention tips !",Latorche1974,12,4,2025-02-13 12:26:44,"

Hey Guys !

A friend who work with us on Oscar on ETH and Dox on SOL got scammed through a ""Dust Attack"". 

I thought it might worth bringing this topic back so the more people become aware and stay safe !

A [Crypto Dust Attack](https://x.com/i/grok?text=Crypto%20Dust%20Attack) involves scammers sending minute amounts of cryptocurrency, known as ""[dust](https://x.com/i/grok?text=dust),"" to your wallet. The dust comes from addresses that are intentionally very similar to your own or a legitimate address you might interact with. The scam's aim is to confuse you into mistaking the attacker's address for your own or another's when you intend to make a transaction, leading you to send funds to the scammer.  
To prevent falling victim to these attacks:  


* Always Verify Addresses: Before sending any cryptocurrency, ensure you're using the correct address by checking it character by character, not just the beginning or end.
* Use Secure Wallets: Opt for wallets that offer robust security features like address verification or warnings for new or similar addresses. Some wallets might flag transactions from unknown sources.
* Ignore Unsolicited Crypto: Be wary of any unexpected crypto transactions, no matter how small. If you receive unsolicited funds, investigate before assuming it's legitimate.
* Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest scam tactics through reputable sources in the crypto community. Knowledge is your first line of defense.
* Enable Additional Security: Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://x.com/i/grok?text=two-factor%20authentication%20(2FA)) where possible and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings to add layers of security.
* By splitting your transactions into smaller amounts, you might avoid triggering the [automated scripts](https://x.com/i/grok?text=automated%20scripts) that monitor for [high-volume transactions](https://x.com/i/grok?text=high-volume%20transactions), which are often the targets for [dust attacks](https://x.com/i/grok?text=dust%20attacks). Since these scripts are typically set to look for transactions above a certain threshold, smaller transactions might not catch their attention.

Always stay safe friend !

1ioz763,XRP ETF Looks Like A Reality,ExtremeWhitewaterGuy,41,14,2025-02-14 01:29:08,"
The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale and NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF. The countdown to the approval of several spot XRP ETFs has begun.
The SEC has just given a green light to Grayscale’s proposal for a Spot XRP ETF by officially acknowledging the 19b-4 filing submitted via NYSE Arca—and now they’re calling on the public for feedback. In the filing posted last Thursday, the commission set a 21-day deadline for comments after the notice hits the Federal Register. Once that window closes, the SEC will decide whether to give this ETF the thumbs-up, knock it back, or even open up formal proceedings.

This 19b-4 filing is a crucial second step in launching a spot XRP ETF. Once it’s published in the Federal Register, the regulatory process really kicks into gear.

Recently, a slew of crypto ETFs—from Solana to Dogecoin—have been on the SEC’s radar as firms test the waters for regulatory approval.

The Crypto Thaw
This shift comes as the SEC appears to be easing up on its crypto stance following former Chair Gary Gensler’s departure last month. Gensler was famously skeptical, often labeling most cryptocurrencies as securities. In contrast, the agency has already approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and later, spot Ethereum ETFs, signaling a more welcoming environment for digital assets.

Asset managers including WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have each submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. Unlike futures-based products, a spot ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to XRP without the hassle of holding the coin. This isn’t just a clever piece of financial engineering—it’s a potential game-changer that bridges the gap between traditional Wall Street and the fast-moving crypto frontier.

These filings are more than just regulatory checkboxes; they’re statements of intent. The idea is to democratize access to XRP, inviting both retail investors and institutional titans to partake in what many see as the next big chapter in crypto history.

Today the SEC acknowledged Grayscale and the NYSE’s 19b-4 filing to list an XRP ETF.  It’s the bullish XRP news that Ripple watchers have been waiting for. 

xrp price prediction

XRP ETFs are close to approval wrote Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on X

Green Light Soon?
The SEC’s nod to the XRP 19b-4 filings isn’t just a bureaucratic checkbox—it’s a pivotal move in the ETF approval saga. While it doesn’t guarantee approval, it clearly shows that the wheels are turning. If, and when an XRP ETF does eventually get the green light, we could be staring down the barrel of a major institutional investment wave, one that’s likely to boost liquidity and demand significantly.

With regulatory clarity inching closer and Ripple making bold strides on the global stage, we have to ask: Are we on the verge of witnessing XRP’s metamorphosis from a mere utility asset into a bona fide mainstream financial instrument? If so, this isn’t just evolution—it’s a revolution that could upend traditional investment paradigms. XRP to the moon.

A Shifting Regulatory Landscape
With pro-crypto President Trump in charge, and new SEC chair Paul Atkins at the helm—whose track record hints at a more open-minded approach to digital assets—the stage is set for XRP ETF applications to clear the regulatory hurdle.

This potential pivot isn’t just about XRP—it’s emblematic of a broader transformation in how regulators might handle digital assets. For contrarians like us, it’s a fascinating development. While some fear that regulatory embrace could water down the decentralized ethos of crypto, others see it as the inevitable maturation of a market that’s been too raw for too long.

Market Impact: Bulls Charging, Bears on Alert
The ripple effects of these ETF applications could be huge. Analysts are already speculating that if approved, these ETFs could inject between $4 billion and $8 billion in net new assets into the XRP ecosystem within the first year. That’s not chump change—it’s a tidal wave of capital that could drive XRP’s price and liquidity to new heights. That means XRP price predictions for 2025 will have to be adjusted higher. As you can see on the XRP price chart below, the XRP price moved 4% higher on today’s news.

It likely means he believes the years of crazy volatility (where you make money) are over. No longer will BTC drop 5x -25x from top to bottom allowing you to 5x -25x your money if you play the cycles. The jig is up, there are no new retailers bc everyone is onto the cycle theory, everyone knows this. The ETFs will provide a price floor. So by moving to ETFs, he is saying, without saying that there is may not be anymore cycles to play.  Is this good or bad, I am not smart enough to figure that out. If it is TRUE and the cycles are very reduced (say we only drop to 70k from here for the bear), the ONLY way BTC goes up is new money.

They have used this money over the years to pay influencers to say ETH is great. It's not. If it was we would all be using it.

AVAX has a chance to be the ""next"" chain. It's founder Emin Gun Sirer found a flaw in ETH that caused them to do a hard fork. The thing they call ETH now is not the original Ethereum. (That's called Ethereum classic) AVAX believes no one chain can do everything. So they built a system that allows you to launch your own chain. The problem with AVAX is it's a bunch of boomers running it. It's very stuffy. When a new token is launched you have to be preselected to buy it. The same people over and over get selected which creates a strain on the community. It feels oppressive. 

Hbar is corporate America on the Blockchain. None of the companies in the order uses the token.

1it8e49,Fully MICA compliant EURQ stablecoin launched by DUSK,Ton1206,2,2,2025-02-19 15:40:27,"DUSK, Quantoz Payments and NPEX have released EURQ, a digital euro, opening up the way for traditional, regulated finance to operate at scale on the Dusk blockchain. This marks the first time a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF)-licensed stock exchange, NPEX, will utilize electronic money tokens (EMT) through a blockchain.

EURQ is designed to be MiCAR compliant. This partnership is the first time a licensed stock exchange, an EMT provider, and a blockchain foundation have combined forces, enabling a seamless, secure, and compliant bridge between traditional financial systems and blockchain-powered decentralized applications, allowing for the trading and issuance of regulated, real-world assets on-chain through Dusk and NPEX.

EURQ is more than just a stablecoin, it is an Electronic Money Token (EMT), suitable for use as legal tender. This is not just a stablecoin, this is a digital euro.

This partnership opens up many exciting avenues including:

A fully on-chain stock exchange. We have been working with NPEX for some time to build this, and EURQ is a vital piece, allowing investors to not only have access to a stablecoin, but to an actual euro.

Dusk Pay. The integration of Quantoz Payments is a vital piece for Dusk Pay, our on-chain payment systems. Dusk Pay aims to provide fast, cheap, regulatorily compliant on-chain payments, and having a stablecoin that meets these requirements is a necessity. With Quantoz, Dusk Pay gets a lot closer.

1it9cf3,Is Crypto Still Fair for Everyday Users?,SuccessOdd382,4,26,2025-02-19 16:18:45,"In 2025, the crypto space isn’t as fair as it was meant to be. According to Shutter Network contributor Loring Harkness, the rise of MEV bots, influential DAO voters, and large-scale players has left the average user feeling less secure and in control.

Cryptocurrency was originally designed to give people financial freedom, allowing anyone to transact anytime, anywhere, without restrictions. However, many believe that vision has been distorted over time. Harkness suggests that despite the challenges, there are straightforward solutions to restore fairness in crypto.

On Episode 14 of The Agenda podcast, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond sit down with Harkness to discuss how the Shutter Network uses encryption to protect users. They also explore the bigger picture, why creating a fair crypto ecosystem matters not just for traders but also for activists and those living under authoritarian regimes.

1ityxkh,Shorting Solana and Why I’m doing it (Solana Fan),MiamiHeatAllDay,0,24,2025-02-20 13:51:40,"EDIT: Looks like a called the ByBit Black Swan event a few days prior. I’m impressed with myself

So I’m a long term solana buyer and holder.

I’ve made great returns on it, but recently I believe I miscalculated what was going to happen after the trump pump.

I was holding on to an older way of thinking, and because I didn’t sell near the trump pump high, I was waiting to get back to those highs. I’m sure many of you are doing this rn.

However I decided to get on the sideline with SOL after the Libra scandal because my profits were sliding away fast. I’m not a hodlr, I like to time the market strategically during market trends. This has worked very well for me, with some bad calls here and there.

Given that background, I’ve been conducting a significant amount of market research on Solana and want to provide you all this information so you’re not stuck in an echo chamber 

Negative Narrative:

Solana has earned its way to the scammers paradise through meme pump and dumps

Solana already had a huge run up the last 1-2 years

FTX reimbursements are entering the market soon

LIBRA scandal (there is more to this watch the coffeezilla video) this could get a lot more ugly if what’s reported is true

Potential for exchange crash. There seems to be a huge scandal on an exchange every cycle. In this case there may be a black swan event around USDC (SOL) or JUP or another platform. (This is a stretch, but if it were gonna happen somewhere I believe it would happen on the solana network this cycle)

Other networks are viewed as more reliable or for serious business like Ethereum or Cardano

Positive Narrative:

SOL can do what it’s always done, provide a network for extremely fast and cost effective transactions 

Tax feee American cryptos

That’s about it

Price movement:

Everyone is aware how poorly SOL is doing in the last 7-30 days. It’s been hit a lot worse than the rest of the market. Even though the market is in the red, SOL is significantly lower

SOL price chart shows SOL about to dump right before the Trump Pump. One could argue we would have been at the current price sooner if not for that event.

Next lower resistance is in the 150s and then the 120s. With so much FUD, I would not be surprised that if we break through 160 that we end up at 120 in a 7 day period.

Competition:

XRP has positive narratives currently and none of the negative environment that surrounds solana

Ethereum is the first mover and 2nd largest crypto. It has a huge L2 network for low fees and has a lot of room for price growth this cycle

SUI, like solana without all the FUD

Conclusion:

Given all this information, I believe SOL will reach 120s as the new low and hold in that price area for the remainder of the alt bull run while other coins prosper. 

It may go even lower once alt season ends and we are in a true bear market.

I am a huge fan of SOL, it is my favorite crypto. However my main goal is to make money, and this is how I am seeing it.

As Thanos would say, “I’m sorry little one”

I’m shorting SOL

* **All-Time High:** Bitcoin reached its peak of about **$69,000** in **November 2021**.
* **Post-2021 Correction:** Since its peak, Bitcoin has gone through a significant bear market, with drops influenced by global economic tightening, crypto industry setbacks (e.g., major exchange failures), and rising interest rates.

I still recall discussing blockchain with my friend Mark, whose doubts about the uses of blockchain in real life beyond cryptocurrency perplexed me.

Blockchain technology has brought about affirmative change in numerous industrial sectors up to 2025. According to Grand View Research, the global blockchain market will experience explosive expansion in the finance, healthcare, and supply chain management segments, growing from a value of $10 billion in 2024 to $1.4 trillion in 2030.

The technology enables IBM and other companies to utilize blockchain for supply chain transparency, as products can be traced from end to end throughout their entire life cycle, from source to end-user.

Blockchain is being used by healthcare organizations to secure their patient data and achieve improved information sharing through enhanced interoperability while maintaining privacy standards.

By ensuring trust and governance, blockchain technology is projected to contribute $1.76 trillion to GDP by 2030, according to PwC numbers. The technology surely holds future promise, yet it continues to face challenges with cybersecurity.

Shocking Chart Says Long-Term Uptrend Intact,Dukangom,1,5,2025-02-22 03:01:07,"The blue line connects the historical highs of BTC, showing a distinct long-term upward trend that has yet to be broken. Currently, we are consolidating within the Fibonacci reversion level (0.382–0.618; approximately 88,000–102,000), as seen in the color band. The upward trend remains the same on the daily chart and there is no significant reversal signal yet.



Fibonacci levels: BTC has been hovering between 88,000 (0.618) and 102,000 (0.382), suggesting a healthy correction after the recent rally. Such a sideways move is common for bull market pauses.



Trendline: The blue line (historical high) acts as a dynamic support line. The bullish structure holds as long as the price remains above it.

Volume And Momentum: Volume is stable, but MACD shows some bearish divergence, but it's not enough to signal a breakthrough in the trend.



Conclusion: BTC's long-term uptrend is still alive and vibrant. The consolidation is expected to be resolved with a breakthrough of 102,000, potentially targeting new highs.

1ixh9m6,Maybe crushes are blessings in disguise,Distinct-Hold7796,12,13,2025-02-25 00:06:26,"very few folks have remained unshaken by the recent crypto crushes, especially the ones that have been occurring in the last couple of weeks. But, wait, these crushes, may be blessings in disguise. Let me explain what I mean. 

In Q1 of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) surged over 65%, rising from $44,167 to over $73,000, a stark contrast to previous halving years. Unlike past cycles, altcoins also rallied despite global quantitative tightening (QT), fueled by Bitcoin ETF approvals and anticipated rate cuts.

However, in Q1 of 2025, a post-halving period that typically sparks an altseason, altcoins are struggling even with quantitative easing (QE) on the horizon. One key reason is that Q1 2024 absorbed excessive liquidity, keeping alt valuations high and reducing their potential for parabolic growth. Unlike past cycles, where altcoins entered the post-halving phase deeply undervalued, many remain too expensive for whales seeking significant multiples.

Other factors also contribute to the delay. The explosion of meme coins has diluted liquidity, limiting capital inflows into established altcoins. Macroeconomic risks, such as Trump’s tariff threats, regulatory uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions, have driven investors toward safer assets. Additionally, the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has funneled institutional liquidity away from smaller coins. Retail traders, many still underwater from 2024, remain hesitant to rotate into altcoins.

Furthermore, blockchain adoption has lagged behind speculation. Unlike previous cycles driven by strong narratives like ICOs in 2017 or DeFi in 2020, no new major trend has emerged to reignite demand. Meanwhile, rising yields on stablecoins and traditional finance instruments like U.S. Treasuries offer attractive passive income, diverting capital from speculative markets.

That said, the frequent market crashes could be a blessing in disguise. These corrections create conditions for whales to re-enter at discounted prices, setting the stage for a future altcoin rally. However, another key factor delaying altseason is the unusually high market capitalization of altcoins at present. Historically, alts have entered the post-halving phase with much lower valuations, leaving ample room for explosive gains. In contrast, the elevated alt market cap now makes it harder for major players to justify aggressive accumulation. With QE expected to inject fresh liquidity, institutional and high-net-worth investors may start rotating back into alts once conditions stabilize, but this process may take longer than in previous cycles.

While altseason may still arrive later in 2025, its delay is driven by a mix of liquidity exhaustion, unusually high alt market cap, macro risks, and shifting investor behavior. Until a fresh catalyst emerges, Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely maintain dominance, while altcoins remain in consolidation—potentially setting the stage for the next wave of exponential growth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ixh9m6/maybe_crushes_are_blessings_in_disguise/,12,1,1,"BTC, ETH",neutral

Liquidity is a big problem right now. When people panic-sell alt-coins, it gets tough to buy or sell at good prices. And with over $1 billion pulled out of Bitcoin ETFs recently, things are getting even worse.

The S&P 500 and other traditional markets can really impact crypto prices. When those markets are all over the place, crypto often takes a hit because investors get scared and avoid risks.  
  
Economic stuff like inflation can also affect crypto. If inflation goes up, it might lead to tighter monetary policies, which can make crypto prices drop even more.

1ixsuc7,Why I think Trump’s admin is bad for Bitcoin and crypto,sir_band,0,14,2025-02-25 11:28:55,"Bitcoin started as this wild, anti-establishment experiment. It is (or at least - was) a rebel move against the traditional finance system where you could flex your independence without banks or governments breathing down your neck. Back in the day, the internet was all about counting Bitcoin “deaths” like it was a meme-worthy horror show, proving no one really believed it would make it. Yet, it made it.

Fast forward, and now the big dogs - financial institutions and governmental entities  - are all over it, pumping in over 60% of the trading volume and billions of dollars into the game. This isn’t your scrappy, decentralized dream anymore - it’s become another ticker on Wall Street. The disregard and obituaries turned into institutionalized bullish sentiments. When BlackRock’s CEO drops a bomb price target of $700k, it’s a clear sign that Bitcoin’s metamorphosing from a symbol of freedom into a mainstream, profit-chasing commodity, which is kinda crushing that raw, anarchistic vibe it once had.

Institutional hype is stripping away Bitcoin's original countercultural mojo. But institutions, now controlling the market, won't be satisfied with just a dream. They want application and utility. They want a tangible future. The long-term dream will slowly erode under the weight of reality, exposing that there is nothing beneath Bitcoin that could be considered a true asset.

1iy6kla,Bitcoin and M2 money supply corelation,Intelligent-Okra8448,0,0,2025-02-25 21:36:27,"The correlation between M2 money supply and Bitcoin is a fascinating topic that has garnered significant attention from investors and economists alike. Here's a deeper dive into the relationship:

# Understanding M2 Money Supply

M2 represents a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. It is a broader indicator than M1 (which only includes cash and checking deposits) and is often used to gauge the amount of money circulating in an economy. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, influence M2 through monetary policy decisions. During times of economic downturn, these institutions may increase the money supply to stimulate growth. Conversely, they may reduce M2 growth to curb inflation. These actions can significantly impact asset prices, including that of Bitcoin.

# The Correlation with Bitcoin

Historically, Bitcoin’s price has shown a notable correlation with the M2 money supply growth rate. Here are some key trends observed over the years2:

* **2014-2015**: During this period, the M2 money supply growth was either stagnating or decreasing. This decline in money supply growth correlates with the drop in Bitcoin prices, emphasizing the negative impact of reduced liquidity on BTC’s market performance.
* **2016-2018**: M2 growth continued at a steady pace. The rebound in BTC’s price as M2 growth remained positive further supports the idea that increasing money supply provides a favorable environment for BTC price appreciation.
* **2020-2021**: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the US Federal Reserve to drop the interest rate from 2% to 0% and inject unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the global economy. The rapid expansion of M2 during this time coincided with one of Bitcoin’s most explosive bull markets. Investors flocked to Bitcoin as a hedge against potential inflation and currency devaluation.
* **2023-2024**: Recent trends show a stabilization in M2 growth, with Bitcoin’s price reflecting a period of consolidation or moderate growth.

# Key Drivers of the Correlation

1. **Inflationary Pressures**: Historically, an increase in M2 signals inflationary tendencies, prompting investors to seek assets like Bitcoin as a hedge.
2. **Global Liquidity**: M2 growth correlates with higher liquidity, which often aligns with Bitcoin price rallies. However, this cycle deviates from historical norms, with M2 nearing cyclical lows while Bitcoin continues its upward trend. This inconsistency raises questions about the predictive power of the M2 correlation.

# Counterarguments

Not all analysts agree with the reliance on M2 correlation for Bitcoin forecasts. Some argue that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility makes it unreliable for direct comparisons to M2 or other traditional financial indicators.

In summary, while there is a historical correlation between M2 money supply and Bitcoin, it is essential to consider broader macroeconomic factors and the inherent volatility of Bitcoin when analyzing this relationship.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1iy6kla/bitcoin_and_m2_money_supply_corelation/,0,1,1,BTC,positive
1iy72bl,"XRP,BTC growth catalysts",Wmpathos0321,0,9,2025-02-25 21:56:54,"Institutional adoption of blockchain assets is accelerating, but not all tokens capture value in the same way. While XRP, ONDO, and BTC each have asymmetric upside, their ability to benefit from institutional adoption varies significantly. Understanding the differences in value capture mechanisms is crucial for positioning effectively.

Furthermore, regulatory shifts are playing a crucial role in shaping institutional sentiment. [President Donald Trump’s executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) aimed at expediting crypto regulations could serve as a pivotal moment for institutional adoption in the U.S. Meanwhile, [Brazil’s XRP ETF approval](https://www.coindesk.com/) underscores growing global acceptance, and BRICS nations are accelerating their move toward [de-dollarization](https://www.bloomberg.com/), threatening the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. These geopolitical shifts have major implications for blockchain assets.

Adding to the urgency of regulatory clarity, [former CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo](https://www.cftc.gov/) recently predicted that within the next 12 years, no securities will be created that are not issued on-chain, stating: **“In the future, we will see a world where every financial instrument will exist in some form on distributed ledger technology.”** This highlights the inevitability of tokenized finance and the need for regulatory adaptation, making Trump’s executive order and global regulatory shifts even more critical.

# XRP: The Institutional Adoption Engine

# XRP’s Path to Profit and Market Share Expansion

XRP has positioned itself as a major player in institutional finance, particularly in cross-border liquidity and payments. Its path to profitability and market dominance is reinforced by key developments:



* **Partnerships & Banking Adoption**: Ripple has partnered with hundreds of financial institutions globally, including [Santander](https://www.santander.com/), [SBI Holdings](https://www.sbigroup.co.jp/), and [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/). These partnerships enhance XRP’s use in cross-border transactions.
* **FedNow & Real-Time Settlement**: XRP is positioned to integrate into instant payment networks, including potential collaboration with [**FedNow**](https://www.frbservices.org/fednow), the Federal Reserve's real-time payment system. While no direct integration has been confirmed, Ripple’s payment network aligns with FedNow’s objectives for faster and more efficient settlements.
* **SWIFT Integration & ISO 20022 Compliance**: XRP is one of the few assets aligned with [**ISO 20022**](https://www.iso.org/iso-20022.html), the global messaging standard for financial transactions. Potential integration with [**SWIFT**](https://www.swift.com/), which handles trillions in global settlements daily, could drive massive liquidity demand.
* **XRP ETFs & Institutional Holdings**: With ETF filings gaining momentum, an [XRP ETF approval](https://www.sec.gov/) could act as a catalyst for major capital inflows, mirroring Bitcoin’s ETF-driven adoption.
* **Regulatory and Institutional Roadmap**: The [**Ripple Liquidity Hub**](https://ripple.com/liquidity-hub/) aims to streamline institutional adoption by providing seamless fiat-to-crypto and cross-border liquidity services, reinforcing XRP’s role in the future financial system.
* **Potential SEC Appeal Withdrawal or Defeat in Court:** With new leadership at the SEC, the agency’s approach to crypto enforcement may shift, increasing the likelihood that the **appeal against Ripple is either withdrawn or ultimately defeated in court**. Judge Torres' ruling already established that **XRP’s secondary sales are not securities**, and the SEC’s appeal is narrow in scope. If the appeal is dropped or lost, **this would mark the final regulatory hurdle for XRP in the U.S., opening the door for broader institutional adoption, banking integrations, and potential ETF approvals.**



By solidifying its role in the financial infrastructure of banks, payments networks, and regulatory-compliant frameworks, XRP has a clear roadmap for institutional demand growth and value appreciation.

# BTC: The Institutional Hedge and Supply Shock Catalyst

# Bitcoin’s Path to Profitability and Store of Value Expansion

Bitcoin continues to serve as the ultimate hedge against inflation, economic uncertainty, and monetary debasement. BTC’s institutional growth path is defined by:



* **ETF Adoption & Institutional Custody**: The approval of [spot Bitcoin ETFs](https://www.blackrock.com/) has legitimized BTC as an institutional asset. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity now offer Bitcoin exposure to traditional investors.
* **Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) & Accumulation**: Large SWFs are beginning to allocate capital to BTC. Countries such as [Norway](https://www.nbim.no/), [UAE](https://www.adia.ae/), and [Saudi Arabia](https://www.pif.gov.sa/) are exploring BTC as part of their diversified reserve strategies. If SWFs begin allocating even 1-2% of their portfolios into BTC, it could significantly reduce available supply.
* **Fixed Supply & Supply Shock Dynamics**: With only [**21 million BTC**](https://www.bitcoin.org/) ever to exist, institutional accumulation drastically reduces available supply. A major allocation from SWFs could create a supply squeeze, leading to significant price appreciation.
* **Corporate Treasury Adoption**: Companies like [MicroStrategy](https://www.microstrategy.com/), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), and [Square](https://www.block.xyz/) have incorporated BTC into their balance sheets, reinforcing its role as a treasury reserve asset.
* **Lightning Network for Scalability**: The [**Lightning Network**](https://lightning.network/) is being developed to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability, allowing for faster transactions and lower fees, making BTC more usable for payments beyond being just a store of value.
* **Regulatory Challenges & Adoption Risks**: The [**Biden Administration’s stance on crypto**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/) and potential taxation policies could impact BTC adoption rates, making regulatory clarity a key factor in institutional uptake.



As sovereign wealth funds and institutional players allocate even small percentages of their portfolios into Bitcoin, its scarcity-driven price mechanics could result in exponential valuation growth over time.

# ONDO: The Governance Dilemma and Path to Profitability

# ONDO’s Potential for Value Accrual

ONDO Finance has emerged as a leader in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), a sector projected to exceed **$10 trillion by 2030**. With support from [**BlackRock**](https://www.blackrock.com/), [**JPMorgan**](https://www.jpmorgan.com/), and [**Franklin Templeton**](https://www.franklintempleton.com/), ONDO is positioned to be a key infrastructure provider for tokenized U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, and real estate.

However, ONDO’s governance model presents a critical challenge—**it does not yet capture direct financial value**. For ONDO to be profitable, the community or institutions must vote on:



* **Fee-sharing mechanisms** that distribute a portion of transaction fees to ONDO holders.
* **Staking incentives** to encourage long-term holding.
* **Buybacks or deflationary mechanics** to reduce supply and increase scarcity.



One concern is that institutions like **JPMorgan’s Onyx** might offer competing tokenization services, potentially capturing market share from ONDO. Whether institutions push for **yield-generating mechanisms within ONDO governance** will determine its long-term investment viability.

# Conclusion: Balancing Asymmetry with Value Capture

For investors looking to balance risk and reward, a strategic allocation across [**BTC (hedge)**](https://www.blackrock.com/)**,** [**XRP (institutional adoption)**](https://www.ripple.com/)**, and** [**ONDO (asymmetric governance play)**](https://www.ondo.finance/) allows for exposure to different market dynamics while managing downside risks. **However, investors should also consider ongoing regulatory developments, institutional roadmaps, and governance structures to maximize potential upside.**

**The institutions are coming—investors just need to position before the liquidity floodgates open.**

1iy969z,How do you approach projects in the bear market?,minibuddy0,0,5,2025-02-25 23:27:09,"Something I've always thought about and has even more recently because of a conversation I came across on X is how the community or people that engage with a project approach it when the price action is poor, and not as good as they expect.

This is not something I have a personal experience with, I usually engage with projects after they've shown a bit of promise, but I was on X and there was a post about ZOO and how the project should transcend the price action.

  
For context, ZOO is one of those projects on TON, that rewards users for building and managing like a virtual zoo, but that's not the point, the point is that, since it listed the price hasn't been the best, and while there are complaints, under the post I mentioned earlier, I see people maintaining that it's work simplifying entry into web3 and Defi by offering an interactive Telegram game, is way more important than short term price movements.

But for me as a neutral, when I see stuff like this, the first thing I think about is to buy the deep, and that is if I really believe in the project utilities, or find other ways to make money from it probably via futures. Some people had similar ideas because I saw comments about getting extra tokens from the candybomb on Bitget instead of just sitting on the tokens, which is smart if they play their cards right.

  
The major school of thought is ""buy the dip"" and ""leverage opportunities to increase profit"" and I'd like to know if there are other approaches to stuff like that, or if you just cut your losses and abandon it entirely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1iy969z/how_do_you_approach_projects_in_the_bear_market/,0,0,0,,positive

1iyy0u8,I asked Deepseek about cryptocurrency.,ahood101,0,7,2025-02-26 20:55:25,"Cryptocurrency can be compared to a disorganized lottery where participants buy and sell at different times, creating an unpredictable and uneven distribution of rewards. Unlike a traditional lottery with a fixed draw date, the ""crypto lottery"" has no clear start or end point, especially during bull runs, which are periods of rising prices. For example, imagine 1 million people each invest $100 in a cryptocurrency. One person buys early, while another buys a year later. Both invest the same amount, but the early buyer stands to gain significantly more because they entered the market when prices were lower. This dynamic means the first buyers often reap the majority of the rewards, while later buyers are left hoping for a price surge to profit. In this sense, the crypto market is less like a traditional lottery, where all participants have an equal chance of winning, and more like a race where timing is everything. The early adopters benefit the most, while the latecomers are essentially gambling on becoming the ""lottery winner"" by buying in at the right moment before the market peaks or crashes.

In this alternative system, 1 million people each donate $100 every month, pooling together a total of $100 million. Each month, 100 contributors are randomly selected to receive $1 million each. Once selected, these individuals are removed from future draws, ensuring a fresh group of 100 people is chosen the following month. This creates a structured and fair lottery-like system where everyone has an equal chance of being selected, and the rewards are distributed evenly over time. Unlike the unpredictable and timing-dependent nature of cryptocurrency, this model guarantees that 100 people will win $1 million every month, providing a clear and transparent way to share the pooled funds. Over time, all contributors have a chance to benefit, and the process continues until everyone in the pool has had an opportunity to win. This approach eliminates the advantage of early participants and ensures a more equitable distribution of rewards.

Users of cryptocurrency cannot complain about losing money while rejecting this structured format and instead expecting to win when the structure is few early winners and majority late losers.

I am definitely not crying about my portfolio is in the red, because I always keep 1/3 stocks 1/3 crypto 1/3 cash, so A] I have enough dry powder to by the dip, and B] I already cut some losses by last week, so that last 2 downwards waves didn’t hit me. 

What I would love to discuss with you, is that (in my humble opinion) almost everything must be priced in, despite  maybe WW3. That’s why I choose the title. 

After weeks of bad news, rugg-pulls, hacks, tariffs, the orange man being the orange man, a fear & greed index of around 10 and a truly negative sentiment, I really scratch my head and ask myself after all that shitshow, we reach a point where another 2-3 downwards waves would bring us to the point of total market capitulation. What sounds like a bad thing, is actually a positive factor, because once a person lost 75-90% of an asset its actually LESS LIKELY that this person would sell, instead that person just would try to sit this out, if needed until the next bull in 2028/2029. 

So what I mean by this, now since almost everything has been priced in, and we slowly reach a point of buyers capitulation, the sell-pressure probably will fade. 

I would recommend to hold on.

April has the highest historical average return at 35.2%. April has been a standout month for BTC, showing major gains in past cycles:
	•	2013: +49.7%
	•	2017: +33.7%

	•	Even in 2021, which had weaker April returns (+15.3%), it was still one of the best months of the year.

Bitcoin’s halving event in April 2024 is expected to create a supply squeeze. Historically, BTC sees explosive growth within 6-12 months after halvings as demand outpaces the new supply of coins.

1j2e0gc,Odds of succeeding with Strategic Reserve,Distinct-Hold7796,4,4,2025-03-03 08:20:52,"I asked ChatGPT about the likelihood that Donald Trump’s executive order to include crypto in the U.S. strategic reserve would fail. Does not look like it will go through easily!

Here is it's response...

---------------------------------

Donald Trump (or any U.S. president) could attempt to issue an executive order (EO) declaring certain cryptocurrencies as part of the U.S. strategic reserve, but several legal and practical barriers make it highly unlikely to be enforceable. Here’s why:

1. Executive Power Limitations

Congress Controls Monetary Policy: The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to ""coin Money"" and ""regulate the Value thereof"" (Article I, Section 8). Cryptocurrencies, if classified as money, would fall under this purview, meaning Trump would need congressional approval.

Federal Reserve's Role: The Federal Reserve, an independent entity, is responsible for managing monetary policy. A president cannot unilaterally dictate what constitutes U.S. reserves without legislative backing.

Separation of Powers: An EO cannot override existing financial regulations or compel the Fed or Treasury to adopt new assets.


2. Legal Restrictions on Government Reserves

Strategic Reserves Definition: The U.S. strategic reserves typically include commodities like oil (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) or precious metals (gold). There are no legal precedents for digital assets being considered ""reserves.""

1934 Gold Reserve Act: This law centralized gold holdings under federal control but does not extend to digital assets.

Government Asset Acquisition: Agencies like the Treasury need congressional authorization to acquire or hold assets as part of reserves.


3. Regulatory Framework for Cryptocurrencies

SEC and CFTC Jurisdiction: Cryptos fall under different classifications—some are securities (SEC), some are commodities (CFTC). Any attempt to use them as reserves would require regulatory clarification and new laws.

AML/KYC and National Security Concerns: Some cryptos are viewed as risky due to potential illicit use. Adding them to reserves would trigger national security reviews.


4. Political and Institutional Resistance

Congress Opposition: Both parties would likely push back, particularly those skeptical of cryptocurrencies' stability and regulation.

Federal Reserve and Treasury Pushback: These institutions prioritize stability and would resist such an unconventional move.


Odds of This Happening?

Very Low (Near 0%) without congressional approval.

Even if an EO is issued, it would likely be immediately challenged in court and blocked.


For Trump to make crypto part of U.S. reserves, he would need a Republican-controlled Congress willing to pass enabling legislation—and even then, it would face significant opposition from financial institutions and regulators.

Bitcoin’s Rollercoaster Ride

On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced plans to establish a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, aiming to include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana’s SOL token, Cardano’s ADA, and XRP. This announcement initially propelled Bitcoin’s price to a peak of $94,834 on Monday. However, these gains were short-lived; by the afternoon, Bitcoin’s value had retreated to approximately $86,000.  ￼

The market’s initial enthusiasm was tempered by skepticism from experts who cited concerns over the lack of detailed information and the timing of the announcement. Additionally, new tariffs imposed on Mexico and Canada have contributed to a cautious market sentiment.  ￼

Altcoins Under Pressure

Altcoins have mirrored Bitcoin’s volatility, with many experiencing sharp declines. For instance, Ethereum saw its value drop from $2,548 to $2,138 following the announcement of the crypto reserve.  ￼ Other altcoins, including Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano, have also faced sharper declines amid the broader market downturn.  ￼

This sell-off has led traders to seek protective measures, such as purchasing put options, to hedge against further declines. The increased demand for downside protection indicates a prevailing cautious sentiment among investors.  ￼

Market Outlook

The current market dynamics underscore the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency space. While institutional interest and regulatory developments continue to influence prices, external factors such as geopolitical events and macroeconomic policies play significant roles.

1j5c82h,Trump insider trading?,bullinside,233,367,2025-03-07 01:45:19,"Well, Trump has seemingly crushed crypto again. Now, it doesn’t appear to be a promised crypto reserve but just an existing stockpile of crypto dubbed the ""crypto reserve."" I think he's orchestrating moves behind the scenes. It wouldn't be surprising if Russians are helping execute his trades, which might explain why he’s so friendly toward them. He seems to pump the market over the weekend with his tweets, only to dump it all on Monday morning—just like what happened last weekend at the market open.

Then, he signs this stockpile order, effectively crushing crypto, just one day before the ""good news"" from the crypto summit. It’s likely he’s shorting the market now to profit in the morning, only to reverse the move again with some ""good news"" during tomorrow's summit. These tactics feel far too convenient for someone who might have advance knowledge and is exploiting it for personal gain. It always seems to work against us traders who lack insider information. Is it just me, or does anyone else see this pattern of manipulation too clearly to ignore?

Since he got to power, it feels like he is not prohibiting crypto, but pro making waves in the markets. He claims that he doesn't even look at the markets, but with the number of lies he says over a day, I'd rather not believe anything he says.

1j5dhds,Wish I Had Invested,jswell823,0,12,2025-03-07 02:50:49,"25M - I know it's no crazy statement since it's skyrocketed, but I wish I invested in crypto back in 2021 when I started long-term investing as a whole. Obviously it's my responsibility for not doing so, but I think a part of it was because the people around me that I looked to for guidance didn't have any desire to be involved. Fast forward to now, I don't understand why you wouldn't have exposure to it. Even if just like 2-3% of your portfolio. 

That all being said, is it worth starting to DCA into a crypto portfolio now? (I was thinking maybe \~1/3 BTC, \~1/5 ETH, and then I don't really know what to sprinkle the rest across? I'm willing to be semi-aggressive since I'm young and it's a tiny percentage of savings). Or is it better to wait until the bull run is completely over. Everything I read and watch says crypto has continuously followed a 4-year cycle. And if that holds true and the boom continues through 2025 and then crashes in 2026... I'm not sure if I start DCAing now, or completely wait for any substantial crash and then begin.

1j5fl2m,What are your thoughts on a BTC profit-taking strategy based on $200 increments?,Afatah_Kheir,1,31,2025-03-07 04:47:10,"Hey everyone, I’ve been considering a new strategy for Bitcoin (BTC) trading and would love to hear your thoughts.

The strategy involves investing in Bitcoin and then withdrawing profits each time the price increases by $200, while leaving the original investment intact. For example, if I buy BTC at $82,000 with $10,000, I’d withdraw the profit whenever the price goes up by $200. This means that if BTC hits $82,200, I would take out the $200 profit, leaving the rest of my investment to continue appreciating with the price of BTC.

The goal is to lock in incremental profits while allowing the original investment to grow over time. Essentially, it allows me to benefit from smaller price movements without fully exiting my position.

I’m curious to hear the community’s thoughts on this approach:

* Do you think this strategy could be consistently profitable, especially with Bitcoin's volatility?
* Are there any potential risks or drawbacks I might be missing, such as transaction fees, market timing, or missed opportunities?
* How could this strategy be improved for better long-term results?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1j5fl2m/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_btc_profittaking/,1,1,1,BTC,positive
1j5jyup,THE US JUST ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE. WHY ISN’T EVERYONE CELEBRATING?,sks143,0,47,2025-03-07 09:49:38,"So let me get this straight. For YEARS, we’ve been saying we want institutional adoption, we want governments to recognize Bitcoin as a legit store of value, we want BTC to be treated like digital gold… and now that the biggest government in the world just announced they’re creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, people are sitting here like nothing happened? Like what??

The US isn’t just buying Bitcoin; they’re never selling it. The Treasury is literally setting up a vault to hoard BTC forever. If you don’t understand what this means, think about gold reserves. Central banks do not dump their reserves; they accumulate. The biggest banks, funds, and governments have been buying for months, while retail is out here trying to scalp $100 pumps. You really think they’re doing this for fun?

I get it, price action is weird right now. Maybe people are still waiting for some mega pump, or they’re expecting some hidden catch. But let’s be real: this is what we’ve been waiting for. A nation-state level commitment to Bitcoin.

Not to mention, supply shock is coming. 

We’ve got:
	a) The US locking away BTC in a permanent reserve
	b)	ETFs hoovering up supply daily
	c)	We’re already deep into the post-halving cycle, and we know what happens in these years
	d)	Retail still sleeping on it while institutions load up

We’ve seen this story before. Only difference now is that it’s not just Michael Saylor or random funds accumulating; it’s the United States government. The same government that used to FUD crypto is now leading adoption.

So tell me, why isn’t everyone celebrating this?? Is it just market manipulation? Institutions trying to suppress price before they go even heavier? Genuinely curious what you guys think. Because from where I’m sitting, this is the most bullish thing to happen to Bitcoin since its creation.

Oh, and if you’re still selling your BTC right now… good luck buying back when supply gets choked out.

The U.S. economy is in rough shape, making it unlikely that bullish momentum will come from the U.S. market.

Yet when the time comes they do the opposite. Back in December when we were in extreme greed, not many were selling. After we just hit a 10 on fear greed index, no one is buying and those same ppl are saying bull runs over. 

If you’re gonna regurgitate something, as least have the composure to go through with it. It’s not as easy as “oh everyone fearful this is great I’ll buy!” The reason everyone is fearful is because the market looks like it’ll never recover and that it’s over. To buy fear is to go against that sentiment that you feel. You’re not gonna be in a market where things look bad, suddenly greed spikes so you say oh yes this means time to sell! In the moment you think it’s a trend reversal and will ape back in during greed. 

Don’t quote great investors if you don’t understand what it truly means. It means buying when everyone is calling you an idiot, and feeling like you’re crazy. It means selling when everyone around you is still making crazy money. THAT is what is meant by those quotes. Not oh yea it’s easy to buy fear duhhh, when it’s fear I’ll buy hehe. When it’s fear, it’s fear for a reason so you won’t want to fucking buy. Do it anyway or shut the fuck up. People trying to act more self aware than they are and it’s pissing me off.

1j7fq9a,"Seeds in Chaos, Petals in Profit - A traders guide to reading the market through nature's lens.",TheWhiteShadow-,4,0,2025-03-09 19:40:34,"The following is a unique trading guide I wrote, I'm thinking of putting in a book.  
***Transparency:*** *This Idea is my own, and was written by me in grammarly. I used grok to help self edit and to confirm if my personal mindset fit along with the mindset in the books I drew inspiration from.*



**Intro:**   
This trader's guide is not another cookie-cutter trading system.   
Instead, it focuses on building a long-term mindset and a way to read the market's chaos through nature's lens. This guide is grounded in real success but is not for the daily trader; it works for long-term swings using hourly price moves.

Over seven years of trading, I developed a unique way to view the market, which led to a practical trading mindset. The technique comes from simplifying the chart after experiencing endless combinations of indicators to no avail. It wasn't until I had to explain my concept to someone else that I found a way to use a garden analogy that fits the mindset well to see the market as a natural system: planting in chaos, thriving through storms.  
Later, I read two books: ""The Alchemy of Finance"" by George Soros and ""The Misbehavior of Markets"" by Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson. Surprisingly, these two books validated my approach and inspired me to share it. Previously, I would tell no one because I thought it was silly.

The overall goal is to plant a garden, watch it grow, and understand how the weather affects the plants. This guide walks you through determining what flowers you want to plant and how to read the weather after you have made your choice.   
It uses a garden and planting flowers as an analogy to choosing the right stocks and interpreting an EMA indicator to determine the market's direction. This guide also works well for Bitcoin.

This guide will help you understand how to read and interpret the chart. It will also give you accurate future context so you react less to the market moves and see the bigger picture: Plant while they panic. 

**This guide is not financial advice.**

**Part One - Planting.**  
Some traders focus on various companies based on technicals or fundamentals, some short-term and some long-term. Other traders will focus on a few stocks or diversify across many.   
For this guide, we pick and diversify a sector with roles that thrive together. The industry can be broad or small, but we will use 10 assets, including nine stocks and Bitcoin, and explain how they correlate and grow into a weather-worthy garden.

In this garden, we will focus on Tech and Finance and explain how to plant and organize the garden. First, we must look back at the broadest picture in finance. We will choose a stock exchange and a crypto exchange in this garden. (1 and 2 out of 10 flowers)   
Why an exchange? Simply put, traders will always look for stocks and crypto to buy. They will look for the best companies and the best opportunities. Therefore, stock exchanges will benefit from the revenue they generate. If a stock goes parabolic, the exchange still profits from that price move.  
Choosing the exchange skips the hassle of finding companies in a haystack. The same is true for the crypto exchange. Our garden has two flowers: one stock exchange and one crypto exchange, representing those two sectors.

Next, what else can correlate with our garden from a zoomed-out view?  
Let's choose a Bank and a payment processor. (3 and 4 out of 10 flowers)   
Traders will need the bank to on and offramp their cash profits to and from the stock and crypto exchange. Meanwhile, they will need to process those electronic payments.   
The bank and payment processors benefit from trading surges; if everyone piles in for a parabolic price move of a particular stock, the bank and payment processors benefit from the action, and the exchanges offering the stock get revenue from the surge.  
Once again, this choice skips the need to hunt for specific stocks. It takes advantage of all stocks since traders need cash, banks, electronic payments, and exchanges to buy those company stocks or bitcoin.  
Our garden now has Four flowers, a bank and payment processor, and two exchanges for this sector. The correlation? Exchanges, banks, and processors all thrive when traders move money.

The fifth is a pivot flower before we discuss the tech company sector. This pivot flower is a gambling company (5 out of 10).   
How does this correlate? Some traders and other users gamble with their cash and profits; even in a recession or a depression, people will still gamble. Plus, users might take their gambling winnings and invest them in a stock or buy bitcoin. They need a bank, an exchange, and a payment method.  
In this case, the flowers are self-reinforcing: gambling winnings or losses, stock booms or busts; it doesn't matter in the big picture because, once again, exchanges, banks, and processors all thrive when people move money. Our garden now has five flowers with a broad but strong correlation.

Now, on to the tech sector with the last five flowers.   
You will hone in on specific tech roles at this point, but remember that your choices will be self-reinforcing.   
If your choice booms, the exchange benefits, and you benefit again from the exchange stock. You will electronically transfer your profits to your bank, which you benefit from by owning the bank stock and payment processor. But if you're smart, you will skip the gambling and let the crowd roll the dice while you plant the profits.

We will focus on two more flowers (6 and 7 out of 10) for tech, so we need to find companies exposed to the popular and relevant tech we want. For tech company 1, you could expose yourself to AI, EVs, and ROBOTS. For tech company 2, Semiconductors (or graphics cards).  
In this section of our garden, graphic cards and AI rely on one another, while EVs and robots use AI to operate. Eventually, people will buy or sell the robot and EV, and some may use the profits to buy stock (or Bitcoin), requiring a bank and payment processor.   
Meanwhile, people use LLMs, log into their bank, or exchange daily on a computer that requires a graphics card.   
Our garden now has seven flowers out of 10, 3 more to go!

We want to diversify (but stay correlated with our garden), so next, we will look at a real estate company or ETF—but not just any company or ETF, one that develops in tech hub areas. How does this correlate?   
Robots, AI, EVs, and graphics cards all need workers to operate the companies; young talent will want to move to places where they can work in AI or Robotics or factory EV workers, so the real estate in those areas will be in high demand, so now we own the real estate for our Ai, EV, Robots, and graphic card workers.  
As tech grows, real estate booms, driving more money through exchanges, banks, and processors.  
We now have eight flowers in our weather-worthy garden.

For the 9th flower, we turn to a wildflower: none other than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not just a crypto coin but a capital asset, a store of value for your currency when it debases.  
People, especially tech workers, will buy, trade, and sell Bitcoin.   
As people learn and turn to the asset, global capital will flow through Bitcoin as people around the world save their cash value,   
whether it be from gambling winnings, selling a car, selling real estate, selling a stock, or simply putting part of their income from their tech job into it regularly. All of this requires Exchanges, Banks, and payment processors to move.   
Bitcoin correlates with that, as exchanges profit off bitcoin, which you own stock in the exchange company. You still need a bank to land on and a payment processor to move the money electronically.  
We now have nine flowers in our garden, and it's almost complete.

How can we diversify even more? We can use industrial metal for our last flower, but how does an industrial metal correlate with our tech and finance garden?  
Copper is the metal that conducts electricity, and electricity is needed to move money, send Bitcoin, power a growing network of EV superchargers, and power the factories that produce EVs, graphics cards, robots, and more. Copper's the most vigorous root, tying every flower, from tech to finance, into a weather-worthy bed. Meanwhile, the crowds go for gold and sleep on copper.

That completes our garden with 10 flowers. It's a diversified flowerbed, but the flowers correlate in the big picture: Tech drives money movement, which benefits exchanges, banks, and processors; copper powers tech, which drives Bitcoin adoption.  
Your goal is to find and build your garden. Think up different bigger pictures with other sectors and roles. Correlating these assets keeps the garden strong through chaos and self-reinforces one another.

To review, we have the following:  
Stock exchange  
Crypto Exchange  
Bank  
Payment processor   
Gambling  
Ai / EV / Robots  
Semiconductors (Graphics cards)  
Real estate   
Bitcoin  
Copper

Now that we have planted our garden, let's examine the weather and its meaning. We will learn to read the weather and see when storms are coming or clearing. In part 2, you will set a simple EMA indicator, learn how to interpret the weather, and tend to the flowers in our garden.

I bought a decent amount as a naive noob and jumped on the PEPE degen bandwagon like many did.  Made a few hundred buying and selling it before entering a holding position. Shortly after as I heavily researched crypto and the market daily I realized that meme coins are primarily a lost cause and purely degenerate gambling. All this being said, I’m considering cutting my losses( a significant amount to me) and moving on. I’m not sure I see PEPE making it through the bear market. Just looking for the opinions of some more experienced crypto traders. I am open to any advice and I’m not convinced on selling or holding at this time. I do not need this money.

So im a first time poster here. 

I invested into Crypto Mid Dec 2024, when everything seemed like it would keep going up! (Learnt that the hard way). 

I put in 25k, as 5k each into the following:

ONDO
NEAR
RENDER
SEI
AERODROME

it kept going lower and lower so to mitigate i thought ill DCA, so i put 15k in extra, 5k more each into ONDO, NEAR and AERO. 

Right now, on my 40k investment, im sat on 20k. Im really worried because i took a long time to save this from my 9-5 but blown it very quick. Im still holding on, hoping that due to the money supply apparently increasing, and potentially better macro environment, that it can go back up to 40k.

Is it true that as long as i dont sell i dont loose, because even if i wait years, surely the price will go back up high (i could even look to rotate some of these coins to perhaps top 10 ones)…",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1j82qfe/down_50_in_my_first_bull_run_advice_needed/,109,0,0,,positive

1jacvu1,Applying Elliott Wave Analysis to Pi Network: A Swing Trader's Perspective,rzc24defi,1,0,2025-03-13 14:12:10,"If you have been observing the price of Pi for the last three weeks, you will see an unusual price volatility. It has experienced significant fluctuations since its launch, with prices ranging from a low of $0.6157 to a high of $2.99. ​

Applying EWP, given the limited data, any analysis should be considered tentative and preliminary.

For swing traders like me, caution is of utmost importance. I have been reminding myself not to commit the mistake of taking my analysis as something certain that would make me do all out. No problem if you are not trading on borrowed money.

In my case, Pi gave me a $668.00 or PHP 38,319.00 capital plus the 300 Pi I have been holding since the launch, so the fear of losing money is minimal. I started with nothing in this network, so there is nothing to lose except the four years I spent clicking that lightning icon every 24 hours.

In conclusion, if we compare the current chart of Pi to that of the overall picture of Elliott Wave Theory with higher waves like minor, intermediate, and primary, we could say that since Pi has now just completed minute wave 2, a potential minute wave 3 rally is underway. We could not even see that minute wave 3 in [the overall picture](https://peakd.com/hive-173575/@rzc24-nftbbg/applying-elliott-wave-analysis-to-pi-network-a-swing-traders-perspective-f5y), for the lowest wave below is a minor wave 1 with a time frame of several weeks to a few months.

1jaf07e,I Made a Website to Monitor BTC & ETH ETF Flow with 0 Coding Experience,One_Athlete3271,2,6,2025-03-13 15:44:33,"Hey r/CryptoMarkets ,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. After months of being frustrated trying to find the right place to track crypto ETF flows (without relying on scattered Twitter posts and random charts), I decided to build something myself.

**💡 Why I Made Thi**s

Institutional investment in crypto is growing, and ETFs are a major driver of capital flow. But tracking inflows and outflows isn’t easy. Most of the data is buried in reports or shared sporadically on Twitter.

I wanted a clean, real-time dashboard that makes it easy to see and track trends over time. Whether you’re a trader, investor, or just an internet cat wanting to see how institutional money is moving, this tool can help.

The other interesting item of note here is I have 0 coding experience. As of 2 week ago, I had never written a line of code in my life. This is entirely built through AI Tools Like Cursor and ChatGPT, which is amazing for the community, it was pretty inspiring to me that now anything is literally possible. So if you have an idea build it, if I can build something, I promise anyone can!

**📊 Key Feature**s

✅ Live data updates on ETH ETF flows  
✅ Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF inflow/outflow trends  
✅ Breakdown of ETF flows by specific ETFs

**💬 Looking for Feedback**!

The tool is 100% free and always will be, and I’d love your input:

• What features would be most useful to you?

1jcukge,No one blockchain is going to win,CunningStunt_1,32,54,2025-03-16 20:13:42,"In its current iteration, the blockchain landscape is like the internet pre-TCP/IP. 

What does that mean? 

Prior to the 1980's (Pre TCP/IP) the internet wasn't one network. It was several individual islands; ARPANET, Merit Network, CYCLADES, X.25 (public data networks), UUCP and Usenet. 

These isolated islands of information could not interact. You could not move files from Merit Network to a machine on Usenet. Well, not without sweat, panic and sometimes tears and a lot of tapes. 

Probably sounds familiar if you have ever tried to reliably bridge from Arb to Sol.

Majority of these networks still exist and operate. You may have interacted with one recently. But you wouldn't know it. 

TCP(transmission Control protocol)/IP(Internet protocol) bridged these isolated networks to form the internet we know and use today (after a few years and the release of IPv4). 

It became a 'base layer' that is responsible addressing interfaces and routing data across the island networks. 

Essentially it became meaningless what original network you operated on. 

I expect blockchain to develop in the same manner. 

A protocol will be released that will handle all the messaging and data transfer between blockchains in a decentralised manner. 

A new type of smart contract will be built on top of this protocol that will be able to interact with multiple networks in one transaction. You will pay for gas in USDC (or whatever stable), the smart contract will do the required swaps for gas tokens automatically (much like how metamask does with Ethereum). 

Layer 1 blockchains will become like ARPANET and Usenet. Still used, but no one knows that they are. 

I think the protocol that will do all this is already released.

1jd6rj0,Bitcoin compare to GME,Kindly-Economics-214,0,3,2025-03-17 07:02:15,"Bitcoin vs. GME: Why This Short Squeeze Won’t Succeed

The 2021 GameStop (GME) short squeeze was a legendary battle in financial history, forcing hedge funds into massive losses. Now, some traders are attempting to recreate the GME short squeeze in the Bitcoin market, aiming to liquidate a $380 million short position held by a major whale. However, the outcome this time may not be the same. Why?

1. Market Cap Difference: Manipulation is Much Harder
	•	GME’s market cap before the squeeze: ~$1.3 billion
	•	Bitcoin’s current market cap: ~$1.5 trillion

GME had a small market cap, allowing coordinated retail buying to push the stock price up rapidly and force short sellers into liquidation. But Bitcoin’s market cap is over 1,000 times larger than GME’s at the time. Even if retail traders unite to drive up Bitcoin’s price, their impact will be far weaker than in the GME squeeze.

2. Liquidity & Market Structure Differences

Stock markets have limited trading hours, and GME’s trading was even restricted on platforms like Robinhood, leading to extreme price volatility. In contrast, Bitcoin trades 24/7, has much greater liquidity, and deeper market depth. This makes it far more difficult for a social media-driven movement to force a price surge.

3. Wall Street Has Learned Its Lesson

After the GME event, hedge funds and institutional investors adapted. In the crypto market, they now hedge their positions, scale out of trades strategically, and manage risk more effectively. They won’t be caught off guard so easily this time.

Conclusion: GME Was an Exception, Squeezing Bitcoin Won’t Work

GME’s short squeeze succeeded because of its small market cap, high short interest, and low liquidity, allowing retail traders to take control. But Bitcoin is too big, too liquid, and already dominated by institutional players. A retail-driven short squeeze is unlikely to recreate the same miracle.

This is not GME 2.0, but rather an uneven battle—a clash between retail traders and institutions. But this time, the institutions are in a much stronger position.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jd6rj0/bitcoin_compare_to_gme/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

**Step 1:** When Bitcoin is dumping, this is the moment to evaluate the strength of all cryptocurrencies and their potential for rising.

**Step 2:** Wait for about 15 minutes and check which one has bounced more than the others.

**Step 3:** Perform a small technical analysis (TA) to identify resistance and support levels. Check if this coin has any resistance coming up.

Altcoins have failed and Bitcoin is absorbed into the traditional system. Long term holders have won, the rest has lost",GrumpyScroogy,453,220,2025-03-18 22:02:43,"When i first heard about Bitcoin in late 2012 ($8/12 range) it INSTANTLY clicked for me. Why pay a ridiculous Paypal fee when you can just buy some bitcoin and send it directly to the other person worldwide. It was a nobrainer.

Along with each cycle came a wave of altcoins, every cycle more and more. The older i have become and the more cycles i have seen each one became more ridiculous. We went from cryptokitties to nft's to full meme coin casino. Every cycle the promises have become bigger and more ridiculous. And more and more bad faith actors have jumped onboard of the train.

**Its time to face some harsh truths in my opinion that many here refuse to see.**

* **Bitcoin has failed its intended purpose, but has a place in the finance world that gives it value**. 99% doesnt use it to send money P2P. Its absorbed into ETF form and used as a speculative asset where only the $$$ value matters. It being a form of hard money is the only savior in the narrative left and even that is becoming a thin line. At this point its just a tech asset following the broad market.
* **Bitcoin wont make you rich anymore,** **and thats exactly why people load up more and more risk in form of casino altcoins each cycle:** The early days are over, diminishing returns are kicking in hard. It speaks for itself when measured from peak to peak. I have stocks that did better than my Bitcoin DCA I bought at end of 2022 (16/17k range).
   * First cycle: $32 --> $1242 (39x)
   * Second cycle $1242 --> $19796 (16x)
   * Third cycle $19796 --> 68990 (3.5x)
   * Current $68990 --> 110k (1.6x)
   * **Bottom to peak shows the same diminishing returns** (544x | 100x | 20x | 7x)
      * I have no clue why people assume bitcoin will reach 300/500k this cycle.
* **Trump brings a huge systemic risk to crypto/bitcoin, even if it outlives his term/life**: Altcoins literally got saved by Trump's announcement end '24. They were already bleeding out. Bitcoins current cycle was probably accelerated because of it. ***The market priced in perfection***\*\*.\*\* (Perfect ETF's / world reserve etc. the whole package) But it all came crashing down when Trump showed his true colors. When he released his own coin all red flags should have gone up. He doesnt really care about crypto, he cares about his own wallet, ego and power. And that is problematic, cause even if bitcoin is not controlled by Trump, YOU GUYS made him the posterboy as ""pro crypto president"". And now the rest of the world gets to see what that means. Why you applauded a pro-crypto president like him to begin with baffles me. USA is getting dismantled and you all think he wont take crypto a peg down with him?
* **MSTR/Saylor is a huge risk:** Speaks for itself. Very cool to link a factsheet with 80 companies holding bitcoin, but its pretty bleak. And i just dont trust a dude who has blown up his company in the dot com bubble and now attaches his entire company to shilling Bitcoin. Its not organic adoption. Yes you can fault me on this point, its a gut feeling. Same way Elon turned out to be a \*\*\*\*\*\*. Crypto bro's got used to get votes / popularity. Now people burn cars from his brand.
* **99.99% Altcoins are garbage:** Yes in a few weeks or months people will come here to write dumb messages to tell me how wrong i was cause they made a nice 300% return on the weekly with SafePepe420xxxMoon coin. That doesnt mean you are investing. Go take a look in the waybackmachine and see the top 50 coins in 2017 / 2021. If you think you can pick the next blue chip altcoin, good luck. You cant. Especially not with the millions being pumped out yearly now.
* **Social media is getting fragmented more, this halts adoption**: Social media was a great tool to have new people get involved with new ideas. But now its turning into a very splintered / fragmentated landscape where everybody is screaming in their own room. Unable to leave that part almost without doing quite some effort. This halts adoption and at this point most crypto places are just bag holders screaming to other bag holders. Innovative content is lost in the sea of junk.

Disclaimer: I will still hold Bitcoin, and will buy deeper downturns. But the gravy train is officially over. Bitcoin wont be the golden boy anymore. ITS UP 18% since the peak from 2021 after holding for 3+ years. It didnt even outpace inflation during that time....

I will begin with the local price action if you wanna read the prove it will come later:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/AIDBwO4e/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AIDBwO4e/)

quote from twitter from 1h ago:  
if Ethereum doesnt reject here it really can just omega blast because all significant resistances above in the local range are already tested. right now most LOCAL support that you wanna hold is 1990.   
this whole zone from here to 2100 is resistance tho so dont expect this to break easily. FOMC and the days after probably gives us some fuckery here  
The main thing again is closing the weekly above where we are at right now (2020) is the most important thing for the bulls. not just Eth bulls, crypto in general.   
Also i thought about it again and BTC not going to 70k might be a good thing. 70k was way too easy.

**Ok now how I predicted this dump:**

I was one of the few people who were constantly bearish on Crypto and especially ETH after it failed to pump with the new year beginning. In hindsight its probably obvious because of ""trump the scammer"" fucking everyone over.I knew stuff is fishy the day $TRUMP coin was released and I saw some questionable stuff happening [https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1881102238204166411?t=IB23al9GvOk765leFpvlug&s=19](https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1881102238204166411?t=IB23al9GvOk765leFpvlug&s=19)   
I shorted $TRUMP immediately with low leverage while it was still around 50-60. [https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1881101710963454208?t=iXm9LaXt6GTgEX730rg8TA&s=19](https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1881101710963454208?t=iXm9LaXt6GTgEX730rg8TA&s=19)

BTC and ETH were trickier:

if you really wanna follow it perfectly go and scroll down my timeline, its not THAT far..

for ETH i urge you to go here [https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1887471660166426909](https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1887471660166426909) and click on every quoted tweet. this was after the big liquidation slide and even after that I said it will go lower,while most people thought that this strong bounce is a sign for a bottom. It IS, BUT making a new low first made more sense. clicking the quoted tweets will bring you back to end of january when i started to say ETH will dump. It gets a bit complicated and technical. these are just some where I was bearish on ETH. Did many comments like this for ETH and also BTC 

[https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1885899793328644285](https://x.com/iDr3amEU/status/1885899793328644285) .clicking through this one will bring you to some BTC analysis (i literally analyzed the 1 minute tf when BTC was failing to gain 106k on JAN 31.. and said it will goo to 92 and bounce there (92k was the bottom of the big liquidation candle). 

**What I really want you to take away** ,because its fairly simple to see even as a novice, is too look at High time frame candle closes. I mentioned it every sunday night how BTC,as well as ETH closed the weekly candles lower. This is how marketmakers print charts to create a trend reversal. I know it sounds crazy but I am 100% certain it is like this. In some cases a close gets pushed to a certain level in the last hours, its very telling sometimes. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/gyBScSBF/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gyBScSBF/) 

Thats also why I am looking again how ETH will close this current weekly. we CAN bottom here but this pump already did what it needed to. to create *""the""* bottom more things need to happen. Accumulating here for 2 weeks was the first step, now we need to hold higher lows and get nice weekly closes.

I've been in crypto since 2017 and have seen almost everything there is in crypto so I'm qualified to give you advice.

1. You will never make money trading crypto. Just hold it. That course you're looking at with the guy with a rented Lambo telling you he can help you make a living by trading crypto doesn't work. 

2. Buy Bitcoin. Start with Bitcoin. 

3. Don't buy any crypto that doesn't do anything. 
I'll be more specific. Most cryptos don't do nothing.
XRP does nothing. ADA does nothing. 
If it doesn't do anything without hype attached to it don't buy it. 
Ethereum is needed for transactions on the ETH network. See that's something. If ETH transactions increase then potentially ETH will go up. Easy. 

XMR is the only proof of work privacy coin. If you think people will want a private network then perhaps XMR will appreciate in value.

I don't own either. I'm just teaching you what to look for. 

Most cryptos that people talk about have hype and marketing behind them. Things like Bera, SUI, Kas, ADA are just hype machines. Buy something that's been around for a while and the hype is over. If they actually do something (like really do something) then there's a good chance it will go up. 

If all your friends are talking about it, then its already over.

1jgbvy1,Why You Should Think Twice Before Selling Your Pi Coins,fcky3ah,0,1,2025-03-21 08:14:26,"Let’s talk about something important for all Pi Network miners out there. If you’re mining Pi, chances are you’ve heard people say, “Once we can transfer our Pi coins, I’m selling mine right away!” But hang on a second—have you really thought this through? A lot of miners don’t fully understand how cryptocurrency works, and that could lead to some big regrets down the road. Let’s break it down in simple terms.

The Problem: Selling Too Soon

Here’s the thing: many Pi miners are new to the crypto world. That’s not a bad thing, but it means they might not realize what they’re holding. Once Pi coins become transferable, some people will sell their coins immediately—probably for a low price. Why? Because they don’t know the potential value Pi could have in the future.

This is where experienced crypto investors (you know, the OGs) come in. They’re waiting for people to sell their Pi cheap. They’ll buy it up, hold onto it for a few years, and then cash in big when the value skyrockets. Meanwhile, the early sellers will be left thinking, “Why did I sell so soon?”

Why Holding Pi Coins Could Be Smarter

Let’s look at why holding onto your Pi coins instead of selling them right away might be a better idea:

It Could Be Worth A Lot More Later: Just look at Bitcoin. Back in the day, people sold it for a few bucks. Now? It’s worth thousands. Pi could follow a similar path as the network grows and more people start using it.

Demand Will Likely Go Up: As more people join the Pi Network, the coins you’re mining now could become harder to get. When demand goes up and supply stays limited, the value usually increases.

Real-World Use Cases: Pi isn’t just a random coin. The team behind it is building an ecosystem where you can actually use Pi for payments, apps, and more. As these use cases expand, the coin’s value could grow.

Learn From Bitcoin’s History: Early Bitcoin miners who sold too soon missed out on life-changing money. Those who held on? They’re millionaires now.

What the Crypto Pros Are Doing

Let me tell you what the experienced crypto folks are planning. They’re not rushing to sell their Pi coins. Instead, they’re waiting for people who don’t know any better to sell cheap. Then they’ll scoop up those coins, hold them for a few years, and cash out when the price goes way up. It’s a classic move in the crypto world.

What You Should Do as a Pi Miner

If you’re mining Pi, here’s some advice to think about:

Don’t Rush to Sell: Take your time. Think about what your Pi coins could be worth in a few years, not just what they’re worth today.

Learn About Crypto: Spend some time understanding how cryptocurrency works and why patience is so important. You don’t have to be an expert, but a little knowledge can go a long way.

Think Long-Term: Imagine what your Pi coins could do for you in 2-3 years. Selling now might get you some quick cash, but holding could change your life.

Be Part of the Ecosystem: Instead of just thinking about selling, look into how you can use Pi in the real world. The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes.

Final Thoughts

Here’s the bottom line: Pi has the potential to be something big. But if you sell your coins the moment they’re available, you might miss out on the real value. Don’t let the OG crypto investors be the only ones who benefit. Be smart, be patient, and think about the future. Your Pi coins could be worth way more than you realize.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jgbvy1/why_you_should_think_twice_before_selling_your_pi/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

Look at the tariffs against Canada and Europe — they’re not just random moves or negotiating tactics. These disruptions hit traditional markets and fiat corridors hard, shaking confidence and subtly redirecting interest toward crypto accumulation — but not for the public. For his inner circle.

Wouldn’t be surprised if he tipped Musk, David Sacks, and a few other close allies — giving them time to hedge (short/puts) Tesla stock and rotate capital into Bitcoin and select altcoins, ahead of moves that would tank equities and spike volatility. That’s insider trading 3.0, with geopolitical theater as the backdrop.

And let’s not forget what happened with the tweet about ADA, XRP and SOL that Sunday afternoon — low liquidity window, suspicious price movement, and zero follow-up from regulators or big players. It reeks of coordinated playbooks. They know when the liquidity dries up and how to game it. All while the average investor thinks “Trump is pro-crypto.” Nah. He’s pro-**him**.

Crypto markets under Trump won’t thrive — they’ll get squeezed, baited, and dumped on. The only people who’ll come out ahead are the ones who got the wink and the phone call. Retail will be left chasing narratives while friends exit through the backdoor using trusts in the Cayman Islands.

1jh5vda,I Tracked My Stolen XRP and Uncovered a Massive Laundering Operation. Law Enforcement Still Won’t Help.,Socks4334,1565,536,2025-03-22 10:55:20,"
I’m a U.S. combat veteran and small business owner. A week ago, 16,999 XRP was stolen from my wallet in a targeted attack. I didn’t wait for someone to save me—I spent days tracing every single transaction through the XRP Ledger, documenting exactly how my funds were laundered.

What I found was far bigger than just my theft.

I’ve uncovered a multi-layered, international laundering operation involving high-volume wallets, advanced asset obfuscation tactics, and multiple exchanges—all still active today. One of the wallets my funds passed through has moved hundreds of millions of XRP, and continues to receive funds from other suspected thefts.

I compiled everything: timestamps, wallet flows, exchange destination tags, laundering patterns. It’s all packaged into a full forensic report that any law enforcement cybercrime unit could run with immediately.

And yet—nothing.
No response from the FBI.
No follow-up from the Secret Service.
No action from state or federal law enforcement, despite multiple reports, emails, and IC3 submissions.
The only person who even called me back was my local police officer—who confirmed the wallet trail I already found.

I did the job FOR them. I tracked the stolen funds. I mapped the laundering network. I exposed a criminal system operating in plain sight on public blockchains. And law enforcement is still sitting on their hands.

This isn’t just about my 16,999 XRP anymore. This is about the fact that if I can prove this from my desk with no budget and no subpoena power—then they sure as hell can too.

I’m putting this out here because if you’ve been hit, you’re not alone. If you’ve been ignored, you’re not crazy. And if you think the system doesn’t care about cybercrime victims unless it makes headlines—well, I’m starting to believe it too.

I’m not done. I will keep pushing. And I’ll share everything I uncover until someone finally listens.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1jh5vda/i_tracked_my_stolen_xrp_and_uncovered_a_massive/,1565,1,1,XRP,neutral

1jjuh5y,Ripple to Retain $75 Million From SEC As the XRP Lawsuit Enters Final Stage,coinfanking,5,1,2025-03-25 21:11:18,"
Ripple has officially settled its legal battle with the SEC, with the agency returning $75 million of a previous fine.


Ripple now has the ability to sell XRP tokens to institutional investors, potentially boosting liquidity and partnerships.

“Last week, the SEC agreed to drop its appeal without conditions. Ripple has now agreed to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will keep $50 million of the $125 million fine (already in an interest-bearing escrow in cash), with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request,” he said.

Specifically, this cross-appeal contains two crucial components. First, it involves the $125 million fine. The initial community expectation was that the Commission would forfeit the entirety of this fine. However, it seems that both parties have reached an agreement on this matter.

Another critical ruling in the 2024 decision was that Ripple could not sell XRP to institutional investors. The firm had reportedly been negotiating with the SEC to drop this mandate for weeks.

According to reports, this ruling is also being overturned as part of the agreement. In the long run, the lifted restrictions may have a much larger impact. Now that the SEC will let Ripple sell XRP to institutional investors, it could bring significant liquidity, partnership opportunities, and more.

In particular, this decision may also impact XRP’s status as a security or commodity. The SEC was already considering Ripple’s arguments to declare XRP a commodity, and this move may add further weight to the argument. This would also likely improve XRP ETF approval odds.",https://beincrypto.com/sec-return-fine-in-ripple-xrp-lawsuit/?utm_source=thecryptoapp,5,1,1,XRP,positive

Today, more and more neobanks are offering their users the opportunity to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. There are several reasons for this:

– **Demand creates supply.** Every year, the number of cryptocurrency users is growing, and at the same time, more and more people are considering crypto as an alternative to traditional payment solutions. Neobanks are taking advantage of this opportunity and offering relevant services to meet the needs of their customers.

– **Providing faster and cheaper transactions.** One of the advantages of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries such as traditional banks. As a result, transaction costs and processing speeds are reduced, which contributes to the efficiency of cross-border payments.

– **Transparency and security of the blockchain.** Blockchain technology ensures transparency and high reliability, as each transaction is visible to all network participants and can be verified and confirmed.

– **Portfolio diversification.** Neobanks give users the opportunity to store both fiat and crypto assets, which allows them to diversify their portfolio and manage it through one platform.""

There’s a lot of noise out there claiming the bull market is done. But history and macro conditions say otherwise.  
  
Let’s start with history:

    Cycle           Bottom Price    Top Price     Return (x)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    2011 → 2013     ~$0.30          ~$1,200       3428.5x
    2014 → 2017     ~$238           ~$19,000      79.83x
    2018 → 2021     ~$3,300         ~$69,000      20.9x
    

Each Bitcoin cycle shows diminishing returns — sure — but the pattern isn’t linear, it’s **logarithmic**. That’s a key distinction, making it harder to predict the actual multiple for the next cycle. The **rate of reduction slows over time**, so while we may not see another 20x, we’re still well within range for a **major move**. So far, BTC has reached around **$108k** — a **6.75x from the 2022 bottom (\~$16k)**. Substantial, yes — but **likely not the peak**, for several reasons.

Now look at the current macro setup:

* **Quantitative Easing (QE)** is almost guaranteed to return — possibly **as early as Q2 2025**. And when QE starts, **risk-on assets** like crypto tend to fly.
* The **global M2 money supply** just hit an **all-time high**. Historically, that’s followed by a **rally in risky assets with \~80% probability** — usually with a **3 months lag**.

So here’s the real question:

If we don’t get an euphoric bull market — at least half as wild as the last one — where is all that excess liquidity going to go?

To **Gold? Real Estate?** **or Savings Account?** Come on.  
Bitcoin and crypto are the most asymmetric bets left on the table.

Shouldn’t the tariffs be the perfect time for cryptocurrencies to shine?,SWEDISHFUCKUP,12,95,2025-04-03 10:12:19,"The Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on all countries could serve as a major catalyst for the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tariffs create economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and weaken fiat currencies, making decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies more attractive as alternative stores of value and mediums of exchange.

1. Weakening of Fiat Currencies and Inflationary Pressure

Tariffs function as a tax on imports, raising the cost of goods for consumers and businesses. When these costs rise, inflation can follow, particularly in countries reliant on imported goods. As central banks attempt to counteract inflation with monetary policy, fiat currencies can lose purchasing power. Investors and everyday consumers may seek refuge in Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it a hedge against inflation similar to gold.

In nations that experience devaluation due to retaliatory tariffs or economic instability, citizens may turn to cryptocurrencies to preserve their wealth. This has already been seen in countries like Argentina and Venezuela, where economic turmoil led to a surge in crypto adoption. If Trump’s tariffs destabilize multiple economies, a similar pattern could emerge on a global scale.

2. Capital Flight and Store of Value Appeal

When governments impose broad tariffs, businesses and investors may look for ways to protect their assets from currency depreciation and economic slowdown. Cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized and borderless way to move capital. Unlike traditional financial systems, which governments can regulate and restrict, Bitcoin and other digital assets allow for quick and secure wealth transfers without intermediaries.

Historically, economic uncertainty has driven Bitcoin price spikes, as seen during the U.S.-China trade war of 2019. If global businesses and wealthy investors anticipate financial turbulence due to tariffs, they may allocate more capital into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT or USDC to avoid currency risks.

3. Decentralization as a Hedge Against Government Policies

One of the core appeals of cryptocurrencies is their independence from government control. Tariff policies are a form of economic intervention that can be unpredictable and politically motivated. Businesses dealing with international trade may find it increasingly difficult to operate under shifting policies and higher costs. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins and Bitcoin, offer an alternative payment system that is not subject to trade restrictions or government-imposed financial barriers.

This could accelerate the adoption of crypto as a preferred method for cross-border transactions. Companies seeking to bypass trade friction could use Bitcoin’s Lightning Network or stablecoins on blockchain networks like Solana or Ethereum to settle payments quickly and with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems.

4. Increased Interest from Retail and Institutional Investors

As economic uncertainty rises, retail investors and institutions alike may look for alternative investment opportunities. Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” has historically performed well during economic downturns. The more uncertainty tariffs create, the greater the demand for assets that exist outside the traditional financial system. Institutional investors, who have already begun embracing Bitcoin, may accelerate their adoption, leading to higher prices and broader acceptance.

Weiss also disputed the notion that bitcoin’s behavior mirrors the equity market, predicting a sharp break in correlation. “Bitcoin’s recent correlation with equities won’t last. A divergence is coming and it won’t be subtle,” he opined. His message reflects a broader view emerging among bitcoin advocates that the digital asset is maturing into an independent asset class, capable of acting as a hedge against systemic economic and political shocks.


This sentiment was echoed by Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software intelligence firm Microstrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), which recently rebranded as Strategy. On April 4, Saylor offered similar comments about bitcoin’s divergence from risk-on assets. “Bitcoin trades like a risk asset short term because it’s the most liquid, salable, 24/7 asset on Earth. In times of panic, traders sell what they can, not what they want to. Doesn’t mean it’s correlated long-term—just means it’s always available,” he explained.


Weiss and Saylor, along with many others in the crypto industry, also drew attention to bitcoin’s insulation from protectionist trade policies, especially as President Donald Trump reimposed tariffs on a large number of countries. “There are no tariffs on bitcoin,” Weiss noted. The statement has become a rallying point for digital asset supporters who argue that bitcoin’s lack of borders and centralized control shields it from the types of economic constraints affecting traditional investments. Proponents argue that bitcoin’s design and independence make it increasingly appealing in a climate shaped by tariffs, trade wars, and monetary intervention.",https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-poised-for-violent-decoupling-from-global-markets-expert-says/,8,1,1,BTC,neutral

Supply on exchanges = ammo for selling.
No ammo? No sell pressure.

**Buy when there's blood in the water. Be greedy when others are fearful.**

*My Coingecko Portfolio tracker has crashed twice tonight from site overload.*   
*The Crypto market is down 7.5%*  
*The blood is starting to flow.*

The way to approach this bear market, and plan ahead is to set limit orders, dollar cost average, and wait for the recovery. You should be prepared to leave your money in the market for **four years** in a worst case.

To outperform global index trackers and stock indices you only need to make *10%* per year, if you get *40%* profit in the worst case projection of *four years*, you'll have roughly hit that goal.   
You'll have done even better if you make good use of staking rewards.

If you buy ETH at $1600 and sell at $2300 you'll easily hit this goal. **That's a rather conservative target!**

Shorting the market can be risky for new traders and often requires understanding safe leverage, it may also go badly if there's a random good news event (eg Trump tweets all tariffs are gone lmao).   
If in doubt, take long positions only.

My own positions:  
I brought Sol at $110, Dot at $3.95 and ETH at $1600.  
I have an additional, larger, limit order set on ETH at $1300.   
Depending how long this market continues, I'll be regularly buying ETH at any level below $1600, and keeping a close eye on SOL.

If you don't know what to buy it's hard to go wrong with BTC or ETH.

whose job is to take all the money put into them by making many incredibly fast and efficient transactions across the array of buying options. I think they created funnels to extract money. So we see the price drop when musk tweets to buy solana even when transactions are high. They can see sell orders as well and can beat them buy .0001 percent before yours gets triggered. So they skim. And poeple who do well with crypto understand they are playing the system and the people not the value. 


That being said with bitcoin going down it’s safe to say that the algos are afoot. 


My theories:

They are baiting buys to increase the money supply. 


They are getting liquid for some reason.

As I try to game the game, I wonder why they would be getting liquid. It could be that the big whales are going to pump somewhere. Or that they need the money for other buys in this down economy (which makes a lot of sense)

Potentials

Are they going to try to save Tesla? 

Pump a new coin?

Manipulated discount entry into a new etf product to be released? 

Creating instability fears for regulatory framing?

Are they pre-positioning funds knowing a liquidity hub is coming? 

Buying distressed products like real estate. 


It’s time to hunt - because this is a special time in history. By observing what happens next we can track algo activity. 


Watch the wallets. They set up for something that is going to happen tomorrow.

1jxqi7q,Could Jasmy coin reaches $30 and become the future new Cryptocurrencies price engine !! ??,No_Influence_3685,0,2,2025-04-12 20:24:00,"Hey Redditers friends;

Theoretical Possibility: Yes, theoretically, the price of any asset traded on an open market, including JasmyCoin, could reach any level, including $30 CAD. Price is determined by the intersection of supply and demand at any given moment. If demand were to massively outstrip the available supply being offered for sale on exchanges, the price would rise. In an extreme, hypothetical scenario with near-infinite demand and virtually no supply offered for sale below $30, the price could technically reach that point.

Required Market Cap: As calculated previously, using a circulating supply of approximately 49.44 billion JASMY, a price of $30 CAD would imply a market capitalization of roughly C$1.53 Trillion.
Scale Comparison: C$1.53 Trillion is an enormous market cap. As of recent data, Bitcoin's market cap is around C$2.3 Trillion, and Ethereum's is around C$260 Billion. Reaching C$1.53 Trillion would make JasmyCoin significantly larger than Ethereum and place it in the same league as Bitcoin's current valuation.
Required Price Increase: JasmyCoin's current price is roughly C$0.02. Reaching C$30 represents an approximate 1500x (or 150,000%) increase. Its documented all-time high is around C$6.92, meaning $30 CAD is over 4 times higher than its peak historical price.

Necessary Conditions (Highly Improbable): For such a price to be reached, it would require a confluence of extraordinary and unprecedented events, such as:

Revolutionary technological breakthroughs unique to Jasmy.
Massive, global adoption of its specific IoT data platform, becoming an indispensable standard.
An enormous influx of capital specifically into JASMY, driven by unparalleled utility or speculation.
Possibly a drastic, unforeseen reduction in circulating supply available for trading.
A complete shift in market sentiment making Jasmy more valuable than almost all other established crypto projects.

### less don't forget the highest adoption by Jasmy strongest community warriors;)

Also, selling sats is never a good idea, because the price may skyrocket after you sell.

That’s changing — fast. Visa leads the charge, and stablecoins are the secret sauce powering this payment revolution.

# Why Should You Care About Stablecoins?

Let’s break it down. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real-world money like the US dollar. That means they’re steady — no wild swings like Bitcoin. And now, with Visa jumping in, stablecoins are about to become part of your daily life.

# Visa’s Big Move: Making Crypto Spendable

Visa isn’t just talking about crypto — they’re making it work for everyone. Their new Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) is set to launch soon. What does that mean for you?

* Banks will be able to issue and manage stablecoins directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
* You’ll see more crypto cards that let you spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted.
* Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Imagine paying for groceries or booking flights with stablecoins — no extra steps, no confusing conversions. That’s the future Visa is building.

# Real Numbers, Real Growth

Here’s what’s wild: crypto card spending with Visa already hit over $1 billion in just six months a couple of years ago. Today, that number is even bigger. Platforms like WhiteBIT’s Nova card have processed over a million transactions. And the stablecoin market? It’s exploding — over $200 billion in circulation, and experts say we could see $300 billion by the end of this year.

# What’s In It for You?

* Speed: Payments settle almost instantly, even across borders.
* Stability: No more worrying about crypto price swings.
* Global Access: Spend your crypto at over 70 million merchants worldwide.

Businesses are loving it, too. On platforms like BitPay, stablecoins now make up a quarter of all payment volume, especially for big transactions.

# But Wait — What About Risks?

Visa’s reputation brings trust, but there are still hurdles. Regulations are evolving, and not everyone understands how stablecoins work. But as Visa partners with more crypto platforms and rolls out stablecoin-linked cards, expect education and security to improve.

# The Bottom Line

Visa is turning stablecoins from a crypto buzzword into a real-world payment tool. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast or just want faster, cheaper payments, this revolution is coming to your wallet sooner than you think.

Are you ready to pay with crypto like it’s cash? Drop your thoughts below!

Key Takeaways:

* Visa’s stablecoin push will make crypto payments as easy as using your debit card.
* Stablecoins offer speed, stability, and global reach.
* The payment landscape is changing — don’t get left behind.

Want more tips on how to ride the next wave of digital payments? Stick around — this is just the beginning.

1k38yzz,"How to actually buy, hold and trade altcoins",wraithoffaith,25,39,2025-04-19 23:14:09,"So you wanna buy an altcoin you believe will 2x or 4x your portfolio in a year, or maybe you're still holding onto a coin that has dropped 20% percent since you bought it and don't wanna sell because you're in too deep and want it to go back to the price it was when you bought it before you sell. Whatever the case, here we can see the first fatal flaw that most altcoin traders and buyers fall for and that's coin loyalty.

You should never ever be loyal to any altcoin no matter how cool the icon or name is. You can have favorites sure, LTC is my favorite coin but I haven't held it in a long time. If you become loyal to a coin then you risk holding a coin that is doing more damage than good simply because you like the coin. I have around 10 altcoins I keep track of but only ever hold 1-3 different coins at a time. My reason for picking the coins that I do is based on their BTC and ETH charts, not the USD. This is where we see the 2nd biggest mistake most altcoin traders fall for which is looking at Altcoins vs USD.

Every altcoin has both a BTC and ETH value, this value is what actually determines the USD value of an altcoin. The only USD value that matters is that of BTC and ETH, every other coin you should be looking at their BTC and ETH pairs. Why you may be asking? Because it is as I said, every altcoin has a btc and eth value, that's why exchanges let you trade any altcoin for btc. Let's say BTC is in an uptrend and your altcoin's USD value is going up but it's going up less in % than BTC. The reason that's happening is because as bitcoin is going up, your altcoin is going down in bitcoin value. It is worth less and less bitcoin as bitocin goes up. You would be much better off holding bitcoin than that altcoin even tho that alt is going up in USD

That means that when bitcoin is going up, you want to be holding altcoins that are doing better than bitcoin is. You do that by trading the altcoin with bitcoin instead of USD. An altcoin should be increasing your BTC value as it goes up, because if bitcoin is worth more and more you want an altcoin that's giving you more bitcoin. Check your altcoin's BTC value and if it's low and continuing to drop especially as bitcoin is going up, you should really consider selling that coin. So in conclusion, don't be loyal to any coin, don't worry about an altcoin's USD value because if bitcoin is going up and the altcoin's btc value is going up then you know for certain the USD value will go up.

ETH/BTC is gonna flip soon so ETH will be going up more than bitcoin, and when it does you wanna be holding altcoins that are doing better than ETH and BTC, thoes are the ones that will give you the +100% increase to your portfolio",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1k38yzz/how_to_actually_buy_hold_and_trade_altcoins/,25,1,1,"BTC, ETH, LTC",positive

1k4kyc9,My friend asked me what shit coin to pick. Here was my advice.,CoffeeHouseInvestor,0,32,2025-04-21 18:36:25,"
If you estimate the potential gains from its current price, remember that the main hype occurred when it was much lower initially. While it's possible for the price to increase 100x to 1000x beyond this point, the market conditions required for that would be unrealistic.  

To assess whether a stock (or cryptocurrency) can reach a certain price, research the necessary market conditions and make a reasonable judgment.  

For example, for Dogecoin to hit a specific price target, it might require something like a 200% increase in trading volume, reaching, say, $50 billion—which, while not impossible, would be highly unlikely. (Note: These are not actual Dogecoin numbers, just an illustration.)

Note that this strategy is being implemented into a trading bot thats why its worded the way it is

Happy to receive constructive criticism like this first id like to say the reason i wont share the bot is due to incompleteness/bugs and lack of thorough testing, i would HATE to share something that hurts people, Id like to share with you what profit/risk management strategies i have implented in the current version, maybe you can help me to understand if my current strategy is efficient at generating profit/managing risk or if I should maybe adjust the strategy

Utilizing large language models, Ive included robust risk management, my risk to reward ratio is designed to be 1:2 with advanced stop loss mechanics designed to avoid panic selling while minimizing risk, my stop loss % = .5 * target profit %, my current target profits at 1.25-2%, when stop loss is reached my bot triggers a protocol to monitor every 60s the position if the position stays between SL% and 2 * SL% it holds for the recovery and stays in the SLP(stop loss protocol) until either A) current price = 2 * SL% or B) price recovers avove SL% ending the SLP
Additionally i utilize live and historical market metrics such as current price trend, liquidity, slippage, volatility etc.. to generate a confidence score of 0-100, the higher the confidence the higher the probability the trade will reach profit targets, how it selects trades is by sparating all coins based on their type category such as List 1, DeFi, Meme etc...it assigns each category a safety rating, of 1 to x, where x equals total number of categories, the safest categories have a threshold for the c-score of 60 in order for the coins within them to be traded, the riskiest categories CST is 85, and that threshold scales linearly across all categories, the bot can make up to 5 trades at a time, choosing coins which meet or exceed the c-score threshold of their category, and chosing from the safest categories first, only using riskier options when the trade cap of 5 is not met.

My profit goals are 1.25 to 2%, when current price is = to or greater than profit goal, bot triggers a short delay before selling, it abalyzes the market conditions for bull indicators, if strong bull indicators are present it until bull indicators diminish or reverse then it sells, if bull indicators are not present it sells immediately to capitalize. Each batch of trades expires after 1hr, when the batch expires any trades not closed due to pnl triggers are immediately closed, this keeps my funds free in sideways markets, if a trade is being held due to the bull indicator logic and would expire/close, it is instead sent to an isolated batch where it can continue riding the bull out, once sent to this batch the bot then uses historical data and compares it with current data, to generate a predicted end price for the bull, when the new batch is prepared it calls on the isolated EBT batch to see what coins are present, it then calls the predicted end price of the bull for those coins and if the delta between current price and projected bull end price is greater than the target profit for that coin, then the new batch is allowed to open parallel position of that coin, else it selects the next best coins.

The details in the bot are slightly more robust bit this gives you a good idea of what Im doing

1k5kqmp,MicroStrategy MSTR Stock Misinformation,sneezydig,4,3,2025-04-22 23:25:01,"I've seen that most people don’t actually understand how MicroStrategy works in a lot of these subs.

Been seeing a lot of posts here and elsewhere that treat MicroStrategy like it’s just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin or a “Bitcoin ETF with upside.” That’s not really what’s actually going on when you buy MSTR.

It’s clear that most people (even bulls) don’t fully get the engine behind this company.

We asked a CFA charter holder to help us walk through it off the books, just to make sure we weren’t missing anything. Their perspective helped clarify a lot.

Since 2020, Strategy (that’s the new name they go by) has been raising capital through common stock, preferred stock, and convertible debt. Not to grow revenue or expand operations but to buy more BTC.

The company is basically converting market optimism and volatility into more Bitcoin on the balance sheet. When investor appetite is strong and the stock is running, they raise. When BTC dips or the market cools, they hold.

It’s a financial structure designed to accumulate assets over time.

They mostly issue convertible debt. These are bonds that can turn into stock if the price goes high enough.

Because of something called convexity, this structure benefits from volatility. When the stock goes up, the bond gains value faster. When it drops, the bond doesn’t fall as hard.

Some institutions take advantage of this by doing delta-neutral trades. They buy the bond and short the stock, so they don’t care where the price goes. They just want movement.

MicroStrategy’s system actually works better when the stock is volatile.

They created an internal metric called BTC Yield. It tracks how much Bitcoin they’re adding compared to how much dilution they’re causing. If BTC Yield is positive, it means they’re accumulating more BTC per share, even while issuing more stock or debt.

And this is the part I think a lot of people miss. You’re not buying “leveraged Bitcoin” when you buy MSTR. You’re buying the *possibility* of future leverage. That only works if they can keep raising money and if BTC keeps rising. If either of those breaks, the premium disappears.

Without volatility, and more directly, new capital, the premium for future leverage will collapse. The question is: *will it happen when Bitcoin is worth $2 trillion, or $200 trillion?*

Strategy is not a pure Bitcoin bet. It’s a bet on volatility and emotion.

This is not about belief in Bitcoin alone. It’s about understanding the vehicle you’re using to gain exposure.

In fact, for many investors, the cleaner and more cost-effective move may be to **simply buy Bitcoin directly**.

We partnered to write a full breakdown of how the model works, not just the Bitcoin angle but the capital structure too. We're not long the stock. Just think people should understand what they’re actually buying.

1k7u9k5,SEC Dismisses Case Against Dragonchain,DRGN_HODLer,1,0,2025-04-25 19:56:48,"From the Dragonchain team:

A Victory for Innovation

In a historic moment for blockchain innovation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dismissed its case against Dragonchain, putting an end to a seven-year-long legal battle that threatened the progress of blockchain and decentralization technology in the United States. This dismissal, with prejudice, ensures that the SEC cannot pursue the same claims again, marking a definitive victory for Dragonchain and the broader blockchain community.
For Dragonchain, this outcome is more than just legal relief—it is a resounding affirmation that its approach to blockchain technology, tokenization, and utility was always on solid ground. With the weight of litigation lifted, Dragonchain is now free to advance its vision of secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain solutions without regulatory uncertainty.
This ruling also sets an important precedent for the industry, signaling that blockchain projects designed as utility-based ecosystems—rather than speculative investments—can and should be recognized for their technological merit rather than being misclassified under outdated securities law.

The Case: A History of the Battle

The SEC first launched its investigation into Dragonchain in February 2018, later filing a formal complaint in 2022. The case revolved around whether the DRGN token, which was introduced in 2017, constituted an unregistered security. Dragonchain maintained from the beginning that DRGN is not a security but a software license token used for access to blockchain-based services.
The legal battle was both costly and time-consuming, with Dragonchain sacrificing millions in legal defense. The dismissal of this case not only clears Dragonchain's name but also marks the first time the SEC has dropped a case against a blockchain token in this manner—a watershed moment for the entire crypto industry.
Dragonchain endured a costly and prolonged legal standoff with the SEC, sacrificing millions in defense of its innovative platform and token model. The recent motion by the SEC to voluntarily dismiss the case against Dragonchain marks an unprecedented moment in crypto history and signals a turning point not only for Dragonchain, but for the broader industry’s fight for clarity and fairness in regulation.
The final dismissal came on April 24th, 2025, a date that will undoubtedly be remembered as a milestone in the fight for fair blockchain regulation.

Dragonchain: ""America’s Blockchain""

Dragonchain’s journey began inside Disney in 2014, where it was originally developed as a private blockchain platform for enterprise use. After proving its effectiveness and flexibility in real-world applications, it was open-sourced in 2016, allowing developers worldwide to build on its unique hybrid blockchain architecture.
Joe Roets, Dragonchain’s founder and Chief Architect, is a seasoned software architect who has worked with organizations such as Disney, Lockheed Martin, the DoD, the FBI, and Coinbase. His deep understanding of security and enterprise solutions led to Dragonchain’s patented approach to scalable, hybrid blockchain networks.
Unlike traditional blockchains, which force users to choose between privacy and decentralization, Dragonchain allows businesses to keep sensitive data private while still securing transactions on public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Dragonchain’s Real-World Impact

Despite the legal battle, Dragonchain continued to build and serve real-world customers, proving its resilience and technological superiority.
Some of its most prominent applications include:
Den.Social – A decentralized social media platform that uses blockchain to reward content creators and eliminate centralized censorship.
DEXX – A tokenized fine art and asset exchange, allowing fractional ownership of high-value assets.
Drakaria – A next-gen blockchain gaming platform using provably fair and verifiable game mechanics.
WBRT (World Blockchain Round Table) – The first-ever DAO-based podcast, where viewers directly govern content and rewards.
Eternal – Free utility to place any information on chain.
These use cases demonstrate that Dragonchain is not just theory—it is a functional and widely adopted blockchain utility platform that is already solving real-world challenges.

By the Numbers: Dragonchain Statistics

Despite facing an SEC lawsuit, Dragonchain has continued to operate, innovate, and grow. The numbers speak for themselves. More than 532 million utility transactions have been executed by thousands of DRGN token users and over 3,200 organizations. All transactions are secured across multiple public blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This showcases Dragonchain’s proven utility, resilience, and reliability as a robust blockchain platform. The network operates with a fully decentralized verification system, ensuring data integrity through multiple independent nodes. Additionally, hundreds of DAOs and governance systems are utilizing Dragonchain for transparent decision-making.
Dragonchain’s ecosystem includes a strong and diverse community of over 39,000 DRGN token holders worldwide. These holders utilize DRGN as a utility token rather than a speculative asset, leveraging it to access Dragonchain’s blockchain services.
Dragonchain’s enterprise-first focus and patented security architecture sets it apart as one of the most innovative blockchain projects in the U.S.

The DRGN Token and Sale Model

A major factor in the SEC’s case was the classification of the DRGN token. Unlike speculative investment tokens, DRGN was modeled as a Tokenized Micro-License (TML) for accessing Dragonchain’s blockchain services​. This token model fundamentally differs from typical cryptocurrencies and redefines how blockchain-based licensing can work.
The patented TML model allows DRGN tokens to function as software licenses rather than securities. Users hold DRGN as a balance and utilize them over time to access various services on the Dragonchain platform.
Dragonchain conducted its token sale in October 2017, exactly one year after Disney open-sourced the original Dragonchain project​. Unlike typical ICOs at that time, which often encouraged speculative investment, Dragonchain designed its sale model to prioritize fairness and accessibility.
Instead of setting a fixed price, the sale was structured so that every participant received DRGN at the exact same price regardless of when they joined. This approach eliminated issues of early investor advantages and price manipulation. The sale ran for an entire month (October 2 – November 2, 2017), allowing people new to blockchain to participate without rushing into a decision.
Dragonchain allocated 55% of the total token supply (433,494,437 DRGN) for the sale, with the remaining tokens reserved for the project’s development, partnerships, and ecosystem growth.
Dragonchain’s approach to blockchain monetization has now been vindicated, proving that tokens can be structured legally and ethically without being unfairly classified as securities.

Dragonchain Innovations and Firsts

Dragonchain has pioneered multiple advancements in blockchain technology that have the potential to reshape industries worldwide. With the SEC case dismissed, Dragonchain is now positioned to advance these innovations and drive the adoption of scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain solutions across industries.
Interchain: Dragonchain’s groundbreaking interoperability system connects businesses and applications to multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other blockchain desired. By enabling seamless interaction between different blockchain networks, Interchain ensures security, flexibility, and efficiency in a way that no other platform has achieved.
Measurable Proof: A patented system that provides verifiable data integrity, ensuring trust and accountability in business processes, supply chains, and digital interactions. This innovation sets a new standard for proving the authenticity of data without revealing sensitive information.
TIME-Based Scalability: Dragonchain leverages the passage of time as a staking mechanism, allowing businesses to scale transaction capacity predictably. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that suffer from congestion and fluctuating fees, TIME-based scalability ensures stable and deterministic costs for enterprises.
Enterprise Smart Contract Orchestration: Unlike rigid smart contracts on other platforms, Dragonchain enables businesses to modify, update, or replace smart contract workflows without disrupting operations. This flexible approach allows enterprises to adapt blockchain applications to evolving business needs.
Multi-Language Smart Contracts: Developers can write smart contracts in familiar programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C#, rather than being forced to use proprietary blockchain languages. This lowers the barrier to blockchain adoption for businesses and developers worldwide.
Provably Fair Selection and System Entropy: Dragonchain ensures transparent, verifiable randomness for applications such as gaming, lotteries, and secure voting systems. This technology guarantees that outcomes cannot be manipulated, fostering trust in decentralized applications.
Smart Contract Gated Data Access: A critical feature for enterprise security, this system allows access to sensitive data only under specific, blockchain-verified conditions. This is particularly important for industries requiring regulatory compliance, such as healthcare, finance, and government operations.
These innovations position Dragonchain as a leader in blockchain technology, offering secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready solutions that extend beyond the capabilities of traditional blockchain networks.

The fight for fair regulation and blockchain innovation is far from over, but today, Dragonchain has won a truly historic battle—one that will inspire countless blockchain projects to stand their ground and push for a freer, fairer, and more innovative digital future. This is a victory for America and the world.
We should therefore recognize the principled leadership and signs of courage from those within the system, striving to correct its course: Chairman Paul Atkins, Commissioner Mark Uyeda, Commissioner Hester Peirce, and a special nod to Jorge Tenreiro for outstanding IT support. May the SEC's Crypto Task Force continue its vital role in turning tides and restoring clarity.
And finally, We extend our sincere thanks to The Walt Disney Company for the trust placed in us to create Dragonchain. Born within your walls, forged in innovation, and inspired by a legacy of imagination and courage — Dragonchain exists because you dared to let us build something new. Thank you for believing in the power of vision, technology, and possibility.
“Around here, however, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward—opening up new doors and doing new things—because we’re curious…and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” — Walt Disney
We’ve never looked back—and we’re not about to start now.

1k83doe,Bitcoin is the “Ultimate Arrow Security” which means it will continue to appreciate due to fundamental economic theory.,68dot164dot57dot219,0,10,2025-04-26 03:17:25,"Bitcoin is a pure state contingent claim that pays off when fiat fails, precisely the Arrow security concept. It delivers extreme purchasing power in a high inflation or sovereign debt crisis state and is worth far less in normal times. That makes Bitcoin a natural hedge. By combining Bitcoin with other assets you can replicate any desired payoff across macroeconomic scenarios.

Rational allocators across corporations, banks, central banks and sovereign wealth funds will adopt Bitcoin once they see it as the foundation of a complete contingent claims portfolio. It is not a speculative gamble; it is the Arrow security for the one state everyone secretly fears.

As an Arrow security, economic theory implies every rational wealth holder should hold some Bitcoin. The only question is what share of their portfolio to allocate, based on their objective function and the probability they assign to the extreme crisis state. Since Bitcoin’s payoff is extreme this means when its price falls, rational actors will buy as soon as their allocations dip below target. This behavior is already visible in recent price action.

Bitcoin’s price itself also signals the market’s assessment of the likelihood of that Arrow payout but also the fraction of participants who have accepted it’s status as an Arrow security. 

Bottom line: as more participants recognize Bitcoin as an Arrow security, its price is unlikely to fall significantly. Prices may plateau for extended periods if there is limited new information on the probability of a large payout.

Only a fundamental and convincing restoration of monetary discipline by fiat governments could cause Bitcoin prices to fall. Anyone who has studied history knows that is unlikely.

This argument rests on Nobel Prize level economic theory that is now widely accepted among central banks and corporate financiers.

Happy Bitcoining. We’ve done it. We have brought sanity and discipline to a multipolar world order.

Exchange Outflows: 1.7% of total BTC supply was moved off exchanges in the past 48 hours, reducing circulating supply and supporting the rally.

ETF Inflows: U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.68 billion in inflows this week, the highest since December 2024, reflecting robust institutional demand.

Community & Social Media Sentiment
Sentiment Shift: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index surged from “Fear” (18) to “Greed” (72) in April, before settling at 60 by April 25, indicating sustained optimism but some cooling off.

Indicators:

RSI: 68 on the daily chart, approaching overbought but not extreme.

Short-Term (April–May 2025):

Targets: $97,000–$100,000 if current momentum holds.

Bullish Scenario: Clearing $100,000 could trigger rapid gains toward $112,000–$115,000.

Bearish Scenario: Failure to hold $93,000 support could lead to a retest of $88,000.

Long-Term (2025 and Beyond):

End-2025 Consensus: $125,000–$135,000 average, with some forecasts as high as $150,000–$170,000.

2030–2035: Some experts predict $452,000–$1,000,000, citing Bitcoin’s finite supply and growing adoption.

Sector Trends & Macro Events
Market Recovery: Bitcoin’s 25% rebound from early April lows has shifted sentiment from fear to greed, supporting broader crypto market optimism.

ETF & Institutional Demand: Strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and renewed whale accumulation are driving the rally.

Macro Correlation: Bitcoin’s price strength is diverging from equities and gold, reinforcing its role as a macro-neutral asset and portfolio hedge.

AI & Crypto Intersection: Increased interest in AI-driven trading bots and AI tokens is correlated with Bitcoin’s rally, with AI-related trading volume rising 7–12%.

Key Takeaways
Bitcoin posted its strongest weekly gain since late 2024, surging past $95,000 on robust whale and institutional demand.

ETF inflows and whale accumulation are key drivers, while social and retail sentiment remains optimistic but is approaching cautionary “greed” levels.

Short-term targets point to $97,000–$100,000, with long-term forecasts ranging from $125,000 to $170,000 for 2025.

Macro trends-especially Bitcoin’s divergence from equities and gold-are reinforcing its appeal as a portfolio hedge and strategic asset.

1k89ov3,5 Common Crypto Mistakes I Wish I Knew When I Started (And How to Avoid Them),Zeus_ymnr,16,17,2025-04-26 10:15:25,"Hi r/Cryptomarket

I’ve been navigating the crypto world for 8years, from the 2017 bull run to the latest DeFi trends. Along the way, I’ve made plenty of mistakes—and seen others make them too. I wanted to share some lessons that might save you time, money, and stress, especially if you’re new to the space or looking to level up.

5 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:
1. Falling for Hype (FOMO): Chasing pumps often leads to buying at the top. Tip: Set clear investment goals and stick to a strategy based on fundamentals, not social media hype.
2. Ignoring Security: I once lost funds to a phishing scam—ouch. Tip: Use a hardware wallet, enable 2FA, and double-check URLs before connecting your wallet.
3. Not Doing Enough Research (DYOR): Blindly investing in a “hot” coin is a recipe for disaster. Tip: Check the project’s whitepaper, team, and GitHub activity. CoinGecko and X posts can be great starting points.
4. Overcomplicating Trading: Leverage and futures can wipe out your portfolio fast. Tip: Start with spot trading and only scale up as you learn.
5. Panic Selling: Market dips are brutal but often temporary. Tip: Zoom out on the charts and focus on long-term trends.

I’m passionate about helping people navigate crypto safely, whether it’s setting up a secure wallet, understanding market cycles, or building a balanced portfolio. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or want personalized guidance, feel free to shoot me a DM—I’d love to chat about your goals and share what I’ve learned.

What’s the biggest mistake you’ve made in crypto, or what’s holding you back right now? Let’s get a discussion going in the comments!

I mainly trade Bitcoin and a few other coins they offer.

A couple of days ago, they suddenly restricted my account — I can’t place orders or withdraw my funds anymore. No warning, no clear explanation.

This is the message I received:

>Dear Trader,

>Thank you for contacting Bybit Customer Support.

>We are sorry to inform you that your account has been involved in a case of market surveillance, with trading activities identified as collusion, which is classified as market manipulation and is strictly forbidden.

>Our analysis shows that your trading patterns are very similar to other clients, indicating coordinated efforts. Specifically, we have detected multiple clients buy and sell specific cryptocurrencies almost nearly simultaneously. These actions match the definition of collusion and disrupt fair market practices.

>Furthermore, such trading patterns result in sudden price changes leading to large scale liquidation on the platform, which does great harm to Bybit's clients.  
Bybit is committed to protect all clients from malicious losses and ensure a fair and transparent trading environment. Thus, we have implemented trading and withdrawal restrictions on your account, effective immediately.

>We are conducting a thorough investigation. If our investigation determines that you are innocent, we will release these restrictions immediately.

>We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this process. Please contact us if you have any questions or require further clarification.

>With warmest regards,

>Bybit Support | Help Center

The thing is — I’m a **single, verified user**, and I’ve often even traded at a loss. Most of my trades are small in size (a few dozen usd mostly 10-20$ with maximal 50-100$). I have no idea how they jumped to ""market manipulation"" from this. I’m not part of any groups, not coordinating with anyone.

It feels like their system just flagged me without real evidence. And worst of all, they haven't provided any way for me to **prove my innocence** — no details, no proof, just locked my funds based on their ""internal investigation.""

This feels incredibly unfair, especially for small users like me. Honestly, it’s starting to feel like a scam at this point.

Has anyone else faced this? Any advice on what steps I should take next to get back my hard earned money. As far as i know, their ""investigation"" will straight up take forever.

Update: Prior to this, the one CS guy named “Loki” can actually provide a good answer to my restriction ticket. He said that my withdrawal addresses were “unsafe” and it got my account flagged ( p/s: the addresses are from binance and my ledger). So i removed the addresses and i still got flagged again due to this ridiculous reason. It is certainly looking like they are trying to find a reason to lock my funds.

Update 2: they keep dismissing my tickets, ignoring my messages. I’m at totally loss here, please share this story so others don’t get into the similar situation like me.

SBR (Saber) is a cryptocurrency associated with the Saber protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) for stablecoins and wrapped assets built on Solana. Here are several reasons why SBR might be considered a good project or investment (depending on context and risk tolerance):

1. Stablecoin Focus
Saber specializes in stablecoin and wrapped asset trading, which often have low volatility and high volume, making it a core DeFi infrastructure.

2. High Speed and Low Fees (Solana-based)
Built on Solana, Saber benefits from fast transaction speeds and very low fees, which is ideal for DeFi protocols.

3. Liquidity Pool Rewards
Users can earn yield by providing liquidity, and SBR is used to incentivize liquidity providers with staking and farming opportunities.

4. Composable DeFi Infrastructure
Saber is designed to be integrated with other Solana-based DeFi protocols, making it a foundational layer for building more complex financial products.

5. Backed by Major Ecosystem Support
Saber was one of the most prominent DeFi protocols on Solana during its initial growth phase and received significant attention and capital inflow.

You're chasing pumps, not fundamentals. By the time you see that 25% daily gain on TikTok, the smart money has already positioned itself weeks ago. You're buying at the top from the very people who will be dumping on you.

You have zero strategy. Most ""investors"" are just gambling - buying random tokens with catchy names, hoping they'll moon. No entry strategy, no exit plan, no risk management. Just vibes and prayer.

You lack patience. Crypto wealth isn't built overnight (despite what influencers claim). The people who actually made life-changing money held through brutal bear markets for years, not weeks.

You're emotional. Fear and greed dictate your every move. Panic selling during crashes, FOMO buying during rallies. The market manipulators literally design their movements to trigger these emotions in retail traders like us.

You're listening to the wrong people. That influencer with the rented Lambo isn't making money from crypto - they're making it from selling you courses, paid groups, and affiliate links to exchanges with high leverage.

You're ignoring the tax implications. Many ""profitable"" traders actually lose money after accounting for taxes, especially with frequent trading generating short-term capital gains.

The brutal truth? The crypto game is rigged against retail. The whales, institutions, project insiders, and exchanges see your positions and can move the market against you. They have information and capital advantages you can't overcome.

Not because I want a Lambo at 17, but because I want a safety net. I dream of traveling, backpacking, and living stress-free after my apprenticeship with some cash saved. I wouldn’t even use that money; I’d work as a skydiving instructor. I just want it to feel free and at peace. So, I studied markets, politics, tariffs—everything. I barely slept, neglected school, and dove deep into understanding it all. I started with $3,900, my entire savings, and traded it up to $5,000 USDT with careful risk management and small trades over a couple of months, knowing we weren’t near the bottom of this correction before a new uptrend starts. I wanted to build capital for the final dip to make a bigger investment when the moment came.



April 7th finally was the moment. I stayed up all night, ready to buy into my 10 altcoins I’ve researched for months:  



* NEAR Protocol  
* Fetch AI
* ImmutableX  
* Sei
* AR  
* Aethir  
* CKB  
* POLYX  
* Manta  
* Xai  
* TokenFi



I bought in with 5x leverage, splitting my capital—half when Bitcoin hit $75,930, the rest at $74,620. I recorded everything as a memory for the future and swore to myself to hold these positions, set a stop loss at break-even, and ride the wave without getting greedy or doing dumb stuff. I swore it, knowing I had a tendency to get caught up in feelings like greed and make bad choices in my life.



The market exploded upward as Trump introduced the 90-day tariff pause a few hours later. Bitcoin hit $84,000, and I was up about $6,000. Stop losses were set, and I felt safe. I knew $75,000 was the bottom. Over the next couple of weeks, my mind started racing, doing dumb calculations I swore I’d never do and staring at PnL numbers. I thought: if I held, and each coin averaged a 10x, which is pretty pessimistic in an altseason, I’d have $250,000. At 17. I was so confident—macro trends, my analysis, everything screamed JUST HOLD and don’t mess it up now and get greedy.



But then, Bitcoin started consolidating, and it drove me kind of insane. Not because I was scared I’d get stopped out, but because I started to lose touch with reality. That $250,000 I had in my mind felt like peanuts, like nothing. I got used to the idea of 250k. Greed crept in. I wanted more.



I saw a ton of liquidity around $80,000 and thought, “What if I sell now, lock in $8,000 profit, wait for a dip to 80k, then re-enter with my new capital one last time before i let it run?” That’d turn the hypothetical 250k into 600k or thereabouts. Everything inside me screamed, don’t do it; you swore to stick to your plan, and there’s no guarantee the market dips to 80k. I knew the only thing I had to do was: Nothing. Simple. 



Later that week, I pressed the sell button. 8k profit.



Then I completely lost it. Bitcoin continued to consolidate, and my mind started playing games even harder. 650k felt like nothing. Peanuts again. I started craving more AGAIN.  
  
So I started thinking, “If Bitcoin doesn’t dip to $80,000, I’m screwed anyway, so why not take a short position?” At that point, I hadn’t slept for weeks, my personal life was a mess, and I wasn’t thinking straight; I was a complete mess. I entered the short position when Bitcoin started pumping and taking out the last liquidity above us with all of my capital, and it went great. It hit my entry, started falling immediately, and I was in profits again. But with the mindset of “if it doesn’t get to 80k, I’m screwed anyway,” I forgot to place a stop loss. 



The next day, I woke up to a massive pump, with Bitcoin at 90k or something like that. My short was bleeding.



Weeks of hell followed. Literal hell. I couldn’t eat, lost 6kg, couldn’t sleep, and panicked over the fear of another wick to the upside liquidating me. A disaster. I was angry, stressed, waiting for a dip that never came. GDP data came in, markets dumped, but not enough. Bitcoin climbed to $97,300, my liquidation looming at $98,200. Fast forward, everything’s gone. Two and a half weeks of horror, feeling like I aged five years, having panic attacks 24/7.  
  
I watched my video which i've recorded on Black Monday a dozen times, swearing to stick to my plan and not do anything dumb.  
  
Self-fulfilling prophecy, I guess, haha!



The money’s gone ($14k), but that’s not what kills me. I’m not crying over the initial investment of $3,900—money comes and goes.



What hurts is I betrayed my plan; I betrayed myself. I prepared months for the bottom, hit it perfectly, got the best entries imaginable, and was on track for at least $100,000, maybe $250,000, or even more, considering an altseason.  
  
Right now, I’d already be sitting on around 40k already, and nothing has even really started yet, just a few small rallies.



Next time i'll know for sure that if everything in you screams not to do something, don’t fucking do it. Sounds easy, but isn't once your in the situation.  
  
I gambled everything I worked so hard for away. Because it was nothing more than that; A gamble:  
  
Closing my positions and entering that short had no real analysis backing it, just pure PnL numbers and greed. No analysis, no stop loss, all in. Basically every death sentence in trading at once. Completely out of my mind, knowing I should just hold and it probably wouldn’t work out. Knowing I could hold and likely come out with 250k in profits. Knowing I had the best possible positions I could imagine. Knowing I was already max exposed. Knowing I’d break my plan. Knowing it went against everything I’d always told myself not to do in trading. Knowing it broke every rule I set for myself. Knowing it was pure gambling. Knowing I had no real analysis to justify it. Knowing the only reason I was doing it was greed.



I even told my mom in the kitchen I was about to make the dumbest decision of my life, begging her to keep me away from my phone or laptop so I wouldn’t do it, haha. I knew it was incredibly dumb, a pure gamble with zero analysis. The only reason I did it was greed. Nothing else.





I’m embarrassed, but I’m sharing this because maybe it’ll help someone else. Greed’s a bitch. STICK TO YOUR PLAN.



Everything else in my life is falling apart, and for the last year, it’s been a downward spiral. But that’s how it always goes for me. I start something new, get really good at it fast, and burn my hands.



Have a great day, best regards,

Historically, we’ve seen blowoff tops marked by retail mania, Coinbase crashing, altseason insanity, and indicators like the Pi Cycle Top and CBBI peaking near 100. This time? None of that. Pi Cycle hasn’t flashed. CBBI is still well below euphoric territory. BTC dominance hasn’t dropped , in fact, it has stayed elevated or even increased, which is unusual for a fullblown bull cycle. Typically, we see BTC dominance crash as capital flows into altcoins during the mania phase. That hasn’t happened yet.

And yet... macro is turning ugly. No sign of Fed rate cuts. Recession risks are rising in the US. Liquidity is tightening. It feels like either  

(a) the best is yet to come, and this was just a midcycle pause before the real mania  
(b) this was a stealth top and the cycle ends prematurely due to macro headwinds  
(c) the bull cycle timeline has shifted entirely,  maybe delayed by a year, which would be highly unusual compared to previous halvingdriven patterns

Another strange thing is that global M2 money supply has already peaked. stocks are also down. Where is all the money going?

1kftun1,"ETH is stuck because of L2 leverage, fake volume, and no real demand",nullpointer2x,1,1,2025-05-06 02:29:04,"ETH price isn’t moving, and a big part of it goes back to how the Ethereum Foundation helped create the L2 ecosystem. A lot of ETH was lent or allocated off-exchange to bootstrap rollups like Matic, Optimism, Arbitrum, StarkNet, etc. The goal was vertical scaling and more transaction throughput without stressing mainnet.

But here’s the issue: most of these L2s didn’t take off. Real usage is weak. Most activity is short-term (airdrops, farming), and their tokens are easy to manipulate, low market cap, thin liquidity. That made it tempting to artificially pump them and inflate transaction volume, which gets mirrored back onto Ethereum mainnet as if it’s legit demand. It’s not.

Meanwhile, ETH is locked in staking or buried in contracts, so there's no real spot pressure. No liquidation risk, no reflexive price movement. Smart money saw the setup and shorted. Retail never came back. NFTs are dead, DeFi’s stale, and ETH just flatlined.

The worst part? While this was happening, the ETH Foundation sold near local tops. Retail took the exit bags.

And while Ethereum focused on fragmented L2s, **Solana quietly scaled vertically, on a single chain, and took the market**. It’s now eating ETH’s lunch in active users, stablecoin velocity, and developer mindshare. Even **Sui**, of all things, is starting to eat into ETH’s dominance. The market’s moving on.

ETH might bounce a bit during altseason, but the structural issues aren’t going away.

Then I contacted customer support and initially they tried to give me random reasons and tried to pin it on me (on my trade, leverage etc), throwing different terms at them. I consistently told them that I know how leverage works and my trade was far from liquidation and I had good enough margin. I also sent screenshots of trade.

1kg6iid,Is XRP a meme coin? - The Ultimate Showdown,CunningStunt_1,34,56,2025-05-06 14:54:52,"*There appears to be some sort of botnet that mass downvotes those critical of  XRP, so please upvote helpful responses. Downvote those spreading unverifiable fan fiction.*

I am going to explain why I think XRP is a memecoin. XRP fans, please respond **with evidence** why i am wrong. 

1. XRP's value is not derived from its purpose as the gas token on XRPL. Using data from [here](https://xrpscan.com/metrics) roughly 3k XRP is spent as fees daily. So roughly 6k USD is spent daily. 
Which does not justify its billions in marketcap. Its 'ODL' (another meme within a meme) was [declared by ripple as demand neutral](https://imgur.com/a/W4ynYQV). Quickly bought and sold so does not cause price fluctuations. 

2. Institutional users of the XRP token. We have all heard this before. But we can not see it. Please prove these users exists via usage on-chain. I will accept a degree of assumption here. [Here is blackrocks wallet on eth](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/blackrock)

3. Ripples stable coin; RLUSD. Launched to a lot of fanfare, mainly onto the Ethereum chain. [Evidence of RLUSD circulation by chain](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/ripple-usd). How can XRP be the payment rails of the world, if they are doing the majority of the settlement on eth? 

4. Using retail funds to buy already successful businesses to enrich their shareholders. Nearly 100% of Ripples income comes from XRP token sales. [Evidence](https://imgur.com/a/BSGvpZR). They then use this money to buy businesses such as Hidden Road, with no method of value accrual to the XRP token. The profits of those businesses go to excu team/shareholders, while XRP retail buys pick up the tab.

1kkrwl1,"I read this from another user, is it true? What do you think?",setross7310,24,41,2025-05-12 13:00:02,"The cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to be supported not by real demand, but by a fragile scheme of leverage pushed to the max. According to a growing theory, key players like Tether and Justin Sun are orchestrating a strategy to artificially inflate prices and prevent the system from collapsing under its own weight.

The mechanism is as follows: Tether prints billions of USDT, apparently without real backing, and quickly sends them to exchanges controlled by Justin Sun like HTX (formerly Huobi). From there, the funds are funneled to DeFi protocols like AAVE, where they are used to borrow more. The assets obtained are then reinvested in BTC or ETH, driving up the price. This process allows the purchased assets to be used as new collateral to borrow more and repeat the cycle, creating the illusion of infinite growth — a sort of monetary “glitch.”

This hyper-leveraged scheme only works as long as prices remain high. Too rapid a decline would trigger a cascade of forced liquidations, which the market is unable to absorb. To avoid collapse, Tether intervenes again by printing more “rescue” USDT, pumping liquidity into the system at the right time to reverse the declines and protect long positions, especially those of small investors who could not withstand the pressure.

Since April, every time the price has approached areas of high liquidation risk, there have been sudden upward reversals, coinciding with new Tether emissions and transfers to DeFi protocols. The suspicion is that this mechanism is not random, but part of a deliberate strategy to keep alive a system that, otherwise, could collapse in a few days.

In short, what many see as a free market is actually a house of cards supported by extreme levers, artificial liquidity and coordinated operations between central players. If even just one of these pillars were to give way, the consequences would be devastating.

1kq4og6,Pi Network: Free Crypto or Fool’s Gold?,Nnlp122,0,6,2025-05-19 06:13:48,"Pi Network burst onto the scene in 2019 (fittingly, on Pi Day) as a mobile-only crypto project by three Stanford grads￼.  It promised everyday people “free” cryptocurrency for simply tapping their phones once a day.  Pi’s marketing is grand – the whitepaper talks about “building a cryptocurrency and smart contracts platform secured and operated by everyday people” and an “inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem” powered by Pi￼.  And Pi did attract a crowd: the app’s Google Play listing shows ~5 million installs【42†】, yet Pi routinely boasted 60–70 million total “Pioneers” (users) on its network. This gap immediately raises eyebrows – more on that in a bit.

Business Model & Tokenomics

Pi’s economy has some unusual features.  First, no ICO or token sale was ever held – the whitepaper even warns users that any “sale” of Pi outside the app is fake ￼.  In fact, Pi’s docs say 100 billion Pi coins is the max supply: 80% (80 B PI) is for the community and 20% (20 B PI) for the core team ￼.  Of that 80 B to the community, Pi designates 65 B for mining rewards, 10 B for ecosystem-building (via a Pi Foundation), and 5 B for liquidity ￼.  The team’s 20 B is supposed to unlock gradually as miners earn their coins.

In early phases Pi “mined” coins via a simple tap-per-day system with referral bonuses – no mining rig needed.  Officially, mining rewards halved each time the user base grew 10× (e.g. at 10M, 100M users) ￼, to mimic Bitcoin’s scarcity.  However, before Mainnet there was no fixed cap applied, so supply was effectively unlimited during growth.  In practice this led to very high inflation: by early 2025 the network had unlocked about 4.9 billion Pi, with another 1.54 B set to unlock over the next year (roughly 133 million Pi per month) ￼.  In other words, Pi was creating coins at a torrid pace.

Analysts warn this flood of tokens dilutes value.  For example, CCN reports “Pi’s circulating supply has doubled within a year,” a pace of inflation that “could drive the token price toward dilution” ￼.  Indeed, Pi’s market price has slid sharply as supply unlocked.  Cointelegraph noted Pi’s price near all-time lows (~$0.67 as of April 2025) as millions of new tokens hit the market ￼.  In short, supply-demand math suggests Pi could struggle to hold any price if coins outnumber real usage by that margin.

How does Pi “make money”?  Officially, it hasn’t taken any user fees – the team never collected cash from Pioneers ￼.  Early on, Pi introduced optional video ads in the app to monetize active miners ￼.  It also requires full KYC (passport/ID) for everyone, ostensibly to prevent fraud – but one effect is Pi now has a verified database of users.  (Critics say this data may itself be the real product.)  Recently Pi launched a $100 million fund (in PI tokens and USD) to invest in startups building on Pi’s blockchain ￼ ￼, using 10% of tokens set aside for the ecosystem.  The idea is to bootstrap apps and transactions, but it means Pi is essentially betting on future adoption rather than today’s revenue.

Key takeaways on tokenomics/business:
	•	Pi capped supply at 100 B (80/20 split) and no ICO ￼ ￼.
	•	It’s been minting coins quickly: ~4.9 B by early 2025 (≈5% of total) and still unlocking ~133 M/month ￼.
	•	Critics warn Pi’s inflation has outpaced any real demand, helping push its price way down ￼ ￼.
	•	The team holds 20% of supply (20 B PI) unlocked with miners ￼, but outside analysts worry insiders actually control a large chunk of coins (as much as 20% of all PI) ￼.
	•	Pi’s revenue plan so far relies on ads and ecosystem growth, not a proven business model ￼ ￼.

User Growth and Network Effects

A core Pi strategy is inviting friends. In practice, Pi spread by word-of-mouth and hype, especially in developing regions. According to Coin Bureau, Pi’s activity has been strongest in Asia, Africa, and Latin America ￼ – places where crypto can leapfrog via smartphones. As one article notes, Pi’s mobile-first approach aimed to include users who can’t afford mining rigs ￼ ￼.

Pi claims huge numbers: a press release in mid-2024 touted “more than 60 million users” ￼, and media reports spoke of “over 70 million users” worldwide ￼. Yet on-the-ground figures look very different.  By the time Pi opened its mainnet (Feb 2025), only about 8–9 million wallets had been migrated on-chain ￼.  In other words, only ~15% of claimed users had ever moved coins into a Pi wallet. Even by Dec 2024 Pi’s own updates showed 18 M KYC’d Pioneers but only 8 M migrated ￼.

In fact, Pi’s app stores tell the tale: the Pi Network app shows about 5 million downloads (see image above), not 70 million.  This discrepancy suggests many people signed up but never really used Pi. Analysts have pointed out exactly this: “Pi Network’s user base does not seem to align with reality”, since the network shows far fewer active wallets than its marketing claims ￼ ￼.  In effect, Pi’s growth strategy created millions of “accounts” via invites, but most sit inactive.

The referral system itself is built in: early users mine faster and earn bonuses for bringing in others. This network effect helped Pi explode in size. But it also draws criticism: many compare it to a pyramid or multi-level marketing scheme. For example, AIMultiple observes Pi “works like direct selling/affiliate marketing…promising future rewards for bringing in new users,” benefiting early adopters most ￼.  Crypto analysts like Justin Bons liken the referral plan to MLM “schemes” that add cost without benefit ￼. In short, Pi’s expansion has been viral, but it trades heavily on social hype. As one fintech writer notes, Pi taps the psychology of FOMO – the app is “free,” it evokes Bitcoin’s story, and a “massive community” lends social proof ￼. Many people stick with Pi simply because nothing was required of them except time, and they hope to hit it big later.

Importantly, Pi requires daily participation. If a user stops tapping daily, their mining rate falls to zero (no coins). This churn means many Pioneers likely fell off before Mainnet. Data from exchanges suggest only ~35 million are still “engaged” as of 2025 ￼ – roughly half of original sign-ups. In summary, Pi’s user growth is real, but built on invitation loops and viral marketing. It created a huge audience, but transforming that into genuine, paying users is an open question.

Transparency and Technology

Pi’s vision promised an open crypto, but in reality many core details have been murky. For one, Pi’s blockchain is permissioned: everyone must KYC with personal ID before trading Pi, and the Pi Core Team controls the network’s nodes.  In fact, Coin Bureau cites a January 2025 report saying all mainnet nodes are run by Pi’s own servers ￼.  In effect, Pi is not a decentralized public chain yet – it’s centrally managed behind the scenes.

The tech is essentially off-the-shelf: Pi uses a modified Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) ￼. Stellar’s SCP is energy-efficient and fast, but it relies on federated trust (your “security circle” of friends). Pi promoted these Security Circles in 2020 as a way to build trust graphs ￼, but Bons noted this is mostly cosmetics.  He also pointed out Pi lacks a smart-contract virtual machine – it can’t run DeFi apps – making it “neither scalable nor programmable” ￼ ￼.  (In other words, Pi can move tokens around but not much more, unless the team adds serious new tech.)

What about governance and code? Pi has published a whitepaper and even some code snippets (it held hackathons and put a Pi SDK on GitHub)￼, but the full ledger and internal workings remain private.  The Pi Foundation is described as an “ownerless” nonprofit for future governance￼, but its actual powers are unclear.  The whitepaper touts an 80/20 token split for fairness￼, yet Bons and others flag that we have no independent audit showing who got what.  In fact Bons warned insiders could own up to ~20% of coins despite Pi’s egalitarian claims ￼.

The upshot: Pi’s structure is far from transparent. Users are anonymous to each other, but not to Pi’s team (via KYC).  Pi even tells people to beware of scammers, since Pi has no market sale of its coin ￼ – yet it has not fully revealed its own accounts or allocations. Combined with the heavy central control (“fully permissioned,” as Bons put it ￼), this has led critics to call Pi more centralized than decentralization claims suggest.

Experts Weigh In

Cryptocurrency experts have been openly skeptical. Justin Bons (CyberCapital founder) went as far as tweeting that “PI is fully permissioned (centralized)… PI is an investment scam; it is that bad” ￼.  His detailed critique highlights most of the above points: he notes the constant delays to Mainnet, the recycled Stellar tech, no Turing-complete VM, and a referral system that “generates unnecessary network costs” like an MLM ￼ ￼.  He even called the mining “lockup” plan a Ponzi-like pump for insiders, arguing early investors could reap inflated prices at everyone else’s expense ￼.

Earlier, Ben Zhou (CEO of Bybit) labeled Pi a scam dangerous enough to be “worse than meme coins”.  Similarly, crypto bloggers have warned that Pi mining adds no real utility – users just watch ads and hope for future payouts ￼ ￼.  A balanced analysis on LinkedIn summed it up: Pi is a masterclass in marketing psychology but “hype does not guarantee legitimacy”￼.  In other words, Pi cleverly harnesses excitement and social proof ￼, but many of the red flags (central control, high inflation, referral incentives) mirror known crypto scams of the past.

So, Scam or Not?

Is Pi Network technically a scam?  It hasn’t stolen anyone’s money or disappeared overnight, so it’s not a classic fraud con.  However, based on what we see today, Pi looks extremely risky and overhyped. Its business and tokenomics rely on future success that isn’t proven, while insiders and aggressive early adopters stand to gain most.  Many indicators match a pyramid-like model: new users are encouraged to recruit more, and the asset’s value hinges on believing others will keep buying in.

From an economic and mathematical standpoint, Pi’s design is shaky: unlimited early inflation, centralized control, and no clear revenue suggest a token likely to end up near zero unless its ecosystem suddenly booms.  As one crypto expert put it, Pi may promise a revolution “by everyday people,” but so far its chain is run by one core team and its coins by one exchange of hype ￼ ￼. Philosophically, Pi’s ethos of fairness is undermined if many accounts are ghosted or insiders hold big slices ￼ ￼.

In short, treat Pi with extreme caution. If you enjoy being part of the experiment and never invested real money, fine – just don’t expect any guaranteed payoff. But don’t count on Pi making you rich. Many analysts essentially call it what it feels like: a massive social pyramid that mostly hands out nothing more than tokens with questionable value. As one write-up warns, Pi’s story shows that massive interest and community do not automatically mean a project has value ￼. Until (or if) Pi delivers real, usable crypto and transparent governance, it remains a high-risk gamble at best – a cautionary tale more than a sure win.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1kq4og6/pi_network_free_crypto_or_fools_gold/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

1ks74ln,"How I Navigate BTC Volatility: Watching Rotation, Sessions & 4H Trends to Trade Alts and Meme Coins",boringpretty,3,3,2025-05-21 19:44:25,"On volatile days like today when bitcoin hits a new all time high, I’ve found that most traders either overtrade or get caught trying to long alts too early while Bitcoin’s still moving. I trade altcoin and meme coin futures, and over time I’ve picked up on a few key patterns that help avoid getting clipped.

Here’s how I approach it:

**1. I Wait for Rotation — Not FOMO into Alts During BTC Moves**
When Bitcoin’s trending hard (up or down), it drains liquidity. Alts usually don’t move cleanly during that time, and meme coins especially get wrecked by slippage or wicks.
Once BTC starts consolidating—particularly on the 4H—that’s when capital rotates, and that’s when I start looking for trades.

**2. Bitcoin Dominance & DXY Help Frame Macro Risk**

* BTC dominance rising = stay cautious on alts.
* Once dominance starts to drop while BTC is stable, that’s usually when alts wake up.
* If DXY is falling and ETHBTC is gaining, that’s a green light for me to start scanning alts.

**3. Timing Matters — I Trade Around Sessions**
Market behavior shifts a lot depending on the time of day. Here’s how I break it down:

* **Asia (00:00–02:00 UTC):** Early meme pumps, lots of front-running
* **London (07:00–09:00 UTC):** Momentum setups, range expansions
* **NY (12:00–14:00 UTC):** High volatility + traps
  If I’m trading, it’s usually around these windows with the 4H in mind.

**4. 4H Is My Anchor Timeframe**
Most of my context comes from 4H candles. If BTC or an alt is setting clean levels or consolidating tightly on the 4H, I’ll then zoom into LTFs for entries—but I don’t touch it unless the higher timeframe looks tradable.

**5. I Always Preview Order Book & Spreads Before Entering**
Especially with meme coins or low-volume alts—spread can be 5–10%, or there might be gaps in the book. That’s instant slippage and a bad fill. I check DOM (TradingView), depth charts, or use Dextools for newer tokens.

**Summary:**
I wait for BTC to chill, track macro signals (dominance, DXY), time trades around sessions, and only trade alts/memes showing strength and clean structure on the 4H.
This has helped me survive and grow during fast-moving conditions without relying on hype.

Would love to hear how others are navigating current market structure—especially with BTC just tagging new highs.

This helps the model to realise if a Breakout is comming and what's the direction

[2] Then, it Simulates possible price paths using a Jump-Diffusion Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) with:

Dynamic drift

Stochastic volatility

Poisson-like jump processes

Milstein numerical scheme for precise path integration

As the title says, I'm looking for some thoughts on this portfolio. I already own a bit of BTC and I’m looking to invest a bit more in the following coins: ETH, LINK, RNDR, INJ, and FET.

From my research, these seem to be strong projects, each with real world use cases and partnerships with reputable companies.

My idea is to divide my initial investment among these coins, probably something like:

* 20% in ETH
* 18% in LINK
* 44% split between FET and RNDR
* 18% in INJ

I'm not aiming for a 10x return ,I know that’s unlikely to happen. I’m just looking for some profits and a welcome for me to the altcoins world.

I don't have any issues either with holding the coins for some time , I'm not a person that watch's or checks the market every day. 

What do you think? Do these seem like solid projects to start with, or too risky?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

They typically enter these positions early, and once the price hits their profit targets, they exit immediately. This appears more like short-to-medium-term swing trading rather than long-term investing, as I rarely see them holding these coins for months or years.

I'm really curious about how exactly these traders initially identify and select these promising small-cap altcoins. Since there are thousands of alternative coins out there, what specific methods do they use to screen and filter these potential gems early? Do they primarily rely on fundamental analysis, specialized crypto tools, social media sentiment tracking, or insights from insider communities?

I already understand the basics of technical analysis and swing trading, but my main interest here is how they pinpoint these coins early in the first place.

Moreover, no nation-state will ever allow Bitcoin to replace its fiat currency. Doing so would mean surrendering control over its citizens.

1kxdtwv,"How I Built a Step-by-Step Plan to Turn $1,000 into $25K–$100K (And What Most Traders Get Wrong)",Marcel_elma,0,12,2025-05-28 10:39:56,"Over the last few months, I’ve seen many retail traders sidelined — either due to poor timing, overtrading, or simply holding the wrong assets during the wrong phase of the market. Many are down to $1,000 or less in capital, feeling like they’ve already lost the chance to benefit from the market momentum.

But the truth is, if you still have $1,000, you’re not out — not yet. I’m going to share a simplified framework that I’ve personally found useful. It’s designed for those starting with small capital, and it avoids hype, overconfidence, or unrealistic expectations. This is not financial advice, but it is a strategic perspective.


Step 1: Big Coins Move Slow. You Need Microcaps.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are great, but doubling your $1,000 in BTC might take months or years. That doesn’t work if you’re trying to build quickly in a fast-moving bull market. The focus should shift to microcaps — tokens with market caps under $1 million — that still have actual teams, products, and traction.

These aren’t listed on Coinbase or Binance. You’ll need tools like MetaMask (a free crypto wallet) and networks like Fantom or Polygon, where transaction fees are low and small-cap gems still exist. You can use aggregators like CoinGecko or DexScreener to explore these projects.


Step 2: Find Two Solid Projects

Split your capital — $450 into one project, $450 into another. Get involved in their communities (Telegram, Discord), ask about the team, the roadmap, the product. You want to avoid rugs, so verify there’s some real development and activity.

Criteria:
	•	Project has a working product or MVP
	•	Team is still active during the bear market
	•	Telegram isn’t a ghost town
	•	Liquidity and market cap are verifiable


Step 3: Take Profits Early

If your microcap investments go 3x, sell 50% immediately. Now you’ve turned $900 into $2,700 and derisked. This strategy is about compounding gains, not holding forever.


Step 4: Repeat With Larger Plays

Reinvest that $1,350 into two more well-vetted projects. You’re now holding four positions. In a realistic scenario:
	•	One does 10x
	•	One does 3x
	•	One breaks even
	•	One fails

That gives you around $6,000 portfolio value.


Step 5: Upgrade Trade Sizes

With larger capital, you move to higher market cap coins. Use $2,000 positions and look for momentum — projects being actively discussed, traded, and trending. These aren’t unknown anymore, but they still offer 2–3x opportunities.

Exit quickly and consistently. If you make $10K from $1K, don’t let it all ride. Cash out $1,000. Make it real.


Step 6: Systemize Wins, Don’t Chase Home Runs

From this point, the goal isn’t to 10x again. The goal is to make $5K repeatedly. Stack small wins. Protect profits. Keep repeating the strategy: identify trends early, rotate profits, and gradually reduce exposure to high-risk assets.


Step 7: Cash Out and Scale Down Risk

Once you realize $20K in profit, move most of it off-exchange. Don’t re-risk it. Trade with a smaller stack ($5K–$10K) if you want, but understand: the goal was reached.

If your remaining capital goes to zero, you’ve still succeeded.


Final Thought

This isn’t a story of “get rich quick.” It’s about using strategy, risk management, and discipline to build something from almost nothing. The key is understanding how to operate at every stage of the journey — not just how to win trades, but how to survive, scale, and eventually walk away.

If it doesn’t work? It’s not a failure. Sometimes the best move is to take a break, focus on your career or business, and wait for better conditions. Crypto will still be here.

1kxp2bw,Everyone’s Watching Price. No One’s Watching Bitcoin’s Quantum Vulnerability.,RadiantWarden,0,21,2025-05-28 18:47:33,"Bitcoin is sold as digital gold, a hedge against inflation, a symbol of freedom from central banks. But there’s one thing it’s not, and nobody in the media wants to admit it: Bitcoin is not built to survive the future.

We’re heading into a quantum age. Fast. And when real quantum computers arrive, they won’t just outperform classical systems—they’ll break them. Bitcoin included. Here’s why: every Bitcoin transaction relies on something called ECDSA, a cryptographic system that keeps your private keys secure. But once you send Bitcoin, your public key is exposed. In today’s world, that’s fine. But in a quantum world? That’s game over. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s can take your public key and calculate your private key. Just like that, the vault door swings open and anyone can take what’s inside.

It’s not theoretical. If you’ve ever sent Bitcoin, your wallet will be vulnerable when quantum computing hits scale. And because Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, the targets are already marked. All it will take is one breakthrough. Now here’s the real problem: Bitcoin can’t pivot. Changing its cryptographic system would require a hard fork, a messy, risky, slow process involving every miner, node, wallet, and exchange in the world. And if history has shown us anything, it’s that Bitcoin doesn’t like to change.

Meanwhile, agencies like the NSA, China’s tech ministry, and the U.S. NIST are openly working on post-quantum standards. The people building the future are getting ready. But Bitcoin? It’s stuck. Imagine waking up and $300 billion in Bitcoin has vanished. Not because of a market crash, but because it was simply taken. Instantly. No hacks. No brute force. Just quantum math.

Some projects are preparing for this future. XRP uses a different signature system (Ed25519) that’s harder for quantum computers to break and easier to upgrade if needed. Flare is modular and designed to evolve. Hedera (HBAR) is governed by a council of real companies who can act quickly and deploy updates without the chaos of community politics. Ethereum is still using the same ECDSA as Bitcoin, and with even more complexity under the hood.

But here’s where it gets bigger. We’re not just talking about faster computing. We’re talking about a total shift in what’s possible. Quantum communication, using entangled particles for instant, secure data transfer, is already being tested. Anti-gravity propulsion, long buried under black-budget secrecy, is starting to come into the public eye. Navy patents, declassified UAP footage, and whispered disclosures are surfacing. In that world, coins that take ten minutes to settle feel like horse-drawn carriages in the age of warp drives.

The next wave of infrastructure won’t just be faster. It’ll be physics-bending, frictionless, real-time, and planetary—maybe even interplanetary. We’ll need digital assets that can sync with light-speed systems. XRP, Flare, and Hedera are at least headed in that direction. Bitcoin isn’t. So while institutions, media, and ETFs keep hyping BTC as the final destination, the truth is that it’s a monument. A symbol. A closed system that can’t keep up.

When the world flips into quantum gear, the assets that were built to move, adapt, and integrate will keep running. Bitcoin will just sit there, valuable only to those who haven’t realized the vault has already been cracked. In the end, it wasn’t digital gold. It was glass.

⸻

TLDR:

Bitcoin isn’t ready for the quantum era. Once quantum computers mature, they’ll be able to reverse-engineer wallets from public transactions. There’s no fix in sight, just delay and denial. Meanwhile, assets like XRP, Flare, and Hedera are better positioned to survive in a world where quantum tech and anti-gravity systems change everything. BTC isn’t the future. It’s a fossil.

Many people still think we're repeating the 2017 cycle, like it's guaranteed. But what if this cycle is different? What if altcoins stay lagging behind and don’t rise with Bitcoin?

I hold some alts, and I still think altseason will come once the FED turns dovish. But what if the FED doesn’t ease? Then maybe Bitcoin just keeps going up, following global M2 like it usually does.

Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin is freedom.
Bitcoin is digital gold. And one day, it’s going to a million dollars.

But here’s the one thing barely anyone’s talking about

The available supply is disappearing not because it’s being mined faster but because the giants are swallowing it whole.

Every day, massive institutions like BlackRock, governments and banks are silently stacking.
Meanwhile, most of us are still waiting for the “perfect entry"" chasing memes or thinking we’ll buy later. But by the time you realize what’s happening, the boat will be full.
Bitcoin is gonna go up in price, yeah.
But if most of the supply is held by the same powers that already run the system 
its original purpose won’t be fulfilled.

It was never meant to be just another asset on Wall Street.
It was created to give people a shot at owning something that can’t be seized, frozen, inflated or censored. These giants are buying more.
They’re pushing the price higher.
And locking more of it out of reach.

Bitcoin was meant to be a revolution for the people but it risks becoming another financial weapon owned by the elite if we don’t act. 

Bitcoin isn’t gonna save everyone. It never could.
Even Satoshi (whether a person or a group) knew that.
It’s impossible for 8 billion people to hold 21 million coins. Not everyone’s going to make it. But we should try.
Because we still have time to wake people up.
We still have a window, however small, to help the ones around us stack before the last scraps of supply are gone.
Before it’s out of reach.

So if you’ve already figured this out, Don’t panic sell. Don’t try to flip it for a quick dollar. Don’t trade it away chasing dopamine.

Buy it. Hold it. Educate others.
And when the time comes, pass it on.
To your kids. Your people. Your bloodline.

Because when the institutions finish buying,
When retail finally realizes it’s too late,
When Bitcoin becomes just another financial product, You’ll be one of the few who actually owns a piece of it.

* In the last 10 days of each month, Bitcoin usually crashes (I'm not sure why, but it happen).
* Altcoins also drop during this period .As showing in the attached picture , It's mostly having the dip last 10 days. you can validate that.
* I stack altcoins at their lowest levels during the Bitcoin crashes.
* I use the Williams %R indicator (it shows the lowest dip, you can check both RSI and William %R and you will see it), RSI doesn't show the dip
* I buy and sell a coin that is not controlled by entities, no team funds, no VCs, no big miners , no big staking .. etc ( you can do research )
* I sell very small amounts each time.
* So far, it's working well I'm enjoying free PnL every time and never touching my salary and stacking more .

Funding rates are basically the fees longs pay shorts (or shorts pay longs) every few hours. When funding’s positive, bulls are paying up, that usually means the market’s leaning bullish, but also that longs might be over-leveraged and ripe for a shakeout. Negative funding? Bears are paying to short, which can mean a dip is overdone and a bounce is coming.

Here’s how I use it in my trading:

If funding spikes positive near a resistance zone, I get ready to short the pump.

If funding dips negative near a support level, I look for a long entry to catch the bounce.

But you gotta see the actual numbers in real-time. That’s where tools like:

Coinglass (great for funding heatmaps and live rate tracking)
Binance Futures dashboard (shows funding rate and countdown timers)
Bybit Analytics (clean interface with live funding updates)

Watch these before you enter your trades, it helps you avoid getting stuck on the wrong side of the market.

Funding rates aren’t just some fancy stat-they’re one of the best ways to read market sentiment *before* the crowd flips.

Anyone else use funding rates to time entries?

While most tokens stay trapped in the blockchain, $HEGE has already made its mark across the real world. It’s taken over Times Square, flown banners above Los Angeles, painted murals in Indonesia, London, Australia, and South Africa, and many more! 
Now, as a registered company and $200,000 in a community-controlled marketing fund, Hege is entering its next phase: real-world partnerships, sponsorships, and serious brand expansion.

This isn’t a memecoin clinging to hype, it’s a project with roots, reach, Roadmap, and the best community that my eyes have ever seen.

NFT Utility with Dividends, 
The 2,222 Hegend NFTs sold out in under 48 hours — and they’re far more than collectibles. These NFTs pay out monthly dividends based on their rarity tier:

Common – base-level dividends

Uncommon – increased returns

Rare – higher dividend tier

Epic – premium monthly payouts

Legendary – top-tier rewards for the elite Hegends

Every NFT is a stake in the story — and the rarer the token, the greater the reward. On top of that, Rogue Hegends offer trading multipliers, giving serious edge to engaged community members.
And if you’re contributing on  Reddit or Telegram, there are bonuses waiting for you too. 

Holding $HEGE means you're not a speculator, you're a stakeholder in something bigger.

Hege is already live on BitMart, MEXC, LBank, Toobit, AscendEX, IndoEx, and now Bifinance — with each listing historically followed by massive surges in volume and price. These aren’t random, they're coordinated with marketing pushes, creating the perfect storm for community growth and investor FOMO.
Hege has proven it knows how to time the market — and when the push comes, the volume follows.

All Eyes on Vegas – Bitcoin 2025
Next stop: Las Vegas. At Bitcoin 2025, one of the world’s biggest crypto conferences, Hege is planning a full-scale invasion:

Street teams wearing billboard backpacks

Daily leafleting campaigns from 11am–4pm

Digital billboard trucks blasting $HEGE ads every 90 seconds along the Vegas Strip
All funded by the $200,000 war chest raised by the community — and aimed directly at tens of thousands of crypto insiders.


Hege has a reputation for surprise. From Times Square takeovers to airborne pigs over LA, this project doesn’t follow trends — it sets them. No one knows what’s coming next — and that’s exactly why people are watching.
This isn’t just another token.

It’s a brand.
It’s a movement.
It’s a comeback story in the making.
Buy the dip. Join the community. Become a Hegend.

1l5jpcw,"Surely the only play is alts, catch the pump, sell before dump.",gowithflow192,50,67,2025-06-07 12:30:27,"Hear me out. I think HODL is just for Bitcoin. Wait several years, keep DCAing, don't even check the price. Store of wealth and all that.

For those of us wanting to trade, I think alts are just oscillators. They have a base trend and very rarely (once per cycle, maybe even once per year) have a huge pump like this:

\- massive pump

\- decays away slowly

\- sometimes secondary pumps

\- but eventually reversion to the base trend.

Sometimes the base trend is slightly up (never good enough to HODL though), sometimes it's flat, sometimes it's down! But great long term appreciation, these aren't stocks!

Here are some opportunities:

**XRP**

Big pump every 3/4 years. It's slow rising long term but I would never hodl it instead of bitcoin. Today it's way too high, I don't believe it's established a new baseline, I don't care how close they are to the US government. It's heading back sub 1 again, just a matter of time. A terrible buy today. If you hold it today, just sell it. Literally no point owning it right now.

**ETH**

I think this is a long term slow grower, again with huge pumps every few years. Honestly, I think it's still a good buy. In fact, the recent pump signalled that there is still pump potential in ETH. Some alts pump twice and never pump again, I think ETH demonstrated it will still pump from time to time. It's such a high market cap that it's pumps aren't as violent as other coins but the pumps and the decaying dumps do take quite a while so timing is not difficult.

**SOL**

Looks way over-priced. Remember, these are not stocks. There are no discounted cash flows behind the scenes building up asset price like stocks. Alts can grow baseline over years but not hugely. I think SOL will eventually go back to sub-50. Terrible buy right now, you have no idea if it will pump big and beat ATH anytime in the next year or two, or dump to 50 first. Sell it now if you own it.

**DOGE**

I think this is a good buy again if you are willing to be patient and wait for the pump. When it pumps, it will double or even triple in price. How low could it go before then? It's 0.18 today, I can't see it going sub 0.10 and when it pumps it could go pretty high.

**LINK**

Almost at lows again, not a bad price, reminds me of DOGE.

**BCH**

Pumps are getting less each time but I still think it will pump higher if you bought today

**LTC**

This is overdue a huge pump I think. Even if it's dead and nothing happens, I don't think hard to exit break-even.

**DOT**

This is a bargain, I just wish it was easier to buy from DEX/swap services. Even if it only pumps to 10 again, that's more than 2x.

  
To reiterate, I think the only trading game is to try and buy at value prices, don't overpay. Wait for the pump, obviously try to time the top but even if you sell early you can make 2x easily and possibly more. Way better than BTC. I have BTC but I'm starting to think it's a waste of time, the risks don't justify the rewards. Whereas alts bought at low prices are very low risk.

1l8vw6k,ZRXT – Utility Token Backed by Real Hardware (Disclosure: I'm part of the dev team),Galkorm,1,0,2025-06-11 15:39:01,"I’m one of the developers involved in ZRXT — an ERC-20 token created by Zortrax, a 3D printing manufacturer with over a decade of market presence. Posting here to share a transparent overview of the project as it currently stands, along with what’s coming next. This isn’t promotional — consider it firsthand due diligence.

What is ZRXT?
ZRXT is designed as a utility token tied to real-world products and services. It integrates into the Zortrax ecosystem to enable:

– Token-based discounts (up to 40%)
– Tiered staking benefits and lock-up rewards
– Community voting on software and product priorities
– Access to beta programs and AI-assisted design tools
– Future marketplace participation for 3D assets and models

Important note:
Most of these mechanics will be activated after the ICO ends. The token is live now, but full integration is staged — staking, referral rewards, on-chain voting, and marketplace access are all part of the 2025–2026 roadmap. We made that choice intentionally: first secure funding, then scale the ecosystem.

Tokenomics:
– Total supply: 380,000,000
– Public allocation: 70%
– 10% team (vested), 10% marketing/community, 10% reserve
– No minting, fixed cap, no admin backdoors
– Ethereum contract:
0xa5254C74AE79630987A34AEDB8CaA975cff88043

Buyback & burn:
Starting from the first quarter after launch, 10% of Zortrax's net operational profit will be used to buy back and burn ZRXT from the market. This is hardcoded into the token strategy — not just a marketing promise.

What’s available now:
– token.zortrax.com: sale platform
– Smart contract deployed, tokens sent immediately to wallets
– Whitepaper and roadmap on the site

Risks and trade-offs:
– Most features are post-ICO — early holders are buying before functionality is live
– No exchange listings yet — liquidity will follow the sale
– Ecosystem adoption depends on successful integration between blockchain and existing infrastructure

Why this might matter:
ZRXT is not a typical crypto-native project. It’s a token layer added to a physical product ecosystem that already exists. Printers are in production, software is actively developed, and the user base is real — the challenge now is onboarding that ecosystem into Web3 responsibly.

I’m open to questions or criticism — and I’ll answer what I can.

Israel Iran potential war is gonna shake the markets pretty damn hard. I usually stay away from politics and war talk on social media because it’s too controversial and honestly, most of us who were born into third world countries(If any here) don’t see the point in getting involved. But the truth is, conflicts like this do affect us, all of us in general a lot more than we think.

This kind of geopolitical tension doesn’t just stay between borders. It affects global financial flows. It might not start World War III tomorrow or even in a year or two. But historically, these flashpoints act as sparks. And when tensions rise, the big money I’m talking about the elites, institutions, hedge funds managing billions and trillions, they react fast(Becuz they know this kinda conflict could pull the world war III trigger anytime).

There’s only one thing these elites fear though it's war. Whether it’s a trade war, political war or its the actual on ground war, they know how dangerous it is for the markets. And they move their money accordingly.

They rush to safe haven assets like gold that’s why you’ll see gold prices spike during conflict. At the same time, risky assets like crypto start bleeding (for short term) because institutions pull liquidity to safety. Oil prices shoot up too because of supply concerns (especially in Middle East chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz). Meanwhile, stock markets tank because uncertainty kills risk tolerences of investors, theres no point in taking unnecessary risk getting exposed to global market being at risk caused by the war. Everyone needs to understand this one particular thing, market momentum doesn’t move based on your trade, my trade or even a few million dollar players. This game is moved by the ones sitting at the top table those controlling billions and trillions in liquidity. When they move, the entire system shifts. And no matter how smart or prepared you are, if you’re on the wrong side of their move, you become a victim. Even a billion dollar company can get swallowed by a bigger giant. This market isn’t fair,it’s power versus reaction.

This isn’t just theory it’s what we’re seeing in real time. CPI, inflation, Fed talks they all take a back seat when real war risk enters the equation.

And that’s exactly what we’re seeing now. Gold has spiked right back near its all-time high around $3500 today morning at around 3 am UTC+4, a level that was formed after Trump declared a 125% tariff on China back in March. With current global tension rising again, it looks like gold’s ready to break that high and form a new ATH. 

Black Swan Events like this one actually opens more door for underdogs to become rich overnight.
Wars might move markets but it destroys lives though. Real people bleed while these charts move. Kids lose parents, cities get wiped out, futures vanish overnight. No one wins when blood spills.

But don’t panic if you’re holding Bitcoin or crypto this ain’t the end. Bitcoin wasn’t built to thrive in perfect conditions as it was born out of crisis. While short term bleeding may happen due to institutional fear and liquidity shifts, Bitcoin has always come back stronger. When trust in governments and financial systems break, decentralized assets shine the brightest. Don’t panic sell understand the game. Watch how power moves, not how people react.

Bitcoin quietly pushed past $107,000. Ether and most major altcoins are inching higher. No wild spikes or plunges just a steady lift that caught me off guard.
I spent the weekend moving funds off exchanges and into cold storage. Yesterday I bought a small extra stack of sats between $105K and $106K. No frantic bidding just a few calm orders I placed and forgot about until they filled.
With the US stablecoin bill due to pass on Tuesday, I see more institutional cash waiting to hit on‑chain rails. It isn’t a moonshot play, it’s a timing play.
I’ve trimmed some high‑beta alts for more BTC and ETH. If the geopolitical news worsens, I want to stay in the assets I trust most. If things ease up, I’ll redeploy into my longer‑term DeFi farm positions.

I've been holding some altcoins since 2021, and a few others I bought late last year. Right now, I'm down about 50% overall. I've been waiting for a proper altcoin season this whole time, but it just doesn't seem to be happening.

In previous cycles, altseason was already well underway by this point. Bitcoin is over $100K, but most alts still look terrible in comparison.

**Here’s my concern:**  
I expect there *might* be a short altseason toward the end of the year. But until then, my alts could drop even further – maybe down 70% or more.

**So my question is:**  
What would you do if your main goal was simply to reduce losses, not make profits?  
Would it make sense to cut my losses now and re-enter later for a potential 1-month altseason (if it even happens)?

* BTC spiked to ≈ $107 K, then reversed as missile headlines out of the Israel-Iran theater hit the tape (FXEmpire 10:35 PM).
* Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin squeeked out gains while on-chain data show \~1 million coins just aged into the ≥ 1-year HODL bucket, a classic sign of deeper conviction.

**3) JPMorgan’s Stable-Coin Push**

* Wall Street’s biggest bank rolled out a pilot for JPMD, a deposit-backed dollar token, on Coinbase’s “Base” L2 (iNewsroom / Financial Juice 4:07 PM; Seeking Alpha 3:53 PM).

1lfdvlc,Exchange Impersonating Pyth Taken Down – https://web.pyth-usvpu.top,D-R-AZ,1,1,2025-06-19 15:36:42,"https://web.pyth-usvpu.top

This site was not just a phishing site, but a fully operational fraudulent exchange: it featured what appeared to be live trading interfaces, market-synchronized data, wallet connections, and credible deposit functionality. Funds could be transferred in from legitimate platforms such as Coinbase, and balances were reflected accurately—at least at first.

The deception became evident only when attempting to withdraw. At that point, the platform presented users with an unexpected “tax” demand: approximately 15% of profits, supposedly to satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements. This payment was framed as unlocking the withdrawal process; however, it appears more accurately described as an apparent ransom—a final-stage extraction under the pretense of compliance.

This scam bears resemblance to what was portrayed in the film The Sting: not just a fake email or login screen, but an elaborate infrastructure intended to simulate a fully legitimate exchange. Every element—from trading graphs to live chats—was built to reinforce user trust and conceal the fraud until the moment of financial capture.

The site used the name and design language of the Pyth Network, a well-known decentralized finance data oracle. This impersonation poses risks beyond personal loss; it could cause reputational harm to the broader DeFi ecosystem, to the Pyth brand, and even to Singapore’s financial credibility, as the scammers represented themselves as tied to an investment firm based in Singapore. Victims may mistakenly associate the fraud with Singaporean banking practices, especially if they were told—as one was—that a relative in Singapore had a team of 35 professionals using the platform.

The FBI-documented scam involved:

A WhatsApp-based grooming process,

A scammer using the surname “Li,”

A mobile exchange front that collapsed after a ransom-like tax demand.

The investigation, led by FBI Special Agent Bret Curtis (San Diego Field Office), is publicly available here:

The exchange, hosted at web.pyth-usvpu.top, has now been taken offline following abuse reports filed with the registrar. Relevant authorities have been notified; a complaint has also been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore and to the FBI.

If you interacted with this site or were targeted through similar methods, consider submitting a report to https://www.ic3.gov and contacting your regional cybercrime unit.

When the market starts moving up and even these people begin to go quiet, then turn neutral, then bullish that’s your signal.

It’s not perfect, but it’s surprisingly accurate. When the loudest bears start to flip, the risk-reward is no longer the same.

There’s no hype, no new narratives, no wild altcoin rallies. Search interest for “Bitcoin,” “crypto prices,” or even popular influencers is at a multi-month low. You feel it. I feel it. Feeds are dry. Engagement is down. And that’s exactly when you should be paying attention. Because here’s what most people forget: the best opportunities never show up in the middle of euphoria. They show up in silence.

When nobody’s watching.
When your friends have stopped talking about it.
When your Twitter feed is about politics or memes instead of charts.
When influencers go on vacation.
When even solid coins barely move.

That’s when serious investors start building positions.
Not because of hype. But because they understand the rhythm of this space.

Look at search trends or social mentions. The spikes don’t come first, they come after the price moves.
Most people search for “how to buy crypto” when Bitcoin is hitting $60k, not $20k.
They look for “top altcoins” after a 200% pump, not before it. That’s human nature.
And that’s why most people always arrive late.

Smart money accumulates during boredom.
Retail shows up during headlines.

Here's My  Take,Gullible-Tale9114,4,26,2025-06-23 05:36:53,"Iran's Parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz ,, waterway that handles about 20% of global oil trade. Markets initially tanked... we saw $450 million in liquidations (some sources saying over $1B when you factor in all the cascading effects), and then... we bounced.

BTC currently sitting around $101K range after that initial drop…

Here's my  thesis :

Every. Single. War. Is. Manufactured.
Every big world scare is engineered to create these exact market conditions. They tank the markets, liquidate the overleveraged retail crowd, and then... whoosh... the printer gets turned on and they buy everything back at discount prices with freshly minted money.

Think about it logically... the final decision to close the strait lies with Iran's national security council, NOT the parliament. This is political theater designed to create volatility. Closing Hormuz would hurt Iran's own economy since they export through there too, and it would piss off China (their biggest oil buyer).

So why the vote? Because they NEED the fear narrative to justify the next round of monetary expansion.

Bitcoin's Role in All This:

BTC is going to be the primary beneficiary of this entire charade. While traditional markets get whipped by geopolitical nonsense, Bitcoin continues to prove it's the ultimate hedge against coordinated financial manipulation.

Analysts are projecting $100K-$120K trading range in the short term, but I think we're going much higher when the it all settles(if)  .The 2025 prediction range of $100K-$150K is looking conservative if my thesis is correct.

The liquidation flush we just saw? That's exactly what they wanted. Over $1.9 billion in liquidations across crypto derivatives over the past week according to some reports. I've been tracking all this volatility and the resulting trades through Awaken.tax they actually handles these complex DeFi positions and liquidation events properly,

UPDATE - 24 Hours Later:
And there it is. Trump announces an Israel-Iran ceasefire just as quickly as this escalated. The timing couldn't be more textbook,, create the crisis, flush out the overleveraged positions, then resolve it once the desired market effect is achieved;;

The Strait of Hormuz ""threat"" evaporated as predicted. Iran's parliament vote was never going to be the final word exactly as outlined above. The National Security Council holds that authority, and economic reality (their own oil exports + China relationship) made closure unlikely from the start...

Markets are already stabilizing, BTC holding strong above $100K, and the liquidation event served its purpose. The pattern repeats itself with precision: manufactured volatility, retail flushout, institutonal accumulation at discounted prices.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1li8nvu/iran_approved_closing_strait_of_hormuz_bitcoin/,4,1,1,BTC,positive

# Bitcoin Plunges Below $100K Amid Market Turmoil, Yet Institutional Buying Persists

The crypto market experienced significant turbulence as Bitcoin dipped below $100,000, triggering over $1.79 billion in liquidations. This downturn followed US military action against Iran, causing widespread market panic. Despite the dip, institutional interest remains strong, with Metaplanet purchasing 1,111 BTC, bringing their holdings to over $1.1 billion. Michael Saylor's firm also added 245 BTC for $26 million, showcasing continued confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Amidst the volatility, crypto funds reported $1.2 billion in inflows, and major exchanges like OKX are eyeing Wall Street IPOs. Analysts offer mixed predictions, with some warning of further downside and others, like Arthur Hayes, suggesting the weakness is temporary. The market's focus now shifts to potential recovery and the ongoing debate about ""paper bitcoin"" held by institutions.

# Fiserv's FIUSD Stablecoin Platform to Democratize Digital Currency Access for Smaller Banks

Fiserv is set to launch FIUSD, a new stablecoin platform, by year-end, granting over 3,000 regional and community banks access to the growing stablecoin market.

PUBLISHED
JUN 23, 2025 6:00AM EDT
--News Direct--

A new financial playbook is emerging among public companies in 2025: replace traditional cash reserves with crypto assets. Once considered fringe, crypto treasury strategies—allocating corporate capital to digital currencies—are rapidly going mainstream.

The shift began with MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin purchases in 2020, but this year, the trend has accelerated across multiple blockchains. From large caps to speculative tech players, companies are turning to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and newer entrants like Sonic coin to protect against inflation, earn yield, and attract a new generation of investors.

What was once an eccentric bet has now evolved into a diversified movement. Public companies are not just buying crypto—they’re staking it, building validator infrastructure, and generating passive yield. For investors, these businesses offer exchange-listed exposure to digital assets, often with strategic advantages like regulatory clarity, leverage, or ecosystem access.

Below are four companies at the forefront of this movement.

1. Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)—The Bitcoin Benchmark

Formerly known as MicroStrategy, Strategy is the original corporate crypto bull. As of June 2025, the company holds 580,955 BTC, valued at approximately $61.4 billion USD, making it the largest public holder of Bitcoin by far.

Its strategy is unapologetically aggressive: borrow capital through convertible notes and share offerings, then deploy that cash into Bitcoin. Strategy treats BTC as a superior treasury reserve asset, betting on its long-term appreciation over fiat. CEO Michael Saylor has framed the move as both a hedge against inflation and a bold capital allocation thesis.

This leveraged Bitcoin position has fundamentally changed the company’s identity. No longer judged on software revenues, Strategy now trades as a quasi–Bitcoin ETF with embedded operational leverage. Its stock has soared nearly 3,000% since initiating the pivot, becoming a proxy for institutional BTC exposure and a playbook many are beginning to replicate.

2. Spetz Inc. (CSE: SPTZ | OTC: DBKSF)—The Sonic Coin Specialist

Spetz Inc. is at the vanguard of next-generation altcoin treasury strategies, centered on Sonic coin ($S)—the native token of the Sonic blockchain, a high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 network gaining traction in developer activity and decentralized finance.

As of June 2025, Spetz holds 6 million $S tokens purchased at an average of $0.39 USD, giving it a crypto treasury valued at over $3.3 million CAD. Instead of simply holding tokens, the company operates a Sonic validator node—earning an estimated 4.62% APY in staking rewards while directly supporting the chain’s security and governance.

This validator model turns idle capital into a productive asset, creating a recurring yield stream and positioning Spetz as a core infrastructure player in a fast-scaling blockchain ecosystem. The company is also exploring additional yield strategies, including smart contract–enabled staking pools and integrations with Sonic-native DeFi protocols—marking a shift from passive tokenholder to active crypto-native allocator.

In May, Spetz completed a $10 million CAD private placement to accelerate this strategy. The funds will support validator expansion, token accumulation, and deeper integration with the Sonic ecosystem. The company is also evaluating cross-chain staking and yield aggregation across upcoming Sonic Layer 2 networks, reinforcing its long-term vision as an infrastructure-driven treasury operator.

For investors, Spetz offers early-stage, high-conviction exposure to one of 2025’s most closely watched altcoin ecosystems. It provides not just financial exposure but operational leverage: token upside, staking rewards, and protocol-level participation—all without the friction or custodial risk of managing crypto assets directly.

3. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET)—Ethereum’s Corporate Powerhouse

SharpLink Gaming made headlines—and waves—when it pivoted from gaming tech to Ethereum treasury accumulation. In Q2 2025, it raised $425 million USD via PIPE financing and deployed it into 176,271 ETH, making it the largest public Ethereum holder globally.

More than 95% of its ETH is staked, earning rewards via both native and liquid staking protocols. This approach is less about trading and more about long-term ETH accumulation with a recurring income stream, backed by validator rewards and DeFi integrations.

Initially, markets were caught off guard—the stock dropped over 90% post-pivot—but SharpLink has since clarified its roadmap. With ties to Joseph Lubin and Consensys, the company is carving out a unique niche as a Web3-native treasury allocator, betting that Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling, restaking protocols, and yield dynamics will compound value over time.

4. DeFi Development Corp. (NASDAQ: DFDV)—Solana’s Institutional Backer

DeFi Development Corp., formerly Janover Inc., is executing one of the boldest Solana-centric treasury strategies in the public markets. With a treasury of 609,190 SOL and a recent purchase of 16,447 SOL at $139.66 USD, DFDV is following a familiar blueprint: accumulate, stake, and wait for the ecosystem to appreciate.

The company has aligned itself closely with the Solana developer community and is reportedly exploring participation in validator nodes, staking pools, and liquidity provision—integrating deeper into the Solana DeFi stack. While its proposed $1 billion shelf offering has been paused, the ambition signals long-term conviction.

By focusing on Solana—a chain known for speed, composability, and capital efficiency—DeFi Development is positioning itself as a yield-generating treasury operator with upside to network expansion. For investors, it’s one of the only ways to gain institutional-grade SOL exposure through an equity listing.

Why Crypto Treasuries Matter in 2025

The rapid adoption of crypto treasury strategies reflects deeper shifts in how companies view capital. In a world of rising inflation, fiat dilution, and evolving investor preferences, holding cash—or even gold—is no longer enough. Digital assets offer not only appreciation potential but also yield, strategic alignment with Web3 ecosystems, and investor interest.

Still, risks remain. Crypto markets are volatile, regulatory clarity varies, and altcoin-specific exposures can be speculative. But for companies willing to take the risk, the rewards have been substantial.

For investors, these stocks offer a rare blend of public equity liquidity and crypto upside—without needing to manage wallets, private keys, or gas fees. As the crypto treasury model matures, expect more companies to follow suit—and more headlines to follow them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lj332p/public_companies_are_turning_to_crypto_4_stocks/,5,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",positive

His parents are in their early 70s, just sold their house, and between the proceeds from the sale and what little they had in savings, they are giving him about $450,000 to invest. They are going to be renting and he’s convinced them he can give them big returns so they can live comfortably for the rest of their life. 

He told me their only income is around $1,800–$2,000 a month from Social Security, and this investment money is basically all of their savings.

He’s convinced ATOM is a slam dunk to make his parents multimillionaires. He keeps saying that the 15% staking reward is like a guaranteed dividend and that he’ll turn this into $1.4 million easily. I tried explaining that staking yield is not a promise of gains, it doesn’t protect you if the token tanks. But his response was basically “why would it tank”. But he doesn’t see the risk. He’s treating this like a total slam dunk. 

I’m honestly worried. These are his parents’ retirement funds. They don’t have time to recover if this goes south. English isn’t their first language so I’m worried he’s taking advantage of them and is a delusional narcissist. Do you know of any good articles or material I could send him to maybe change his mind. It might not be possible to if he’s as delusional as I think he may be, but I figured it’s just worth a shot. I asked him why he had to invest every single dollar into ATOM and he was like trying to make it out like what he’s doing is some noble thing to help his parents out. But I think he’s delusional. He’s never made any money on anything probably hasn’t made more than 30 or $40,000 in a year and he thinks he is an expert on investments because he read a little bit on the Internet.

1ljfx3c,"Basel III, ISO 20022, and the Future of Instant Settlement—Why July Matters More Than You Think",RadiantWarden,11,21,2025-06-24 16:35:49,"
July 2025 will not look dramatic on a price chart, but it may be the most consequential month for the financial plumbing underlying every market, crypto included. As regulatory deadlines converge, banks, custodians, and liquidity providers are preparing for a shift that most retail investors are still missing.

Over the past decade, the backbone of global payments has been held together by legacy messaging and settlement systems such as SWIFT, Fedwire, and CHIPS. These often operate with days-long settlement times, fragmented reconciliation, and costly inefficiencies. That structure is about to be replaced. The US Fedwire system will fully integrate ISO 20022 messaging on July 14, 2025. This move synchronizes it with global payment highways and opens the rails for instant, programmable settlement of not just fiat, but digital assets and tokenized financial products.

This is not a tech upgrade for its own sake. It is a regulatory demand, arriving in tandem with the Basel III Endgame. On July 1, new liquidity and capital requirements go live, forcing banks to show not only that they have the assets, but that those assets can be mobilized and settled instantly under stress. The days of slow reconciliations and delayed exposures are ending. If you cannot settle in seconds, your capital will cost you more.

Against this backdrop, banks are now required to develop contingency liquidity plans in advance of the ISO 20022 cutover. This is a clear sign that institutions are not only anticipating technical friction, but are bracing for sudden shifts in where and how liquidity is sourced and settled.

At the same time, tokenized real-world assets are quietly going live on distributed ledgers. In June, Ondo Finance launched over $5.9 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries on a blockchain protocol designed for institutional flows. Settlement infrastructure such as Axiology is being piloted for sovereign debt issuance and delivery-versus-payment, integrating digital asset rails directly into existing capital markets. Most of this is not happening on Ethereum, and it is not visible to the casual observer. It is institutional, quiet, and deliberately compliant with the new rules.

These converging trends; programmable settlement, regulatory liquidity, and live tokenized assets-suggest that a new settlement backbone is being activated beneath the surface of public markets. Certain digital assets, previously dismissed as just another altcoin, are already being woven into the fabric of these experiments. While retail focuses on narratives and ETFs, the institutions are quietly shifting their own rails.

This is not a prediction of a sudden bull market or a call to buy any particular asset. Instead, it is a warning that the game is moving beneath everyone’s feet. When Fedwire flips the switch in July and Basel III capital rules are enforced, the winners will not be those chasing the loudest headlines but those already positioned in compliant, instant-settlement infrastructure.

———

TLDR: July 2025 brings the intersection of real-time regulatory deadlines, ISO 20022 integration, and the institutional launch of tokenized assets. Liquidity, compliance, and settlement speed are becoming the new market alpha. The rails are changing and the shift is already underway.

If you are interested in more macro or protocol-level perspectives on how settlement infrastructure is evolving, let me know. I am always looking to compare notes and get feedback from other market watchers.

Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deeper into the passive income streams that crypto offers and I’m genuinely interested in what I’ve seen. More and more people are earning returns by holding their assets on different platforms. Whether it’s through staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols, the options for making your crypto work for you have expanded a lot.
I’ve seen platforms offering 4–10% APY on stablecoins, and even higher rates on native tokens and altcoins.

So, in order for me to do my research in the right way, I’m curious to hear from others who’ve jumped into this side of the market:

What platforms or methods are you using to generate yield?

What kind of returns have you seen?

Any tips for maximizing passive income with minimal management?

BTC is literally mirroring March 2020 . Small dip > recovery > BTC and alts rally together…

All of crypto twitter is obsessing over Iran/Israel situation and how it's gonna crash everything... but they're looking at this way too narrow. This exact same shit happened before... it's just repeating if you zoom out far enough
Current geopolitical mess is subsequel to COVID crash but different flavor. Yeah obviously war tensions and pandemic panic are different things... but the market reaction is pretty much identical:

Sharp selloff from fear

Everyone goes risk-off mode

Global uncertainty hits markets

Quick recovery once the fear subsides

The catalysts are already aligning
For this rally to really take off we need bullish catalysts that kill the uncertainty... 

Rate cuts  (coming whether Powell admits it or not) 

Iran/Israel ceasefire  (Trump literally told both sides they ""don't know what the fuck they're doing"" lmao) 

Holding key support levels ($100k held like a champ)

Powell said no rate cuts today... but come on, Trump needs them and he's gonna get them. Same pattern as March 2020 when Fed did those emergency cuts. After 12 days of intense back and forth, we got that fragile ceasefire... Trump basically told both countries to sit the fuck down and they listened

Most important thing was BTC holding $100k support... which it did. Now we're already pushing through $105k and ETH is recovering fast too. Been documenting these moves through Awaken.tax since the volatility creates some wild DeFi interactions that need proper tracking 

Short term: expecting consolidation between $102k-$106k... nothing goes straight up. Medium term: breakout to $120k ATH sometime November December probably sooner than most people think

Hi everyone,
I’m a guy who started investing in crypto back in 2019, from zero.
I bought my first $500 worth of BTC when the price was around $8,500. From that moment on, I’ve been studying, learning everything on my own. No one taught me — I learned by making mistakes, losing money, and staying committed.

In 2020, I discovered DeFi and lived through the bull run. Like many, I spent hundreds of dollars on Ethereum gas fees, invested in bad projects, held onto assets too long. But I never gave up. I never sold, not even during the worst parts of the bear market.

My long-term goal has always been the same: to quit my day job and work full-time in crypto.

In 2024, after years of saving and building, I was scammed. I lost 4.5 ETH through a malicious smart contract.
I never clicked shady links, never shared my seed phrase.
But I made one critical mistake: keeping nearly all of my funds on a single hot wallet.

In just a few hours, I lost almost €14,000 — basically everything I had.

But I’m not giving up.
With a close friend, I’ve started studying again, every day — researching new projects, seeking early opportunities, being extremely cautious. I’m now more focused on safety, wallet management, and practical contribution.

To rebuild, I’m offering my skills.
I’m not asking for donations. I want to work.

	•	Community help, microtasks, data entry, research, airdrop claims

Because this isn’t a free-flowing market anymore. It’s a structured ignition zone. Here’s what’s likely happening behind the curtain:

1. **ETF inflows are real.** Institutions and sovereign players are absorbing supply through cold storage. That BTC isn’t coming back to exchanges.

2. **Exchange liquidity is mostly paper.** What you’re seeing on the order books is often IOUs—fractional reserves of “paper bitcoin” without full backing. Real coin is scarce.

3. **Whales are rotating silently.** Early miners, large OTC wallets—they’re feeding liquidity in a way that avoids slippage or visible demand shocks. It’s stealth accumulation.

4. **Volatility suppression is intentional.** Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity need a stable BTC price environment for regulatory approvals, integration into tradfi systems, and settlement infrastructure buildout.

5. **The real breakout is postponed.** This isn’t about chasing hype. Once it escapes velocity and runs, it becomes unreachable to most. The door closes.

In short: **This market is being positioned, not traded.**

The illusion of stagnation hides an enormous structural transition.

1lmq3c4,Theory of XRP,_JJ_7,0,42,2025-06-28 15:52:10,"I have an interesting theory about XRP and I’d love to hear your opinion on it.

I’m fairly confident that the current price of XRP is just the tip of the iceberg, and while I'm not trying to predict a specific price here, I believe something much bigger is coming.

Let me explain my theory, based on a few key points.

Ripple vs. SEC:

Since the SEC dropped nearly all charges against Ripple and settled for a much lower amount than originally demanded, I believe there's no longer any room for the SEC to claim that XRP should be classified as a security instead of a cryptocurrency.

Historically, the SEC has made some questionable moves, like the acceptance of the Madoff scandal, and while I agree that the SEC’s actions have often been questionable, I don't see them filing another lawsuit against Ripple anytime soon. Under the current U.S. presidency, which is more crypto-friendly, I don't expect any major legal issues for Ripple in the near future.

U.S. Crypto-Friendly Policy:

With Trump, the U.S. had a president who was a strong believer in cryptocurrency. While I’m not entirely sure, it seems that under Trump, XRP was even considered for use as a crypto reserve asset, similar to gold? (Again, I’m not from the U.S., so I’m not 100% certain here.)

Additionally, U.S. policy has helped attract international investment into crypto, particularly XRP. For example, the Saudi Arabian energy company, owned by the Saudi Prince, invested $121 million in XRP.

Ripple’s Strategy:

Now we get into some details. Ripple has capped the total supply of XRP at 100 billion coins, with around 59 billion currently in circulation. As transactions occur, a small number of XRP coins are burned (currently around 0.0007 XRP per transaction, if I recall correctly).

Imagine this scenario: Cryptocurrency is still relatively new, and not everyone fully understands the technology behind it. As more people become aware of the potential of blockchain, more XRP coins will be burned with each transaction. This could result in a significant reduction in supply over the next 5-15 years.

Ripple designed XRP to facilitate cheap, fast payments between banks and financial institutions. Many of these institutions already acknowledge XRP as a viable payment tool, and this is why Ripple has partnered with several major banks and financial institutions.

The Greed Factor:

I've seen it happen over and over again: Many people invest in things without truly understanding them, simply because there’s a hype around it. They hear about others making insane profits from a few speculations and think, “It’ll work for me too!” But they don't do their own research. They jump in at the latest phases, when the real community (the ones who do due diligence) has already taken their profits.

My Hypothesis:

Let’s tie this all together with a simple hypothesis:

Right now, an estimated 10-20 million people are using XRP. But what if XRP becomes so widely adopted that the number of users increases dramatically—let’s say to 1 billion people?

How much would the price of XRP rise then? How many coins would be burned with those transactions?

Summary:

To summarize, I believe the price of XRP could potentially multiply by a significant factor in the future. This is due to factors like political acceptance, growing adoption by financial institutions and banks, technological advancements, and an artificial scarcity created by the burning of coins as more users adopt XRP.

But again, this is just my theory. What do you all think? Do you believe it's worth getting involved, or should we stay away?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lmq3c4/theory_of_xrp/,0,1,1,XRP,positive
1lnlvfm,BTC exchange balances continue collapsing and are at the lowest level in 6 years,northernBladee,117,37,2025-06-29 18:31:05,"BTC balances across centralized exchanges dropped below 2.7 million by April 25, 2025 and since then it’s been a straight up decline, hitting around 2.1 million BTC by June. That’s just about 10% of Bitcoin’s total supply sitting on exchanges right now. The lowest levels we’ve seen since 2018-2019. For context, there were over 3 million BTC on exchanges just two years ago

And the timing with price action says it all. Bitcoin ripped from under $40K to over $100K as exchange reserves kept draining. When liquid supply gets squeezed this hard and institutional demand stays steady, basic economics kicks in

But here’s what really makes this cycle different. It’s not retail chasing pumps or panic-selling. The BTC isn’t coming back. It’s being systematically pulled into corporate treasuries, ETFs and long-term institutional cold storage. That’s sticky supply

I was tracking my own holdings with awaken.tax and even small holders are moving coins off exchanges. Everyone's going cold storage now... institutional playbook tricking down to retail..

Post-halving, only 450 BTC are mined daily. Meanwhile institutional buyers (the Saylor types) are scooping up way more than that. When demand eats up multiple times the new supply and the available float keeps shrinking, somethings gotta give

This could be the first time in Bitcoin’s history where the biggest constraint isn’t demand, it’s liquid supply. The supply shock everyone used to talk about as a theory? It’s happening right now in real time

1lnnse1,Saylor posting the orange dot tracker again,Standard_Olive_717,8,3,2025-06-29 19:50:12,"
Saylor dropped his Bitcoin tracker insights emphasizing a 21-year investment horizon
But what makes this particularly interesting is the context. MicroStrategy already holds 478,000 BTC( approx)  worth roughly $30.4 billion, making them one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world. Yet Saylor's recent comments about Bitcoin reaching $21 million by 2046 suggest he's nowhere near done accumulating.

The orange dot tracker has essentially become his signature move before major purchase announcements. ""Bigger orange dots, better"" was his message last time, and that preceded a massive buying spree that further reduced liquid Bitcoin supply.

So here's the real question  are we about to see another institutional supply shock,  Given that exchange balances are already at 6 year lows and any significant MicroStrategy purchase could push available Bitcoin below critical liquidity thresholds, Monday's potential announcement could be more significant than usual.

The market's learned to read these signals as advance notice of buying pressure that's about to hit. When someone who's systematically removed nearly 500,000 Bitcoin from circulation starts posting tracker updates, the more Bitcoin is about to disappear into permanent treasury holdings.

What's your take? are we potentially looking at a supply shock catalyst that could push Bitcoin into serious price discovery territory?

* Coinbase **wrapped** the BTC into cbBTC

Kraken confirmed they don’t control this wallet. Coinbase won’t escalate the case. My formal complaint — **Case #23628170** — has gone nowhere.

Trump just pushed through this massive tax-and-spend bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill, and it’s going to flood the market with even more dollars.

When the money supply goes up like this, the dollar gets weaker, and everything priced in USD feels the pressure.

At the same time, the dominance charts are telling a story. Bitcoin dominance is expected to drop big, and stablecoins like USDT and USDC are losing ground too. That means money is moving out of stablecoins and back into BTC and ETH. This isn’t just retail hype but theinstitutions are gearing up too.

And then there’s Solana. They just rolled out a huge update where you can now swap SOL for tokenized stocks right in Phantom and use those stocks inside DeFi. This is not just a cool feature; it’s a real sign that traditional finance is moving straight into crypto.

What does all this mean? 
The dollar printing continues which pushes inflation higher and drives demand for crypto as a hedge. Rising money supply and the shift in dominance show fresh money flowing into Bitcoin and Ethereum. With TradFi moving in through Solana, institutions are entering fast. Your retail edge is getting smaller by the day.

If you’re watching from the sidelines, just know this edge won’t last forever. With Wall Street getting full access, and prices like ETH under 3k or SOL under 150, those huge 100x meme coin moves will likely be a thing of the past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1lqi5sy/this_could_be_the_last_real_crypto_cycle_retail/,124,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",positive

Hope you're all having a solid trading day! Just wanted to share what I'm seeing with BTCUSD right now and get some of your seasoned takes.

Looking at my chart (It's a 15-minute timeframe for clear price action), Bitcoin had a bit of a reset overnight, testing what looks like a pretty robust support level around the 108,400 mark. From that point, the buyers stepped in aggressively.

We've seen a really strong push upwards, decisively breaking out of what was a prior consolidation range/resistance zone (roughly 108,700-108,800). The current momentum is undeniable, and the candle formations are looking pretty healthy for the bulls.

My bias here is bullish, given the clean break and follow-through. I entered a couple of long positions earlier today, one at 108,634.84 and another at 108,642.04. Both are sitting in decent profit right now, which is always nice! My eyes are set on a target around 110,478.61, riding this current upward wave.

What are your technical observations on this move? Are you seeing strong volume confirming the breakout? Any key resistance levels you're watching further up? Always great to hear diverse perspectives on the market structure.

But if the S&R for BTC are the important measures even for alts, then is there any point tracking indicators on the alts? It would seem not. But this isn't correct anyway, because sometimes the alts don't move in lock-step to BTC. 

In fact, if you map BTC onto, e.g. NVIDIA or Palantir, you will see that there is consistency and overlap there too.

But I downloaded OKX Wallet yesterday and added my wallet that I had on my iPhone.

The image is dated for the 2024, so its imposible that is one for one of my wallets or that I got it from the internet because as far as I know if I do

1lydsai,Why altcoins underperform BTC: imagine permanent sell limit orders,FinanceML,14,30,2025-07-12 23:08:21,"Let's do a thought experiment.

Currently Strategy holds \~3% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is \~$70k. Michael Saylor says he plans to never sell bitcoin. Also, 95% of total bitcoin supply is in circulation now - only \~5% left to be mined.

What would happen if Saylor changes his mind and decides to start selling, say, up to 50% of his BTC holdings at exactly $120k price (as an example)? You can imagine this as a **permanent sell limit order** with the price of $120k and enormous volume (1.5% of supply). Of course, technically it doesn't look like that, but conceptually it's the same: every time the price goes to $120k, the big seller would arrive and drive it back down.  
**The price would likely not go past $120k for a while** \- because even when demand grows, MSTR will always be there to sell some more of their bag at $120k.

**And now imagine** if Strategy held not 3%, but 30% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is not $70k, but $7k. And Saylor's goal is to make money in short/medium term, so he's ready to sell every time the price goes up. Heck, he could even sell when the price is stable or goes down - he would still make a lot of money on top of $7k cost basis. Just need to not sell a lot at once, because that would scare retail investors.

Could BTC ever keep going up under such conditions?

**This is what happens with most altcoins**. It has nothing to do with the tech itself. The tech can be awesome, but the token ownership incentivizes early investors to sell whenever the demand grows, limiting the price growth potential. And that will continue to happen until they sell their big bags, which can be 50% of total token supply, or even more.

**What about memecoins?** Don't they have a more fair token distribution? Not really. They still have founders and early adopters - lucky people who got 1%+ of supply each for minimal prices. When the price goes 10x-100x and the token enters, say, top 100 of CMC - they will start to sell, limiting the price growth.

How can we identify altcoins that can outperform BTC in the long run? There is no guarantee, but here are a few metrics that we can look at, and compare it with BTC.

**1. % of supply in circulation.** Every time a token unlock happens, early investors get the token for free -  so they will always be incentivized to sell, driving the price down. If the token has, say, <80% in circulation, we can't expect the price to outperform BTC just because of this reason. BTC has 95%.

**2. % of supply held by whales**. A whale in CMC terminology is a wallet that holds >1% of total token supply. So if this number is, say, higher than 10%, we can expect that whale to sell when demand grows, to make profit. For BTC only 1.25% of total supply is controlled by whales.

**3. Historical price action in BTC.** There were big waves of retail demand for altcoins in the past. We can look at price of the token in BTC, not USD. For most of altcoins, it has a clear pattern: there is a surge every few years, and then a slow drop. And the surges usually get lower, and drops get deeper. Unless the tech makes a groundbreaking advancement and adoption explodes, we can expect the pattern to continue. And just to be clear, the adoption has to be bigger than the adoption for BTC. Because the whales holding 1%+ of supply will keep selling, so the demand needs to smash past that. It's much harder for altcoins than for BTC just because there are typically much bigger whales in terms of % of supply held.

Here is the analysis of top 20 coins (CMC data):

**So is there any reason to invest in altcoins at all?**

I think the tech has potential, but projects should be selected very carefully. I don't think it makes sense to invest in projects with <80% supply in circulation (unless you're a huge believer in the specific tech) or with >10% held by whales. However, there is one exception to the last point. It is possible that the project foundation controls the large portion of supply (e.g. ETH, TRX), but they can be trusted that they won't limit the price action by constantly selling. I think TRX is the best example of this. Justin Sun controls \~70% of token supply, however apparently he makes the TRX price action follow the BTC price, so the TRX graph in BTC is quite stable since \~2020.

So even though TRX does not outperform BTC, at least it follows it. It's a rare exception for projects with large % of token supply controlled by whales. I think it's not a coincidence that Sun was [giving advice](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/01/22/justin-sun-claims-he-can-take-ethereum-to-10000/) to ETH foundation on how to keep the price up. And still, it does not guarantee that the whales won't dump their bags if adoption explodes and demand suddenly goes up. They might make sure the graph in BTC stays consistent, and still sell the excess of supply - so retail investors still won't make more money than they could in BTC.

Bitcoin’s hitting new highs with strong buying volume but the 24-hour long and short data shows retail traders are mostly short while whales stay heavily long. Since retail is mostly short here my guess is we’re probably getting shafted as usual. If BTC holds support and funding rates turn favorable there could be a short squeeze that pushes prices higher but history tells me retail often gets caught on the wrong side.

Retail shorts get squeezed hard when prices move against them but retail longs can also get hit if whales start unloading or the market turns. Either way retail traders will most likely end up on the losing side because they don’t have the same information or patience as the big players.

I remember the previous runs and the cultural wave they had on retail interest doesn’t seem to exist as much.

However, it is not bad necessarily. The retail fomo and SM hype also acted as catalysts in previous runs. But the multiple boom cycles may have created a new boring normal to mainstream adoption. Furthermore, Financial Twitter has shifted focus to AI stocks (NVIDIA, OpenAI) and politics from btc as nvidia and other techs are riding the ai hype train. Also, psychological aspects such as btc rise from 60k to 100k is less emotionally and attentively impactful as 1k to 20k. 

The institutional money flowing into Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries has fundamentally altered the market dynamics too. Tools like awaken.tax are becoming more relevant as traders move from speculative plays to actual portfolio management. When MicroStrategy or BlackRock buys Bitcoin, it doesn't create the same viral social media moments as retail investors discovering crypto for the first time. These institutional purchases happen quietly, methodically, without the memes and excitement that drove previous cycles. It's efficient but sterile - the kind of adoption we wanted but perhaps didn't expect would feel so... corporate.

According to the company’s CEO, Rick Wurster, both BTC and ETH will become meaningful long-term growth drivers for the company.

Wurster initially revealed Schwab’s plans to start spot crypto trading last November and reiterated the plans in the firm’s Spring 2025 Business Update. At the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the US.

“Our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that,” Wurster said. 

In addition to trading services, Wurster revealed that Schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. He said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. This suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure.

“Stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “We will have a stablecoin at some point.”

1m47kyq,why Solana might actually flip eth (and why it probably won't happen soon),hodorrny,0,32,2025-07-19 21:29:11,"Look, the numbers don't lie. When you can do the same transaction on Solana for cents instead of tens of dollars on Ethereum, that's a massive advantage.. eth gas fees are a total pain. Like, why pay a fortune for the same thing when SOL does it quicker and for less? someone mentioned on one of the threads dropping $150 on a new ERC20 memecoin launch and getting hit with $94 in gas fees. that’s nyts.When you're tracking all these transactions for tax reporting with tools like awaken.tax, those gas fees really add up and eat into your actual gains. Solana's speed is also insane compared to ETH. Everything feels instant, and when you're trying to catch a quick trade or mint something, those seconds matter. The whole network just feels more responsive for actual usage.

But here's why ETH isn't going anywhere anytime soon:-
The developer ecosystem is just massive. We're talking about thousands of developers who have spent years building on Ethereum, creating tools, learning the ins and outs of smart contracts, building entire careers around it. That doesn't just disappear overnight.
All those dApps, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces - they're not going to migrate easily. There's so much infrastructure built on Ethereum that moving would be like rebuilding the entire internet from scratch.
If Solana does flip Ethereum, we're probably looking at 2028-2029 at the earliest. Maybe longer. These things take time, and network effects are incredibly powerful in crypto. Bitcoin is still #1 despite having way worse tech than newer chains, purely because it was first.

What do you think? Am I missing something about why ETH will stay dominant, or do you see the same shift happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1m47kyq/why_solana_might_actually_flip_eth_and_why_it/,0,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",neutral
1m4wymz,Forget the Blockchain Trilemma: Kaspa Is Unlocking New Dimensions in Crypto,ClassicReal123,39,32,2025-07-20 18:57:29,"[https://i.imgur.com/yJ69kfM.png](https://i.imgur.com/yJ69kfM.png)

For a long time, the crypto community, as articulated by Vitalik Buterin, believed in the **Blockchain Trilemma**: the idea that achieving scalability, security, and decentralization together was impossible, forcing a trade-off. But what if there's a fourth critical element often overlooked: **sustainability**? Many sacrificed decentralization with Proof-of-Stake, some compromised security and hindered speed with sharding, and others opted for layer 2 solutions.

Let's find out how Kaspa offers a much better balance than other projects, tackling not just the original three, but adding sustainability to the mix.

# 1. Decentralization That Works

Kaspa launched 100% fair with no shady pre-mines, no VC handouts, and no insider deals. It is truly permissionless, relying on pure **Proof-of-Work** mining, meaning anyone can join and run a node. Thanks to Kaspa’s fast block times, solo mining is a thing - it's actually profitable, giving individuals a real shot without relying on mining pools. With Kaspa, the power stays distributed. It’s the people's crypto, and always will be.

# 2. Security at Warp Speed

Thanks to its revolutionary **GHOSTDAG** protocol, co-authored by computer scientist Yonatan Sompolinsky (whose work contributed to Bitcoin through academic papers, and his GHOST protocol was even used in Ethereum), Kaspa maintains incredible security. This means your transactions are confirmed with the highest level of trust. No more wondering if your funds are safe.

# 3. Scalability Unlocked

Traditional blockchains are like a single-lane road, getting congested quickly. Kaspa's **BlockDAG** technology is like building a multi-lane highway, allowing multiple blocks to be created and confirmed in parallel. This isn't some theoretical promise; Kaspa is already handling thousands of transactions per second, blowing past networks like Solana *without* resorting to tricks like inflated voting transactions to pump TPS. We're talking real, uncompromised speed, with 10 blocks per second today and 100 BPS coming!

For context, [Kaspa ranks as the fastest Layer 1 crypto](https://kaspahub.org/article/fastest-cryptocurrencies/) among top cryptocurrencies with current 100-millisecond block times.

# 4. Sustainable for the Long Haul

Unlike Bitcoin, which faces ongoing debate around its 'tail emission' and future miner incentives, Kaspa is fundamentally designed for long-term sustainability. Its support for **pruned nodes** significantly lowers storage requirements, making it easier and more accessible for anyone to run a node. This, combined with its energy-efficient design and high transaction throughput, supports a future where transaction fees become a significant income stream, ensuring the network remains strong and decentralized for generations.

**Kaspa isn't just a coin; it's a movement.** It's built by brilliant minds focused on creating a truly decentralized, secure, scalable, and sustainable digital cash system. While the old guard is fighting over scraps, Kaspa is quietly building the future of money.

Don't be left behind. This is your chance to front-run the smart money.

Stack. Hold. Tell everyone.

Kaspa is the real deal.

# TLDR:

Kaspa's solves **blockchain quadrilemma** \- which includes sustainability, an aspect often avoided by most projects.

good stuff: Bitcoin reserve proposal - If the government starts holding Bitcoin alongside their gold reserves, that would mean that btc has real value in US economical terms.

Fed access for crypto companies - This is huge but boring. Right now, crypto companies have to go through regular banks to move dollars around, which creates delays and extra costs. Direct Fed access means faster, cheaper transactions. Better user experience, lower fees for us.

basically Expect volatility around the announcement as markets love clarity. If this goes well, it removes a lot of regulatory overhang that's been suppressing prices. Institutional adoption becomes easier when the rules are clear. One side benefit of clearer regulations is that tax compliance should get easier too. Right now everyone's guessing at how to report crypto transactions, but solid regulatory framework means platforms like awaken.tax can build better tools knowing the rules won't change every six months. Less regulatory confusion equals better user experience across the board.

the bottom line is that this feels like a turning point. Either crypto gets the regulatory clarity it needs to explode, or we get buried under bureaucracy. The July 30 report won't give us all the answers, but it'll show us which direction we're headed.

1m8pdes,The Bitcoin Bloodbath: Why Whales Just Set the Stage for a Monster Rally. $BTC falls to 116K in minutes!,RobArrucha,1,4,2025-07-25 04:03:52,"What the hell just happened?



If you watched Bitcoin’s price action today, you might have felt a jolt of panic. A sudden, gut-wrenching plunge that sent the price tumbling and social media into a frenzy. It looked like a classic crypto crash—but it wasn’t.



What you just witnessed was a masterclass in market manipulation, a strategic “shakeout” orchestrated by the giants of the crypto world—the whales. And if you understand their game, you’ll see this bloodbath wasn’t an ending. It was a beginning. In fact, it's the clearest sign we have that a significant price spike is likely on the horizon.



1. The Anatomy of a Takedown

First, let’s break down what happened. This wasn’t random selling. It was a targeted strike. Using sophisticated tools like liquidation heatmaps, large traders can see exactly where massive pools of ""leveraged long"" positions are sitting. These are essentially bets from smaller traders that the price will go up, but they've borrowed money to amplify their bet. It’s risky, and the whales know it.



This week, the heatmap was lit up like a Christmas tree, showing billions of dollars in these leveraged positions just below the market price. It was a sitting duck. Whales began to push the price down, just enough to hit the first of these liquidation zones.

What followed was a domino effect—a liquidation cascade.

When the first group of leveraged traders was wiped out, their positions were automatically sold, adding massive selling pressure. This pushed the price down further, hitting the next liquidation zone, and then the next. It was a controlled demolition, designed to do one thing: clear out the ""dumb money"" and create a clean slate.



2. The Motive: A Pre-emptive Strike Before the Fed

So, why now? Look at the calendar. Next week, the U.S. Federal Reserve holds its FOMC meeting, where it will make a crucial decision on interest rates. This is one of the most significant market-moving events of the year.

Whales don't like uncertainty. The period before a Fed announcement is filled with nervous energy and unpredictable swings. By triggering this liquidation cascade \*before\* the meeting, they achieve three brilliant strategic goals:



\-  They De-Risk the Market: By flushing out the over-leveraged and panicky traders, they stabilize the market on their terms, reducing the chaos that could ensue after the Fed's announcement.



\-  They Engineer a Discount: This manufactured crash allows them to buy up huge amounts of Bitcoin at a bargain price. While everyone else was panic-selling, they were quietly accumulating, loading their bags for the next leg up.



\-  They Seize Control of the Narrative: A sharp drop creates fear. But for those who know what to look for, it signals opportunity. The whales have now set the stage to profit from the rebound they themselves will help create.



3. The Grand Finale: Get Ready for the Spike

This brings us to the most exciting part. This aggressive, strategic takedown isn't a sign of a bear market. It's the prelude to a powerful rally. Having cleared the board and filled their positions at a discount, the whales are now perfectly positioned for what comes next.

The consensus is growing that the Federal Reserve will signal a more ""dovish"" stance, opening the door for future interest rate cuts. Such a move would be rocket fuel for risk assets like Bitcoin.



With the over-leveraged players gone and the market reset, there's now very little resistance to the upside. The selling pressure has been artificially exhausted. The path of least resistance is now firmly upwards.

Don’t be fooled by the red candles and the fearful headlines. The game is played in the shadows, and the whales just showed their hand. They’ve cleared the path, taken their positions, and are ready for the next major move. This wasn't a crash. It was a launch sequence. Buckle up.

ETH’s narrative is bolstered by real world use cases and tight supply dynamics. ETF inflows recently hit a record $726 M in one day, with over $2.1B in inflows during the week

I believed in the project early on and I still like a few things about Cardano. But over time, I’ve averaged my position down to about $1.50, and I’m starting to question whether it’s worth holding onto anymore.

Back in the day, I saw all the confident predictions that ADA could hit $5–$7 easily, even when market cap logic didn’t quite add up. I got back into crypto around 2022 and have since been through every theory out there:
	•	Left-translated cycles, extended cycles, or… no cycle at all
	•	Institutions ruined everything
	•	Alt season is gone forever

Now I’m wondering if I should just take the loss, wait for the next bear market (whenever that comes), and reassess with fresh eyes, probably leaning more into BTC or other promising alts.

	•	Do you still think it could return to ATH?
	•	Should I wait a bit longer?

1m9z73p,Ethereum ETFs Now Hold 4.6% of Market Cap With Minimal Price Reaction,SuccessOdd382,69,19,2025-07-26 17:31:36,"I’ve been looking more closely at what’s going on with ETH ETFs and honestly, I don’t think the market is paying enough attention.

While most people are chasing meme rotations or just watching Bitcoin stay flat, ETH spot ETFs have now recorded 16 straight days of inflows. Just on Friday alone, they pulled in 453 million dollars. And that is not random. Someone is clearly building a position.

It’s not even evenly spread. BlackRock’s ETHA brought in 440 million dollars on its own that day. One fund. That’s not just a good day. That’s serious intent. ETHA now holds over 10.69 billion dollars. And that’s not some casual exposure either. its a major position.



After that Bitwise and Fidelity followed with inflows of around 10 million and 7 million while Grayscale’s ETHE is still bleeding though. It lost another 23 million on Friday. But even with that kind of outflow the overall flow across ETH ETFs stayed green. These says a lot. Quiet demand is still stronger than legacy outflows.

 it becomes clearer to me. Since launch ETH spot ETFs have now taken in 9.33 billion dollars in total inflows. Their combined assets under management are now sitting at 20.66 billion dollars which is already about 4.6% of ETH’s total market cap. just on Thursday over 1.5 billion dollars in value was traded across these ETFs. So it’s not just inflows, real volume is also picking up.

Here’s how I see it. It reminds me of how the BTC ETF flows started earlier this year. Just steady accumulation while everyone was distracted. ETH hasn’t had much hype lately or any new major narrative and aggressive push. And maybe that’s exactly why institutions are loading up now. The price is still reasonable with a consistent flow. but most retail traders aren’t even looking. it is still sitting quietly around 3700 dollars as if none of this is happening. But when i see flows like this building behind the scenes without price moving yet, it usually means one of two things. Either the interest fades away or the price catches up fast.

* Best in market privacy tech - privacy will matter with AI sifting thru metadata for chain analysis 
* Priced for dead at 1/8th Monero's market cap but better tech

* Sean Bowe is working on Tachyon - the last piece of private money Apollo project
* Bitcoin has lost its way - Saylor discourages self custody, BTC treasuries leveraging up, ETFs bringing 1 mil+ additional bitcoin under govt control.

* Coin emissions at 75% - the point where Bitcoin started going up

1mbo6q5,Ethereum Can outperform Bitcoin in next few months,northernBladee,5,8,2025-07-28 18:28:21,"Mike Novogratz dropped some bold predictions on CNBC  ETH outperforming BTC in the next 3-6 months and potentially hitting that $4,000 resistance multiple times. Then Galaxy Digital immediately sold 10,000 BTC, sending Bitcoin tumbling down

Novogratz isn't abandoning Bitcoin  he still predicts $150,000 and Galaxy holds 13,504 BTC. But they're clearly making a calculated rotation into Ethereum, now holding 64,858 ETH as their second-largest position.

 While Bitcoin companies issue convertible debt to fund their BTC purchases, Ethereum treasury companies are using equity financing instead. That's a fundamentally different risk profile no leverage, no debt obligations if things go sideways.

Companies like BitMine Immersion with 566,766 ETH and Sharplink Gaming with 360,807 ETH are betting big on this model. Ether Machine is even going public on NASDAQ with $1.5 billion committed to Ethereum.

The numbers back up the sentiment too. Ethereum ETFs pulled in $2.4 billion in six days during July while Bitcoin ETFs managed $827 million. BlackRock's ETHA is now managing over $10 billion, which suggests institutional appetite for ETH exposure is accelerating.

What I find compelling is the yield component. Bitcoin treasury companies basically just hold and hope for price appreciation. Ethereum treasury companies can stake, participate in DeFi, generate actual returns on their holdings while maintaining upside exposure. That's a different value proposition entirely.

They're positioning for a trend where corporate treasuries don't just store value  they actively generate yield.

1mbrx9v,btc dipped after getting shafted at $119k where's the momentum going?,hodorrny,0,12,2025-07-28 20:48:11,"so we just watched btc drop to $117.9k today with $47.5 million getting liquidated, and honestly this whole $119k rejection is getting concerning. we've seen this level turn into a brick wall multiple times now and each attempt is getting weaker.

here's what happened: btc ran from $115k to nearly $120k last week and a bunch of people fomo'd into longs right in that $118k-$119k zone. when price couldn't break higher, all those positions got nuked and created this cascade of selling pressure.

the liquidation data is pretty telling too. there's still a cluster of vulnerable longs sitting in the $118k range, so if we keep sliding we could see more pain. meanwhile, there's a massive wall of shorts between $120k-$120.6k that keeps capping any upside attempts.

what's really getting my attention though is how money is rotating away from btc. bitcoin dominance dropped almost 5% this month while eth gained 3%. eth etfs pulled in $1.8 billion this week compared to btc's measly $72 million. that's a pretty clear signal that institutional flow is shifting.

traders are also jumping into higher beta plays like sol, avax, and link because btc keeps chopping around these same levels. when the big dog can't break out, people start hunting for action elsewhere.

the technical picture is mixed though. some analysts are pointing to the mvrv ratio forming a double top pattern similar to 2021, which could mean we're getting close to a cycle peak. cryptoquant thinks we might see a reversal as early as late august if the pattern holds.

but here's the thing - we're still holding above key support and the broader structure looks intact. if btc can finally clear $119.5k with conviction, some analysts are targeting $135k in the coming weeks.

the fed meeting this week could be the catalyst we need. any dovish signals or hints about rate cuts could boost risk sentiment and give btc the push it needs to break this resistance. With those tax rates tools like awaken.tax become crucial to manage them.

right now it feels like we're at a crossroads. either btc finds the strength to blast through $119k and continue the rally, or we might see a more serious correction as momentum continues to fade.

anyone else getting frustrated watching this same rejection play out over and over? feels like we're stuck in groundhog day at this level.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mbrx9v/btc_dipped_after_getting_shafted_at_119k_wheres/,0,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX",positive

1mdhcve,"fed holds rates as expected but crypto markets already pricing in the boring outcome, here's what happens next",dumble_hold_the_door,63,13,2025-07-30 20:21:13,"so the fomc meeting wrapped up with exactly what everyone expected rates staying at current levels. no surprise cuts, no hawkish surprises, just powell doing his usual ""we're data dependent"" routine. but the crypto reaction (or lack thereof) tells us way more about where we're headed.

the pre-meeting selloff was the real story

btc dropped from $119k to $117k leading into today's meeting as traders de-risked. crypto traders turned cautious ahead of the fomc meeting, with data signaling bitcoin price could fall into correction. classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" setup that we've seen dozens of times.

why the non-event is actually bullish

when the fed keeps rates steady in a strong growth environment, it's the best possible scenario for risk assets. no rate hike to kill liquidity, no emergency cut signaling recession fears. just steady monetary policy while the economy keeps chugging along.

here's what this means for crypto going forward:

institutional flows continue unchanged rate stability means the etf inflows keep coming. pension funds and institutional allocators aren't getting spooked by monetary policy shifts. the corporate treasury adoption trend stays intact.

dollar strength moderates no rate changes means usd doesn't get a boost from higher yields. this removes one major headwind that's been capping crypto rallies. weaker dollar = higher btc prices historically.

risk appetite returns gradually many altcoins have enjoyed some breakouts immediately after the news, as traders begin to feel more comfortable making speculative buys again now that this month's decision is behind them. the uncertainty is gone for now.

what i'm watching in the next 48 hours:

whether btc can reclaim $119k resistance now that fed uncertainty is cleared

altcoin strength as traders rotate back into higher beta plays

any dovish language from powell's press conference about future cuts

etf flows tomorrow institutional money tends to come back after fomc meetings

the bigger picture hasn't changed

fed holding steady just removes a potential volatility catalyst. the fundamental crypto story, institutional adoption, supply scarcity, corporate treasuries all of it remains intact. we're probably back to focusing on technicals and crypto-specific catalysts.

honestly this was the most boring possible outcome, which is exactly what crypto needed. no macro shocks to derail the institutional adoption narrative. now we can get back to the business of grinding higher based on actual crypto fundamentals instead of fed tea leaf reading.

expecting some relief bounce over the next few days as the de-risking trade reverses. nothing dramatic, just a return to the slow grind higher that was happening before everyone got spooked about the meeting. Time to fire up [awaken.tax](http://awaken.tax) and start tracking these swing trades properly as volatility picks back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mdhcve/fed_holds_rates_as_expected_but_crypto_markets/,63,1,1,BTC,positive

1mgoaov,What if Bitcoin stay at 120k and Altseason kick in ?,hduynam99,22,62,2025-08-03 16:58:22,"I’m expecting Ethereum to hit around $10k (give or take) by some time in the future. One way to know ETH’s strength is through the ETH/BTC ratio, because Bitcoin is basically the standard in crypto. It's like the measuring stick for the whole market.

When the ETH/BTC ratio goes up, it means the market is favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. When it goes down, Bitcoin’s leading the way. Historically, this ratio has bounced between 0.018 and 0.09. So when ETH is strong, 1 ETH can be worth as much as 0.09 BTC. When it's weak, it's closer to 0.018 BTC.

I believe history tends to repeat itself, the details might change, but the ratio usually plays out the same.

So let’s say Bitcoin hits $120,000 by year end, and we get another altcoin season like we saw in 2017 and 2021, pushing ETH/BTC ratio climbs to 0.09 again, that would put Ethereum at:

0.09 x $120,000 = $10,800.

Look up ETH/BTC !

1mi33qi,A Sad Crypto Story,wadleo,164,101,2025-08-05 07:56:00,"Back in 2011, a programmer named Stefan Thomas made a short animated video called “What is Bitcoin?” just a simple explainer to help people understand this strange new digital currency. For his work, he was paid 7,002 bitcoins. At the time, that wasn't a big deal. Bitcoin was worth just a few dollars, and no one really knew what it would become.

Stefan, who believed in the technology, stored the coins on a secure USB drive called an IronKey. It was built for maximum security so secure, in fact, that if you forget the password, you only get ten chances to guess it before it locks forever. Stefan wrote the password down on a slip of paper, then misplaced it.

Fast forward a decade, and Bitcoin has exploded in value. Those 7,002 coins are now worth over $800 million. But Stefan can’t get to them. He’s used eight out of his ten tries, and every wrong guess brings him closer to losing it all permanently.

He’s talked to security experts, cryptographers, even companies that specialize in data recovery. They all told him the same thing: there’s no way in. The encryption on the IronKey is practically impossible to crack. No reset button. No backup. No customer support to call.

Stefan has spoken publicly about how he’s tried to make peace with the situation. He doesn’t dwell on it anymore, because what else can he do? It’s not about being careless or greedy. It’s just a painful reminder of how easy it is to lose something incredibly valuable,not because you lost the thing itself, but because you forgot the key to it.

His story has become legendary in the crypto world,a quiet warning about the risks of self-custody in a digital age. When your wealth is protected by a password, forgetting it can cost you everything.

In 2023, security researchers at Unciphered claimed they found a way to bypass the IronKey's 10-attempt limit using advanced hardware techniques. They offered to help, but Thomas declined, saying he had already made deals with other recovery teams. The Bitcoin remains locked.

His holdings are currently valued at over $820 million.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mi33qi/a_sad_crypto_story/,164,1,1,BTC,neutral
1mi4r91,These Are the Only Crypto Levels That Matter Right Now (How to Avoid August’s Trap Setups This Week),Series7Trader,7,5,2025-08-05 09:42:32,"If you read the last breakdown on why August trading gets weird, you already know the drill:

* Low liquidity
* No macro signals
* Chop with no follow-through
* Retail gets baited early, loses edge

Sunday and Monday flashed some price bumps-which triggered FOMO for frothed up retail traders. But, as we discussed -those were bad moves to make.

So how do you actually beat the August traps this-and probably next week?

# Playbook:

No long trades this week or next unless these macro-confirmation levels start to trigger:

* BTC/USDT must break above $120K to prove strength
* USDT.D needs to fall below 4.34%-stablecoin exit = risk-on
* TOTAL3 must clear $1.115T to validate altcoin participation
* BTC/USDT below $116K = invalidation zone (and it's there now)
* ETH/BTC above 0.0329 signals alt rotation, especially ETH-led

Traders keep reacting to surface level moves: green candles, volume spikes, sudden pumps. But in August? That’s the trap. No volume + no macro =no trend.

Only price levels tied to dominance flows, total market cap shifts, and BTC compression breakouts offer real edge.

Want to survive August and more than likely come out booking a positive month? Don’t guess. Let confirmation come to you. These five levels are your filter. No triggers=no long trades.

Also, a few people were saying *""the trend won't apply anymore, no more alt seasons""* but did people say that in both 2016 and 2020 too? Or is this a new sentiment?

1. First Cycle:

→ Bitcoin halving: November 28, 2012

→ Altseason peak: December 2013

→ Time between: \~13 months

2. Second Cycle:

→ Bitcoin halving: July 9, 2016

*""If this trend continues, then following the April 19, 2024 halving, the next altseason peak could likely occur October 2025.""*

1mk53ol,When Markets Start Moving Without You,SuccessOdd382,6,10,2025-08-07 16:42:13,"The way markets are moving today makes me think. Bitcoin, altcoins, and stocks have been climbing again, and now even China’s A-shares are starting to flip into a proper bull mood. Everything seems to be rising at once. not just the prices, but everything around.  
  
I can remember, not long ago people were still second-guessing everything. The whole mood was stuck in “wait and see.” While a lot of folks probably stayed on the sidelines or cut risk thinking more downside was still coming. And now it’s like the momentum just picked up without giving anyone a clean signal.  
  
This is usually how it goes though. The market rarely makes a big announcement before moving. Things just start shifting, slow at first, then all at once, and by the time people start noticing, most of the early part of the move is already in. And that is what makes it hard. Not just the timing but the patience. The ability to stay exposed even when it feels like nothing is happening, or worse, when it feels like everything might fall apart. Situations like this always bring things like DCA into people’s minds. Not because it’s smart or strategic or any of that, but because it lets them stay in motion without having to solve the whole market puzzle every time. No need to know if it’s the bottom or not. Just bit by bit, and let the averages do their thing over time. It’s not exciting but it keeps you from getting stuck in that cycle of trying to catch the perfect moment and always missing it.  
  
And then when things finally move, like now, you’re already there. You’re not chasing, you are part of it. It’s wild how often the big days come when people are least ready for them. But I guess that is the point.

1mk7cth,trump to open the door for crypto in 401(k)s...the realistic analysis,hodorrny,55,29,2025-08-07 18:06:01,"so there’s talk about trump planning to sign an executive order to open 401(k)s to crypto, real estate, and private equity although as of now, it’s not signed.

why is this important? it means a large new source of capital from regular americans, who mostly had only stocks and bonds before. institutional players and fund managers now have a green light to include crypto options, probably starting with regulated bitcoin and ethereum ETFs. this kind of demand coming from millions of retirement accounts could change liquidity and trading activity significantly.

all the hype around billions in retirement cash flowing into crypto remains only a possibility, not confirmed. regulators haven’t started making rules, and no changes have been made yet.

this means while it’s interesting to consider that $12 trillion+ might eventually move into crypto, it’s important to keep expectations realistic. the market will continue reacting to news and rumors, but nothing is certain.

for traders, this means there could be higher price swings when updates come or if the order is signed and agencies begin taking action. but until then, it’s mainly speculation and waiting.

if this 401(k) crypto integration does happen, millions of americans will suddenly need proper tax reporting for their retirement crypto holdings. platforms like awaken.tax, which specialize in handling complex crypto transactions including DeFi and NFT trades, could see increased demand as retirement account holders navigate the tax implications of crypto investments alongside their traditional portfolios. the current crypto tax landscape is already complex for individual traders—adding retirement account considerations will create new challenges.

so if you’re following developments, stay updated but do not expect immediate effects. real changes depend on the order being signed, regulatory specifics, and how employers implement it.

Note: I repeat trump has not signed the 401(k) crypto order yet. the current market attention is based on potential outcomes, not confirmed events. monitor the situation, but don’t expect retirement funds to start moving into crypto soon. patience is necessary here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mk7cth/trump_to_open_the_door_for_crypto_in_401ksthe/,55,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

Bought TRX, XRP, and a bunch of random altcoins. Lost $2,700 in a few months. Then I tried margin trading (big mistake), got liquidated, and was left staring at an empty account. Honestly, I almost quit.

In 2019, I decided to stop gambling and start learning. I studied charts, watched real traders, read books, and backtested strategies. I didn’t trade real money for a while—just practiced and journaled everything.

By 2020, I was finally making small profits. Took only setups I trusted, avoided hype, and managed risk properly. Made around $4,800 on a $3K account. Nothing crazy, but it felt earned.

2021 bull run? I was ready. I grew my account to over $43K trading ETH, SOL, and a few strong alts. But I got cocky, messed with leverage again, and gave back a chunk. That lesson hurt, but it stuck.

2022 was survival mode. I traded less, avoided trying to “buy the dip,” and focused on capital preservation. Profits were small, but I didn’t lose.

From 2023 to now, I’ve kept it boring: 1% risk per trade, only 2–3 reliable setups, and strict journaling. I don’t trade every day. I don’t chase pumps. I just stick to what works.

In 2024, I crossed $100K in my trading account. No moonshots. Just consistency over time.

TL;DR

Lost money in 2018 (like most beginners) Started learning & tracking everything in 2019 Profitable by 2020, stayed consistent Bull run helped, but greed punished me in 2021 Focused on capital protection in 2022 2023–2025: steady growth, no drama Finally passed $100K in 2024 Biggest Lessons:

You won’t get rich overnight. Risk management > everything. You don’t need to trade every day. Journaling your trades = free edge. Survive long enough, and your edge will show up.

Bitcoin holding strong above $150K, stability is a green light for alt growth.

1mn64ug,Long-term diamond hands only: Your Top 3 Altcoins for the Next 5+ Years,keghar,77,200,2025-08-11 07:02:18,"Alright fam, let’s play a little thought experiment.
Imagine you’re locked in for the next 5+ years. No flipping, no panic selling, no chasing the next hype coin. You pick three altcoins… and that’s it. Through bull runs, bear markets, and all the sideways boredom in between – you hold.

Which three make the cut for you? And more importantly – why?

Here’s my forever bag (at least for now):

1. ONDO
Yeah, I know it’s not everyone’s first thought, but hear me out. ONDO is carving out a spot in real-world asset tokenization – basically bringing traditional finance products into the crypto world in a tokenized form. If this sector blows up (and I think it will), ONDO could be right there at the front. It’s early, it’s risky, but I like the upside.

2. Chainlink (LINK)
LINK is that quiet but critical infrastructure project. Without oracles, DeFi as we know it just wouldn’t work. And LINK isn’t just sitting still – CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) could be massive for connecting different blockchains. In my eyes, LINK is like the plumbing of Web3. Not flashy, but essential.

3. Ethereum (ETH)
The OG smart contract platform. ETH is still where most of the action happens – DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, you name it. With upgrades like the Merge behind us and more scalability improvements coming, I think ETH will keep its top spot for years. Sure, competitors will pop up, but ETH has that network effect and developer community that’s hard to beat.

⸻

Now, I’m not saying these three are perfect. Anything can happen in crypto. But when I think long-term, I like having a mix of:
	•	Adoption potential (ONDO)
	•	Critical infrastructure (LINK)
	•	Proven backbone (ETH)

What about you? Do you go safe with blue chips like ETH, BNB, ADA? Or are you throwing darts at the next potential 100x microcap? Maybe a mix – one safe bet, two moonshots?

I’d love to hear your reasoning. Even if you think my picks are trash, tell me what you’d replace them with and why. Bonus points if you’ve actually survived holding through a full bear market before – those war stories are always fun to read.

1mnw5pl,Eth vs Btc: What is the reality?,dumble_hold_the_door,28,40,2025-08-12 02:00:43,"So eth just hit its highest weekly close since 2021 at 4,300. The ETH/BTC ratio doubled from its April low, and suddenly everyone's asking if Bitcoin is losing market share. but whats the reality?

i caught two takes today that got me thinking:

first, Samson Mow argues the recent eth rally is fueled by bitcoin holders rotating capital into eth for short-term gain...only to dump it once prices get high enough and shift profits back into btc. he calls this the “bagholder’s dilemma.” current eth/btc ratio is around 0.036, double its april low, but he warns eth faces a sell-off once it hits key psychological levels

Secomd, Willy Woo called Bitcoin the ""perfect asset for the next 1000 years"" - and looking at longer timeframes, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Bitcoin's market cap is still only 11% of gold's $23 trillion, meaning we're far from complete adoption.

The real question isn't whether ETH can pump another 12% to hit its ATH. It's whether Bitcoin continues building toward becoming a world reserve asset. And for that to happen, we need way more capital flowing in.

in short term flows, eth sees spikes from traders chasing yield, but profits often rotate back to btc

in long tem confidrence, btc remains the default store of value

in short, btc isn’t losing its dominance, capital flow dynamics shift over cycles, but fundamentals still favor bitcoin for many institutions. eth can rally within those windows, but its staying power depends on sustained narratives, not just hype. either way, if you're actively trading between eth and btc or taking profits on these moves, platforms like awaken.tax become pretty essential for tracking cost basis across all the swaps and rotations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mnw5pl/eth_vs_btc_what_is_the_reality/,28,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

1mo7mt5,Why I will never stop using Ledger as my crypto wallet,DepartmentMaster3556,168,7,2025-08-12 12:40:46,"Over the years I have gone through the whole cycle when it comes to wallets. I started with browser extensions because they were quick and easy to set up. Then I moved on to a few mobile apps for convenience when traveling. At one point I even kept a portion of my stack on an exchange wallet which was a big mistake. Thankfully nothing happened but it taught me a valuable lesson about control and security.Each type had its own benefits. Hot wallets were great for quick trades and interacting with DeFi. Mobile wallets made payments on the go super simple. Browser extensions worked well for dapps. At the same time every single one of those options came with that nagging feeling that if something went wrong such as phishing, malware, or an exchange hack my keys could be compromised instantly.

Last January I decided to take a more serious look at cold storage. I had heard about [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/what-is-a-crypto-wallet) for years but never really spent the time to understand how it worked. After exploring their site the way they explained their ecosystem really clicked for me. Hardware wallets built with Secure Element chips, a custom operating system, and transaction signing that never exposes private keys to the internet. It was the first time I truly felt like I had complete self custody without sacrificing too much convenience in day to day use.

I have seen Ledger mentioned a lot more over the past year and so far my experience has been very positive. Updates have been smooth and I have had no issues. The peace of mind alone makes it worth it for me.

1mp31bn,"Without Chainlink, Crypto Collapses – Why LINK might Be the Most important asset in the entire space",keghar,51,44,2025-08-13 12:26:29,"Most people see Chainlink (LINK) as “just an oracle project.” In my opinion, that’s like calling the internet “just some computers connected together.” Technically true, but missing the entire point.

I believe Chainlink is the invisible infrastructure that keeps the entire crypto universe running – and without it, things would grind to a halt faster than most realize.

**1. Blockchains are blind without reliable external data**  
Blockchains are fantastic at executing code. They can enforce agreements with mathematical certainty… but only with the data they already have. They can’t natively know the price of ETH in USD, whether it’s raining in New York, or if a stock market closed higher today.

Chainlink solves this with secure, decentralized data feeds. That’s not just a convenience – it’s critical. Without trustworthy data, smart contracts would be stuck in a vacuum.

**2. Billions of dollars already depend on Chainlink every day**  
Look at DeFi. Platforms like Aave, Synthetix, GMX, and countless others rely on Chainlink’s price feeds to determine collateral values, execute trades, or trigger liquidations.

If one data feed failed or was manipulated, it could cause cascading failures worth billions. LINK’s oracle network is one of the main reasons that hasn’t happened.

**3. It’s not just DeFi – it’s everything**  
Chainlink is moving beyond finance. It provides weather data for blockchain-based insurance. It enables real-world asset tokenization by linking traditional markets to blockchains.

And with CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), it’s bridging entire blockchains together. Imagine Bitcoin and Ethereum talking to each other seamlessly, or a private bank network interacting with public chains – that’s what CCIP is aiming to deliver.

**4. The partnerships are on another level**  
Google, SWIFT, AWS, DTCC, ANZ Bank… the list goes on. These aren’t speculative “maybe one day” partnerships – they’re actual integrations, pilots, and testnets. Chainlink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3.

**5. It’s the “plumbing” of crypto – and plumbing isn’t sexy**  
The average person doesn’t think about DNS when they type a website address. They just expect it to work. In the same way, most people in crypto don’t think about where their price data comes from – but without Chainlink, their favorite DeFi app wouldn’t function.

That’s why LINK often flies under the radar: it’s critical, but invisible.

**So… is LINK the most important crypto asset?**  
I think Bitcoin is irreplaceable as a store of value. Ethereum is unmatched as a general-purpose platform. But without Chainlink, both lose a significant part of their functionality.

For me, LINK is like electricity. Not as flashy as the devices it powers, but without it, nothing else works.

It was pure mental weakness + greed. After selling, I kept trying to time the market — buying and selling multiple times — and ended up with ~40% less ETH than I had originally.

what's driving this? the institutional money keeps pouring in—blackrock's eth etf alone hit $10 billion. we've got the strategic bitcoin reserve thing happening in washington. the regulatory clarity act is moving through congress. supply shock from the halving. corporate treasuries adding btc.

somewhere between $130k-$160k feels realistic if current momentum holds. the $200k+ calls need everything to go perfect, but honestly? after watching bitcoin hit $124k when most people thought $100k was ambitious, maybe ""impossible"" targets aren't so impossible anymore.

Right now, Bitcoin is over 50% of my crypto portfolio. Not because I expect crazy gains, but because I see it as the safest store of value in crypto. It’s the one asset I’m confident will survive every bear market.

When I want growth, I look to altcoins like ONDO, LINK and HBAR. That’s where I see bigger upside potential, even if the risk is much higher. But without Bitcoin as the base of my portfolio, I’d feel way less secure.

For me, BTC is less about getting rich fast and more about staying in the game long term.

Say what you want, but Bitcoin Cash has survived multiple cycles, forks, FUD, and still hasn’t gone anywhere. That alone says something.  
  
For context:  
 → It peaked close to $4,000+ during the 2017 bull.  
 → It's still supported on most major platforms.  
 → It *works* as peer-to-peer digital cash.  
 → Devs are still building and there's legit community support (albeit quieter than BTC or ETH).  
  
I’m not expecting an overnight moonshot, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we slowly grind back toward pre-fork levels in a full-blown bull say $3K–$5K over the next 12–18 months. Especially with BTC dominance pulling back, capital rotation into older alts is inevitable.  
  
To position for that, I’ve been slowly adding to my BCH stack and continue to do so. neхo actually has a promo right now where you get 3% back if you increase your BCH balance and hold it just a nice bonus while I accumulate through August. If you’re already bullish, it kind of makes sense.

1mq95qq,"Held BTC for years, sold too early — Need your help",IndependentRoyal1908,0,35,2025-08-14 18:37:56,"I held BTC for years. Then I read that it’s not smart to just hold forever, but that you should take profits. After years of holding, I told myself that this cycle I wouldn’t be stupid and that after 5 years of holding, I would finally take some profits. That was the phase when BTC almost broke 100,000 USD. At 96,000 USD I sold part of my holdings, then I thought we would enter a bear market like in previous cycles. The price dropped to 86,000 USD and I sold another part. Then it fell to around 75,000 USD and I waited for it to go further down to 50,000–60,000 USD. But that never happened.

Instead, it went from 75,000 USD back up to 85,000 USD, then to 95,000 USD, then it broke 100,000 USD again and I thought: “Okay, no panic, it will go back down, the market is overbought.” And then it went from 100,000 USD to 110,000 USD and now even over 120,000 USD. And I could cry, because I will probably never again hold as much BTC as I did before.

Now I’m really mad at myself, because if I had just held, I’d be massively in profit right now.

After selling, I kept trying to study the market, but I’m so confused because the current cycle doesn’t match the previous ones. And now I’m 50 % down.

I’m glad I didn’t sell everything, but that 50 % loss is huge for me.

I regret listening to others and will probably just hold from now on. I also read articles claiming you get the biggest profits if you sell after the halving, which has also proven wrong.

My question now is how I should act. I don’t want to make another mistake. I also won’t follow your advice literally, because I’m already heavily in the red from this mistake, but my hope is still that the price will eventually crash and correct down to around 60,000 USD. My question is: how realistic do you think that scenario is? I’d even be happy if the price corrected to somewhere around 85,000 USD, because then I could make up my 50 % loss. So my question is: how likely do you think that is, and what do you think the price will do? Should I panic buy now, which would mean I’d never get back to my previous BTC holdings, or should I just wait because there’s still a chance the price might eventually drop to 50,000 USD or 60,000 USD or 70,000 USD or 80,000 USD?

Bitcoin:

\-Support: 117k (yes, that’s a big support level)

\-Hourly chart could morph into a bear flag, so bulls need to watch their back.

\-A note from our analyst: “Falls like yesterday trigger a buy reaction — the more violent the drop, the less risk attached to it.”

Ethereum:

\-Previous ATH from 2021? 4,850.

\-Current congestion zone 4,550–4,750 likely absorbed most selling pressure.

\-Plan: Buy a breakout above 4,800 (with a tight stop). Weak shorts there could be forced to cover in panic.

Big Picture:

BTC is flirting with a short-term floor while ETH is coiling right under a major breakout level. If ETH clears 4,800, there’s little in the way until blue sky territory — and if BTC clears 120k with conviction, we might see a rush of sidelined money pile in.

Why those picks specifically (e.g., utility, team, community, metrics like DAAs, profitability)?
Also, keeping in mind the classic rotation thesis (money flows down the risk curve: BTC first, then ETH and large caps (we are seeing this already in full force), mids, and finally small caps/memes/degen plays), what would you buy now to position yourself for this and/or what would you rotate into over the next few months when alts start pumping?

1mrje3r,BTC and ETH ETFs just had their biggest week ever and it's getting spicy between these two,hodorrny,31,3,2025-08-16 03:26:07,"So apparently Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs just posted a combined $40B in volume this week. That's their strongest performance yet, and honestly the competition between these two is getting pretty interesting.

The fascinating part is how ETH seems to be following BTC's playbook from early 2024. Remember when Bitcoin ETFs launched in January and everyone was skeptical, then it just kept climbing? ETH ETFs had the same lukewarm reception when they launched in July 2024, but now they're pulling massive numbers  $1.01B in net inflows just on Monday alone.

What's really got my attention is that ETH supply on exchanges just dropped to 12% while this is happening. So you've got decreasing supply, massive ETF inflows, and BTC setting the pace upward.
Some analysts think ETH's new ATH is still weeks or months away, but honestly with how these ETFs are performing and the way they're pushing each other higher, I'm not so sure about that timeline.
With all this ETF volume and the constant rebalancing happening, tracking everything for taxes is becoming a real headache. Been using awaken.tax to keep all the ETF flows and crypto movements organized since this stuff gets messy fast.

Some pointers from me:

Bitcoin only has limited coins. Unlike dollars, Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, so it could gain value over time.

Prices move a lot in crypto. Most people who try to time the market end up buying high and selling low. Holding avoids a lot of those mistakes.

The fomo also kicks in when you sell and the value start climbing up, a psychological panic creeps in and people end up buying on a high. 

Nonetheless, Imo we don't have to pick any strategy as a hard and fast rule. In many cases, just taking the profit and moving on makes perfect sense and that can many real life cases. 
It's really all about how much risk you're okay with, when you need the money considering how much you have invested. What do you think, what is your preference?

It’s Unitronix (UTRX), and a lot of the recent buzz is tied to their new plan for hitting a $1 price. The company laid out a clear checklist of things they need to do, which I honestly find refreshing. They’re tying their success to real, public milestones.  

First up is their treasury. They’ve already announced holdings of 5.5 Bitcoin and now a policy to add Ethereum. The next step is for them to actually show that they’re getting more mined Bitcoin from their partnership. They also plan to start tokenizing real-world assets and are looking to generate some yield from DeFi.  If they keep releasing clean dashboards on their progress and those key performance indicators keep trending up, it could be a major catalyst. With a really tight float, any good news could move the needle a lot. The best part is that their leadership is incentivized to hit these goals, which is a big plus in my book. 

The whole approach feels more grounded in execution than just pure hype. Instead of hearing big promises, we're seeing them outline specific, measurable steps. It really puts the power back in the hands of us, the investors, to follow along and see if they can deliver. It makes me wonder what other kinds of partnerships or tech they could be working on behind the scenes that haven’t been announced yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mtq2u4/a_new_playbook_for_a_microcap_with_a_big_goal/,8,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive
1mtvcre,What drives crypto price?,Designer-Ball-5383,0,5,2025-08-18 19:08:18,"Cryptos price is community driven

Some communities have formed around utilities (the belief that this coin will somehow be useful in the future) but that success isn’t a 1:1 price driver, and most VC utility coins are riddled with insiders and the launch is everything but fair distributed

Well now then what is bitcoin? Bitcoin has no utility it has an idea behind it. So what it is? It’s a pure belief asset (PBA) in which a community of people fell in love with its inspiring narrative (which the og bag workers of bitcoin built out) The goal: To disrupt traditional finance, first appearing post 2008 financial crisis as a peer to peer transactional intermediary meant to cut out Wall Street

The only reason it holds value is due to fact that people believe it does and this all steams from the underlying community. Without og delusional bag workers its doesn’t exist today. You can pretend that it was simply the tech behind it and that it was inevitable but without the OG delusion bulls who built out that narrative that you think you now understand it’s doesn’t exist

So when bidding coins you want to look for organic fairly distributed projects that’s are community based. If you must bid utilities coins look for those that have good enough tech and narrative for a legitimate community to form ($ETH)

If youve read this far I beg you to check out #SPX6900 like just look into it

This is the next iteration of a pure belief asset with a similar narrative of rebellion to Bitcoin

In a time when more and more average Americans are getting priced out of their local restaurants people are going to look towards alternative investments/ revolution 

Many people are slowly subscribing to the idea that the system is broken so let’s tear it down, Seen with the growing popularity of socialist U.S representatives across the country

The answer isn’t pro socialist policy it’s getting involved into the pure side of capitalism: activism

1mufr0h,Altcoin Season Signals Strengthening,Straight-Attitude488,1,0,2025-08-19 11:28:37,"Hey everyone,

Markets have been really interesting this week. Bitcoin’s still doing its up and down dance, but if you zoom out, the bull cycle structure is still intact. What caught my attention though is **Ethereum dominance creeping higher** that’s usually a strong early sign that an altcoin season might actually be on the horizon.

What really surprised me was the regulatory news. The **Fed and SEC have basically ended their “special” crypto supervision programs.** That means crypto activity will now just fall under the *same supervision banks already deal with*. To me, that feels like a huge step regulators are finally treating crypto as “normal finance,” not some weird speculative corner of the market.

On the altcoin side, I’ve been digging into the **RWA (real world asset) sector.** A lot of projects there are still just hype with no real use case, but a few are actually trying to tie crypto utility to tangible assets. One that stood out to me is **$REM**, which is building around real estate (probably the most conservative asset class out there). Instead of just “tokenizing hype,” they’re trying to link utility to something institutions already trust.

For me, the big signals right now are:

* ETH dominance rising → alt season vibes.
* BTC still in a bull structure, but we need to stay cautious near the highs.
* RWAs could actually become the “serious” narrative this run, especially if utility-backed tokens like $REM get traction.

Curious what you all think:  
👉 Do you see RWAs becoming a legit sector in this bull market?  
👉 Or will the money still flow into the usual memes and high risk DeFi plays once alt season kicks in?

instead of holding everything, i trimmed about 40% of my alt positions, rotated a good portion into bitcoin, and parked roughly 25% in usdc. it wasn’t about bragging or timing the top, more about not letting one bad candle erase months of work. i’ve seen too many people ride profits back down to zero.

my question for people here who’ve been through this: how do you approach a run like this? do you set hard cash-out percentages, like pulling 20% at certain milestones, or do you rebalance into safer assets as the market shifts? my biggest fear right now is giving back profit rather than missing new upside.

curious what frameworks or rules you use once you’ve had a big green run. do you start taking money out into fiat, or just keep compounding inside crypto? i want to build consistency, not just have a lucky streak.

I was recently blessed with a $10k bonus and I’d like to invest it in Bitcoin. I’ve been into crypto for years, but at some point I stopped following the news and just kept holding my bag—no sales, no new purchases.

Based on my analysis of Bitcoin’s halving cycles, the best approach might be to invest $1–2k every month over the next 5–10 months. Putting it all in right now could be risky if we see a strong 20–30% correction, while stretching it out too long, for example, $500 per month for 20 months, would mean I’d still be buying at the start of the next bear market.

for some background information i have been in Crypto since November 2024, mostly investing in bitcoin, solana, and some CTO meme coins and have been fairly successful so far all considered I hopped in mid bull run.

i have been trading perps since about april on only major pairs such as BTC, ETH, SOL, TAO. i invested 500usd to trade perps as this seemed way less risky than meme coin trenching. 

couple months go by i run the account up 50%, then i proceed to lose it all, i only ever used 10-20x leverage on obvious plays like range highs-lows with loose SL. this was about may.

once i blew my account i decided to take a step back and re evaluate my strategy and watch the markets from the sidelines. fast forward to August, i decide im ready to take my new mentality back into the markets. this time i challenge myself to turn 100usd back into that 500 or so that i lost initially. 

within 2 weeks i ran that $100 account back into the $700 range, i was over the moon. i wanted to prove to myself that i wasn’t a complete degen and that i could be a competent trader and i had done it.

up until 2 days ago, everything was going great, i finally had enough capital to walk away from a trade with a 5-10% pnl and be happy, but this wasn’t good enough. i over-leveraged myself on a bad position and went under water almost immediately, what goes up must come down. all day at work i was watching my position, waiting for it to come down just enough to close without ruining my account… that never happened.

went to bed that night with a super tight TP right about my entry, the market swung within .5% from my entry but did not close position, the market then completely reversed and my entire position was liquidated. 

750usd gone, i am a young fella from canada and work a minimum wage job, yeah it hurts. don’t mess with leverage. i dont even know what to do with myself right now, im at a loss for words and feel like a complete and utter failure i really needed that money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mvmlnq/futures_has_broken_my_soul/,37,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",positive

Lower rates means cheaper capital. Institutions sitting on trillions will hunt for returns, and Bitcoin is the *hardest asset in the room*.

* **Narrative tailwind.** “Digital gold” shines brightest when the Fed admits it has to print again. Especially with these ETFs in the picture. This could lead to Eth's next leg up and maybe eventually the alt season that every influencer has been calling for.

1mw7bwo,"BTC whale dumped their bitcoin bags for ethereum positions..$76M sold, 68k eth bought. Why?",hodorrny,245,123,2025-08-21 10:38:17,"just saw some wild whale activity that has me thinking about what's really driving these moves from btc to eth.

the latest whale move:

a bitcoin og who held for 7 years just sold 670 btc ($76 million) to go long on ethereum. this whale had been sitting on approx 14k btc worth over $1.6 billion since buying from binance and htx way back in the day.
instead of just holding cash, they immediately opened 4 long positions totaling approx 68k eth - most of it on 10x leverage around the $4,300 mark.
this isn't isolated:

bitmine immersion just added another approx 52k eth to their treasury, bringing total holdings to 1.52 million tokens worth $6.6 billion
institutional wallets were buying up approx 9k eth each ($38 million) during recent dips
other satoshi-era whales have been moving massive amounts of btc after years of dormancy

why the shift is happening:
timing matters: this happened right after btc hit its new ath of $124k and eth almost reclaimed its 2021 high of $4,878. smart money often rotates between assets at these levels.

leverage opportunities: you can't really leverage btc the same way institutional players can leverage eth. these whales are opening massive leveraged positions because they see more upside potential in eth.

institutional infrastructure: ethereum has better institutional tools now. defi protocols, staking yields, and corporate treasury strategies all favor eth over btc for active management.

market maturity: crypto analysts say og bitcoiners selling is actually healthy - it shows new buyers entering and markets maturing. the money isn't leaving crypto, it's rotating.

risk vs reward calculation: when you've made 1000x+ gains on btc, taking some profits to bet on eth's next move up makes sense. especially when eth has more room to grow percentage-wise.

the reality check:
not all these moves worked out immediately. the whale's eth positions went underwater after opening, dropping to $4,080 and putting three positions close to liquidation around $3,700.

but that's the point - whales are willing to take these risks because they see eth as having more upside potential than btc at current levels.

what this means:

we're seeing a rotation from ""store of value"" btc plays into ""growth asset"" eth plays. whales who made their fortunes in btc are now betting that eth will be the next big mover.
this isn't about btc being bad - it's about opportunity cost. when you're sitting on billions in gains, diversifying into the asset with better risk/reward makes sense.
anyone else noticing this pattern of btc profits rotating into eth? feels like we're in the middle of a major capital rotation.

1mwlag0,central banks trapped by government debt - here's why crypto might be the winner,dumble_hold_the_door,6,1,2025-08-21 19:51:06,"financial times just dropped a report that central banks are getting squeezed to keep interest rates artificially low because governments borrowed way too much money. this could be huge for crypto trading.

what's happening:

governments around the world went on a borrowing spree and now they need cheap money to service all that debt. central banks are basically stuck - raise rates and governments can't pay their bills, keep them low and inflation stays hot.

this puts us in what economists call ""fiscal dominance""  where debt levels control monetary policy instead of economic fundamentals.

why this matters for crypto:

money has to go somewhere

when bonds pay nothing and savings accounts are a joke, people look for better returns. crypto becomes way more attractive when the ""safe"" alternatives barely keep up with inflation.

we're already seeing this play out. every time the fed hints at keeping rates low, crypto markets pump because traders know more liquidity is coming.

dollar gets weaker

low rates typically weaken the dollar over time. when the dollar loses value, bitcoin and eth look better as alternatives. not just for trading but as actual stores of value.

extended bull market potential

if central banks really are trapped into keeping rates low for years, crypto could see an extended rally. cheap borrowing costs mean more leverage, more institutional buying, and more retail fomo.

the volatility factor

here's the catch - crypto becomes even more sensitive to any hint of rate changes. if markets believe the fed will stay dovish, we moon. but if they even whisper about tightening, leveraged positions get liquidated fast.

what to watch:

fed meetings become even more important for crypto prices

any talk of ""yield curve control"" or ""financial stability"" means they're prioritizing debt costs over inflation

government debt-to-gdp ratios - the higher they go, the more trapped central banks become

my take:

this creates a perfect storm for crypto. traditional finance is getting squeezed from all sides while bitcoin and ethereum offer an escape route from the whole system.

sure, volatility will be insane. but when central banks admit they can't raise rates without breaking something, that's basically advertising bitcoin as digital gold. just remember if you're making moves based on this macro setup, keep track of everything for tax purposes. platforms like awaken.tax make it easier to stay compliant while you capitalize on these opportunities.

the fed might not admit they're trapped, but the market knows. and crypto traders are positioning accordingly.

1mwvq4i,Even the Fed now admits it: banks risk extinction if they ignore crypto,VibinNoodle,48,17,2025-08-22 03:23:43,"For years, crypto natives have been saying it - now even the Fed is confirming it. Vice Chair Michelle Bowman just warned that banks will become irrelevant if they don't embrace blockchain. This isn't a fringe take anymore - it's the Fed telling banks: evolve or die.

That is massive for crypto and if you're not bullish after hearing this, you don't understand what's happening. Tokenization was singled out as the immediate use case - and that's exactly where Ethereum, Stellar, and RWA-focused projects are already heading. The rails of the new financial system are being laid in real time.

And here's the kicker: more and more people are choosing to go fully bankless, living 100% in crypto. Platforms like Nеxо make that shift possible. According to Galaxy's latest report, Nеxо is already the #2 largest global lender, second only to Tether. Pair that with their award-winning crypto card and daily compounding interest and you're looking at the blueprint for Finance 2.0.

Yes, markets have short-term pullbacks. But zoom out and you'll see more and more institutions are scaling in every month, regulators are literally urging banks to adopt crypto, and the credit/liquidity infrastructure is stronger than ever. The writing is on the wall: the bull run isn't over, it's only just starting.

There are also many claims that this cycle could be the last ""classic 4-year cycle"" as we know it - but it's certainly shaping up to be the most epic one yet. The next few months will print so much generational wealth that entire bloodlines will go from retail investors to old money elite status in a single run.

Bears and fudders will keep shouting, but history always proves them wrong. Conviction is what separates those who make generational wealth from those who end up as the exit liquidity.

First, its BTC pumping, then its ETH(we are here). Soon it's going to be SOL and then finally alt season before the bull run ends.

Remember ETH during May-June when it was still BTC season and ETH dumped from 2800 to 2200 but BTC was still around 100k? Now that its ETH season, ETH is pumping but alts aren't pumping as much. Sure, some alts may have gotten gains, but most haven't been able to beat ETH gains. The same happened in 2021

The only logical thing to do after this observation seems like to follow the cycle; buy BTC when its BTC season followed by ETH. When ETH stops, then move onto other large market caps and then alts when it's confirmed alt season. This is a message to those of you who bought DOGE, ADA, SUI. Have you thought of the potential gains if you bought ETH instead?

edit: a lot of the comments are saying that it's ""too late"" when the cycle shifts. Here's a comparison to prove that is completely wrong.

Cryptocurrency	Jul 14	Jul 28	Aug 11	Aug 25

ETH	$2,974	$3,864	$4,253	$4,773

ADA	$0.73	$0.83	$0.80	$0.91

SUI	$3.5 	 $4.3	$3.9 	$3.7

Saying that it was ""late"" to buy ETH at 3000 while holding other alts is a ridculous claim",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1mz66g4/why_do_people_buy_alts_when_its_not_alt_season_yet/,0,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, ADA",positive
1mz7f27,250M in crypto longs liquidated in 30 minutes.. why and what's next!,hodorrny,0,15,2025-08-24 21:02:43,"A website just reported that $250M worth of long positions were liquidated within half an hour. This marks one of the sharper leverage resets in recent weeks.

The size and speed of the liquidations suggest positioning was heavily skewed to the long side. Once prices moved lower, forced liquidations accelerated the decline and drained liquidity from order books.

Points for traders to consider:

While $250M is not unprecedented, the concentration of liquidations in a short time window indicates crowded positioning.

Events like this reduce open interest and funding imbalances, which can lower near-term volatility.

The extent of recovery will depend on how quickly order flow stabilizes.

Key areas to monitor:

Whether BTC and ETH maintain critical support ranges over the next sessions.

Impact on altcoins, which often experience higher liquidation ratios.

Shifts in perpetual funding rates and open interest that could show whether leverage is rebuilding.

This was a clear example of how quickly leverage can reverse market direction.

My first idea was over several months try to buy both one share of Ethereum I thought by staking the purchases it would have longer-term earnings for my grands, thinking ahead in 10 years.💰💰

Anyone watching the volatile cryptocurrency knows that $1000 up and $1000 down if you’re not paying attention or unable to trade the stock -is a pretty big loss .
I suppose if you don’t count the gains daily and just wait for the long-term rise in hopes that it will happen using the bitcoin playbook , it makes sense.
However, I can’t seem to find the positives on staking some of these volatile cryptos.

1n00y68,september looks like a reset month for crypto trading — here’s what i’m watching,hodorrny,89,51,2025-08-25 20:00:43,"after a volatile summer, september is shaping up to be one of the first clean months for crypto in a while. bitcoin dominance is slowly rolling over, which usually signals traders are willing to move down the risk curve. altcoin liquidity is improving, not in a euphoric way, but in a steady, consistent way. at the same time, funding rates have reset after weeks of aggressive leverage, leaving us with a flatter and more sustainable setup.

i’m watching three main areas:

the fed meeting — if rate guidance remains dovish, risk assets should benefit, and crypto usually reacts first.

altseason index — it climbed noticeably in august, suggesting rotation could build momentum this month.

etf inflows — despite choppy markets, spot etfs are holding steady, which shows demand isn’t drying up.

september might not be an explosive run, but it looks healthier. traders can actually position without worrying about a giant liquidation cascade every week. i’m leaning into measured bets on higher beta names while keeping core btc/eth exposure steady. been using awaken.tax to track all the summer trades since things got messy with the volatility - definitely want clean records going into what could be a more active fall season.

what’s your setup this month? staying defensive, or leaning into the possibility of a rotation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1n00y68/september_looks_like_a_reset_month_for_crypto/,89,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

Which Microcaps Are You Watching?",Straight-Attitude488,43,76,2025-08-26 07:56:24,"With Ethereum climbing close to new all-time highs and Bitcoin dominance showing some interesting movements, many in the space are already preparing for the long-awaited altcoin season.

Historically, when ETH gains momentum, capital tends to flow into mid-caps and eventually into microcaps. We’re already seeing strong signs of stabilization and consolidation across the market – the kind of setup that often precedes explosive altcoin runs.

I’ve been researching different microcaps in the RWA (real-world asset) sector since that narrative is gaining traction. One example is **REM**, a utility token focused on real estate metaverse integration. It’s still tiny compared to others, but I find the microcap/RWA combo interesting given how ETH dominance is shaping up.

Curious to hear your thoughts:

* Do you think this ETH rally will trigger a proper altcoin season?
* Which sectors (AI, RWA, gaming, DeFi) do you think will benefit the most?
* Are there any microcaps you’re personally keeping an eye on?

1n0g4jq,"Mind-Blowing, Little-Known Crypto Concepts",Opening-Vacation-377,66,13,2025-08-26 08:19:11,"**1. Liquidity = Life Force**

* **What most don’t know:** A token can look “valuable” on CoinMarketCap, but without liquidity it’s just paper wealth. Price ≠ real exit.
* **Real-World Example:** Imagine your house is “valued” at $10 million. But if only one buyer is willing to pay $3 millions, your real liquidity is $3 millions. Same with low-liquidity coins → you *can’t sell at the displayed price*.
* **Insider Trick:** Always check “liquidity depth” in pools/exchanges before buying anything new.

**2. Tokenomics Beat Hype**

* **What most don’t know:** Supply mechanics matter more than marketing. A token with infinite supply (like DOGE) behaves differently from a deflationary one (like ETH after EIP-1559).
* **Analogy:** Owning a business. One prints new shares every day (inflation), the other buys back shares (deflation). Which stock would you rather hold long-term?
* **Insider Trick:** Look at *vesting schedules*. If 80% of supply unlocks next month for insiders, price will crash.

**3. MEV (Miner/Maximal Extractable Value)**

* **What most don’t know:** Bots & validators *front-run your trades*.
* **Analogy:** You go to a gold shop to buy a coin. A middleman sneaks in, buys it 1 second before you, then sells it to you for 2% higher. That’s what bots do on Ethereum.
* **Insider Trick:** Use MEV-protected exchanges like **CowSwap** or aggregators to avoid silent losses.

**4. Stablecoins = Shadow Banking**

* **What most don’t know:** Tether (USDT) and USDC aren’t just “stable money,” they’re *unregulated central banks*. They print billions of “dollars” without full audits.
* **Analogy:** Imagine your neighborhood grocery issuing its own “gift coupons” and everyone in town starts using them as money. Suddenly, the grocery owner is more powerful than your local bank.
* **Insider Trick:** Always diversify stablecoin holdings (USDT + USDC + DAI) because one failing could wreck portfolios.

**5. Whale Games & Liquidity Hunts**

* **What most don’t know:** 90% of liquidation crashes are *engineered*. Whales push prices to trigger stop losses.
* **Analogy:** A shark sees a fishing net full of fish. He smashes the net to make the fish panic and scatter, then eats them cheap. Whales do the same → forcing liquidations to buy cheap.
* **Insider Trick:** Never place obvious stop-losses at round numbers (like $20,000 BTC). That’s *exactly* where whales hunt.

**6. Network Effects > Technology**

* **What most don’t know:** The “best” blockchain doesn’t always win. Adoption beats tech.
* **Analogy:** QWERTY keyboards are not the most efficient, but everyone uses them, so they dominate. Same with Bitcoin/Ethereum → their network adoption matters more than speed or cost.
* **Insider Trick:** Invest in ecosystems with strong developer + user community, not just fast transactions.

**7. Governance is Power**

* **What most don’t know:** In DAOs and DeFi, holding governance tokens = *controlling the protocol*. Insiders quietly accumulate governance tokens to steer projects in their favor.
* **Analogy:** Owning a few shares of a company doesn’t matter, but if you hold 51% voting rights, you can change the CEO. Same with DAOs.
* **Insider Trick:** Watch where venture capitalists accumulate governance tokens — they’re future puppet masters.

**8. Time Horizons Change Risk**

* **What most don’t know:** Every crypto strategy works… until it doesn’t.
* **Analogy:** Playing musical chairs. If you’re in for 30 seconds, you win. If you stay for 5 minutes, the music stops and you’re wrecked.
* **Insider Trick:** Decide *before entry* → is this a 1-hour trade, 3-month swing, or 5-year HODL? Otherwise you’ll get trapped.

**9. Narratives Pump Markets More Than Fundamentals**

* **What most don’t know:** Most bull runs are driven by *stories*, not facts. “DeFi Summer,” “NFT Boom,” “AI + Crypto.”
* **Analogy:** Think of fashion trends. It’s not about the *quality* of the fabric but the *story* behind it. Crypto markets behave the same.
* **Insider Trick:** Spot the next narrative before retail does → AI tokens, RWA (real-world assets), privacy, etc.

**10. Your Private Keys = Your Citizenship**

* **What most don’t know:** Owning crypto isn’t about speculation — it’s digital sovereignty.
* **Analogy:** Imagine your passport and bank account rolled into one key. If you lose it, you’re stateless and penniless. If you guard it, you’re your own nation.
* **Insider Trick:** Use multisig wallets or hardware wallets like Ledger/Trezor. Treat them like your passport + house deed combined.

I have a coupke of questions about crypto :
(Im a layman and a beginner so ill need as easy of explanations as possible)
1. In blockchain technology, the special codes that you have to match, are they unknown to everyone. I guess what i was confused about was that why cant someone just know what the special code that we have to match is using machines if machines are actually validating the codes.
2. In the normal coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, can someone be tracked if the entire transaction history is available in Blocks?
3. So apart from speed and tokens being a factor, are there things you can do on Bitcoin that you cant do in Ethereum or Solana and vice versa? 
4. Also are there ways to use these currencies to directly pay for things in the real world now without converting them into USFDT or USDC and which ones are best for that
5. Which Wallets are the best for someone like me (I live in Pakistan, idk if that matters)
6. Which currency exchanges are the best for me?
7. Nowadays for a beginner like me is it better to study coins and invest in them first or study coins a little and focus more on tokens and invest in them?
8. What is the best method of studying and investing in coins/tokens?
9. Any general advice you guys have for a beginner like me.

1n0okrb,Decentralized Operating System (new invention),proff_bajoe,1,2,2025-08-26 15:14:23,"Hey guys, So I've been working on a new protocol called the Marketplace which is a decentralized operating system that co-ordinates and economizes the execution of computational work across a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Where there is no barrier to the node participation.

Unlike proof-of-work systems, where nodes burn large amounts of energy to solve ""non-useful"" puzzles, the Marketplace organizes a peer-to-peer market of computational trade where nodes offload useful computational work called ""jobs"" directly to each other and pays in the system's native cryptocurrency, goldcoin(GDC). Effectively redirecting energy into real economic growth.

Security without ""Staking"" is achieved using Proof-of-Capability (PoC), a new ""sybil-resistant"" mechanism that selects and incentivizes a small committee (“whiterooms”) to validate and reach consensus on the result of jobs without boggling down the entire network with redundant execution. This allows the amount of jobs handled in parallel to scale directly with the amount of nodes on the network analogous to an OS on a multi-core device.

Real utility then comes from the ""services layer"" where nodes can compose stalls(modular services) into larger digital structures(e.g websites), and execute them regardless of size in near constant time by taking advantage of the parallel execution environment of the marketplace. The system’s monetary policy dynamically adjusts issuance such that price of execution is constant regardless of network load.

1n0yd9e,Ethereum Begins to Step Out of Bitcoin’s Shadow,SuccessOdd382,73,53,2025-08-26 21:24:09,"Over the past few months, the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum has started to look different from what the market has grown used to in previous cycles. Historically, Bitcoin has always acted as the anchor, setting the pace for the entire digital asset space. When Bitcoin surged, altcoins followed, and when it corrected, the rest of the market almost always lost steam. This time, however, Ethereum is beginning to show signs that it can sustain its own momentum even when Bitcoin softens.

Bitcoin recently slid to levels not seen in close to two months, giving back gains made during its strong August rally. In earlier years, such a retreat would normally drag the broader market down with it. Yet, instead of fading, Ethereum has gained renewed attention. Traders have been quick to position themselves around Ether, which touched a new record near US$4,955, a level that has shifted sentiment across the market.

One of the clearest indications of this shift comes from institutional flows. Exchange traded funds that track Bitcoin posted heavy outflows in August, with more than US$1 billion leaving those products. At the same time, Ether linked funds moved in the opposite direction, attracting around US$3.3 billion. Such a wide gap points to more than short term trading. It reflects a deliberate change in investor preference, where capital is beginning to migrate toward Ethereum as a primary holding rather than a secondary one.

The story, however, is not entirely one sided. Developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem are also drawing attention. The upcoming rollout of Bitlayer V2, which integrates Bitcoin native rollups, is expected to follow listings on large centralized exchanges such as Bitget. Alongside that, the introduction of BitVM, a model allowing EVM style smart contracts to function on the Bitcoin network, could create new ways for liquidity to remain within Bitcoin’s DeFi framework. These upgrades may help Bitcoin defend its long standing dominance.

Even so, what makes this market moment unique is the fact that Ethereum is finally being recognized as more than just a secondary option. Several growth drivers are working in its favor at once. Consistent inflows into Ether ETFs, rising demand for staking as a yield generating mechanism, and the rapid expansion of tokenized real world assets on its network are all contributing to its strength. Taken together, these factors suggest that Ethereum’s trajectory no longer needs to mirror Bitcoin’s in lockstep. Instead, it is starting to attract independent flows of capital, carving out a leadership role in its own right for the first time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1n0yd9e/ethereum_begins_to_step_out_of_bitcoins_shadow/,73,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

his words were pretty direct: “we are going to put our gdp on the blockchain so people can use it for data and distribution.”

this is not just some side comment. he tied it directly to trump being “the crypto president,” so it looks like this is coming from the top. they are starting with gdp figures, but it could spread to other departments if the pilot works.

other countries already tried similar stuff:

estonia put medical records on chain back in 2016

european commission launched ebsi in 2018 for public services

california dmv put 42 million car titles on avalanche in 2024

singapore and australia both tested trade docs on blockchain

so in reality the us is catching up.

the timing is interesting: trump has been saying for months that official economic numbers are rigged. he even fired the bls commissioner in august. putting gdp on chain makes it transparent, but it doesn’t fix accuracy if the source data is bad.

the tax implications alone are going to be interesting. companies like awaken.tax that specialize in crypto compliance are probably going to see a surge in demand as more government data moves on-chain and creates new reporting requirements.

eth inflows now average about 0.9 billion per day according to willy woo, which is closing in on bitcoin’s current pace. this surge coincides with bitmine’s continued eth accumulation that has been expanding their treasury.

with whale wallets moving hundreds of millions between btc and eth, the tax reporting complexity is getting insane. each rotation from bitcoin profits into ethereum creates taxable events that need precise tracking across multiple chains and exchanges. platforms like awaken.tax are seeing a surge in whale-tier clients trying to sort through these massive cross-asset moves, especially when you factor in the perpetual positions and defi allocations on top of spot trades.

* **Bitcoin (BTC):** Stabilizing after last week’s dip. Despite minor intraday swings, the daily structure still looks healthy with higher lows forming.
* **Ethereum (ETH):** Continues pushing toward new highs. ETH dominance has been climbing steadily since June, signaling strong altcoin momentum.
* **Altcoins:** Many are in accumulation zones, waiting for BTC volatility to settle. Historically, ETH strength + declining BTC dominance has led to mini alt seasons.

One sector worth noting is **Real World Assets (RWA)**.

* Traditional players like **Huawei Labs (Horizon platform)** are enabling stablecoin loans against real estate and treasuries.
* On the microcap side, projects like **$REM** are exploring fractional property ownership and collateralization, aiming to capture the same narrative but with retail accessibility.

* BTC consolidation + ETH breakout attempts = a potentially bullish setup for altcoins.
* RWAs could emerge as the next major narrative if institutions keep validating the model.

Last week my portfolio went up around 2% ( it was around 79 USDC to be exact) and in that moment I thought to myself, that is pretty good , let me take the profits ( I know they’re small ) I sold the BTC and the ETH ( to the amount of profit ) I still have around 2k invested in BTC and around 1k in ETH, so thats still there. Today the same thing happened to me again, my portfolio was almost 2% ( around 70 USDC ) up and I decided to not the the profits, some time passed and itd already down 0.99% ( 34.63 USDC). 
My question is , should I take these small profits, convert them to USDC, wait for the lows and invest them into BTC, ETH, or any other coin, or should I leave the money go up and down and let “ nothing happen “

1n308fu,The Trump Shockwave + September Rate Cuts: Crypto’s End of Summer Setup,Series7Trader,40,36,2025-08-29 06:45:42,"August 29, 2025

Bitcoin is holding $110K. ETH can’t keep up. Solana won’t quit. The Trump family just dropped a $6.4B crypto bomb of goodness. And the Fed is about to cut rates for the first time in millions of years.

Compression plus politics plus macro colliding in real time.

# BTC = Compression

BTC ripped to $124K, then got stuffed.  
Now it’s stuck. $110K to $118K.  
Volatility is high. Direction is missing.

Above $120K = breakout, rally resumes.  
Below $109K = correction, risk off. Will be a testy week or so.  
Compression is the market loading a spring.

# ETH = Tired. SOL = Strong.

ETH is lagging. ETF inflows can’t push ETH/BTC higher. Dominance is stretched. Structure is bullish, but tired.

Solana is leading. SOL has relative strength. SOL ecosystem coins are catching volume. When the market is indecisive, relative strength is the tell.

Alts overall? Classic late cycle. They pump, they fade, they die. No follow through. They need coat tails to ride.

# Trump = Shockwave

Trump Media + Crypto dot com = $6.4B digital asset treasury. CRO doubled.  
American Bitcoin ABTC, backed by Trump’s sons, is **listing on Nasdaq in September**.  
This is politics wiring into crypto at scale.

This headline won’t fade. It’s sticky flow. Sticky flow drives trades.

# September = Rate Cuts

The Fed is cutting. Powell Vader hinted at Jackson Hole. Sith Lord Waller confirmed it. Futures are pricing it at almost 90%. 25 bps mid September.\* First cut of the cycle. More to come.  
Liquidity coming back into the system. Liquidity is the real rocket fuel.

BTC will feel it first. ETFs will feel it second. Alts will ride if BTC clears its gate.

\*By the time we get there, a ton of the action will already be priced in. Will be important to be careful on rate decision day.

# ETFs = Fuel. Regulation = Chop.

ETF inflows are alive. BTC ETFs +80M. ETH ETFs +300M. Institutions still buying dips.

Regulation is alive too. SEC has a new enforcer. Treasury and CFTC want public feedback. Rulebook not finished. Market already trading on it (pricing it in).

Fuel plus chop. That’s the rhythm of late August.

# Blueprint for the Crawl

Watch the BTC gates: 109K and 120K.  
Favor SOL until ETH gets its legs back.  
Don’t fade Trump headlines. Narrative plus politics is sticky.  
Rate cuts mean liquidity. Liquidity means risk on.  
Heavy trades wait for September resolution.  
Q4 is shaping up to be a total barn burner. Which is the setup for 2026.

This is not a quiet August.  
Spring is coiling. **Compression + politics + macro + liquid = liftoff.**

Good:

* User-friendly interface for prices, charts, and watchlists: CoinMarketCap's design emphasizes simplicity, allowing easy navigation for real-time data tracking, which is why it's often recommended for casual users.
* Great for beginners with educational resources: The platform's Academy section provides comprehensive free content on crypto basics, helping newcomers understand terms and markets without overwhelming them.
* Binance backing means vast data access: Since the 2020 acquisition by Binance, CoinMarketCap integrates extensive exchange data, offering detailed rankings and metrics for over 10,000 cryptocurrencies.

Bad:

* Data inaccuracies and fake volumes: Investigations have shown inflated trading volumes from certain exchanges, leading CoinMarketCap to implement transparency measures like liquidity scores to combat wash trading.
* Spam-filled community forums: The forums suffer from automated bots and promotional spam, prompting moderation rules, but users still report difficulty finding meaningful discussions amid the noise.
* Glitchy app and ads everywhere: App users frequently encounter bugs like crashing during high volatility, while pervasive ads disrupt the experience, especially on mobile versions.

Ugly:

* Overloaded with scams; easy for newbies to get rug-pulled: The site's vast listings include high-risk tokens without sufficient vetting, making it a common entry point for fraudulent schemes that exploit inexperienced investors.
* Poor support and slow updates: Customer service is often described as unresponsive, with delays in data refreshes during market events frustrating traders who rely on timely information.

At the same time, corporate treasuries are accumulating aggressively, now holding an estimated 4.4M ETH. That is 3.7% of total supply, worth over $19B.

Put together, ETFs and treasuries alone represent more than $32B of ETH essentially removed from circulation. And unlike traders, these institutions are not looking to sell. Their mandate is accumulation and long term holding.

Add in staked ETH, DeFi collateral locks, and long term holders, and the amount of truly liquid ETH available for trading keeps shrinking. Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets recently said: “Treasury companies are a massive buyer. They will not sell. The impact will stay.”

The tax implications of this institutional shift are becoming clearer too. Many retail holders are using platforms like awaken.tax to properly track their ETH transactions as they decide whether to hold through what could be a major supply crunch or take profits along the way. The institutional buying pressure is forcing individual investors to think more strategically about their positions.

This is the same playbook we watched unfold with Bitcoin. ETFs and corporate treasuries quietly cornered supply until the market finally woke up.

1n48grl,BMNR = The Ethereum MicroStrategy?,Brilliant_Builder697,5,3,2025-08-30 18:12:50,"Just watched a Tom Lee interview and I’m trying to piece together how this fits into the $BMNR vision. Can someone sanity-check if I’m reading this right?

**BMNR = Secular Bet on Ethereum’s Institutional Future**

* **Ethereum as Infra** → ETH is digital oil powering programmable finance.
* **Institutional Adoption** → BMNR gives Wall St + retail a *stock ticker gateway* into Ethereum, with treasury leverage layered on top.
* **Stablecoin/Tokenization Boom** → With the GENIUS Act and regulatory clarity, BMNR sees ETH as the dominant L1 for tokenized assets and financial rails.
* **AI Integration** → ETH as the back-end for AI agents. BMNR wants to own/stake ETH to secure the rails that AI will eventually run on.
* **5% Network Goal** → Long-term target = own 5% of ETH’s network through holdings + ecosystem participation.
* **Treasury Strategy** → Think MicroStrategy, but for ETH. Instead of just stacking coins, BMNR adds upside by being plugged into infra and tokenization plays.

Now this is shockingly obvious, and one can only think that it is wrong but it is impossible to avoid the **MicroStrategy analogue**:

$BTC rose 11x in 2020–2021

$MSTR rose 30x, thanks to the market premium on its treasury strategy + conviction

**BMNR is already showing similar leverage:**

$ETH rose 1.5x (Jun → Jul 2025)

$BMNR rose 9.5x over the same period — a 6x multiplier on ETH gains.

I would be happy if BMNR 3x ETH's gains. Do you think the market keeps rewarding BMNR with that multiplier… or does this kind of premium always mean-revert? So… is this a fair take?

1n5knyp,Bitcoin bouncing at support? Weekly BTC market update,discrete_moment,1,8,2025-09-01 10:00:46,"**Bitcoin pulled back and closed the week right at the breakout level from back in July. This is the obvious place to buy the dip. The conservative price target of $142k remains.**

In tradfi, the big thing this week was the NVIDIA earnings report that came in on Wednesday. They didn’t smash it out of the ballpark with this one, which disappointed the markets a bit. But big picture the numbers were good — the demand for chips is still strong, as the tech overlords keep building out data centers to feed their LLM beasts. As I’ve said before, at some point the AI train is going to run off the tracks and crash. But for now it’s still on, chugging along just fine.

Zooming out a little, the issue of inflation and Fed rate cuts is still very much front and center. Markets have been in somewhat of a stand-by mode over the past couple of weeks, waiting for clarity. A rate cut at the September 17 meeting seems very likely; right now the market has it at 90% probability. But the impact of tariffs on the economy and prices is still not clear, and the markets are left waiting for more signs before they decide which way to go.

This has also been reflected in bitcoin, which by now has spent 7 weeks consolidating after the breakout in early July. The bitcoin chart this week is more interesting than usual though, as it has come right down to test the 109k breakout level. Going back to test the level of a breakout like this is not uncommon, and it’s usually the logical place to buy the dip. So let's see if it can find support here and bounce.

The BTC price target of 142k still remains. Price has to fall down below 100k before the breakout pattern (and price target) is invalidated. And so far we’re nowhere near that level. That said, the chart will look better if we bounce here.

Looking to the bitcoin dominance, there is no change since last week. It’s still heading down, meaning altseason is still on.

All in all, there is no reason for concern yet. Let’s see what the coming week brings!

thomas prévot from [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) dropped this at waib summit: ""within 10 years, we'll reach 5 billion users. we're about one growth cycle away from full mainstream adoption.""

not 1 billion users. 5 billion users.

the numbers are wild

we hit 659 million crypto holders by end of 2025 - that's 8% of world population already. if we hit 5 billion users, crypto becomes as ubiquitous as credit cards for payments.

the math gets insane

if 5 billion people hold an average $5,000 in crypto, that's a $25 trillion market. current market cap is \~$3.8 trillion.

willy woo predicted $700k bitcoin at mainstream adoption. if we're talking 5 billion users, that math might be conservative.

timing: 2027-2030

prévot says this happens after the next bear market, at the beginning of the following bull run. we're looking at 2027-2030 for mainstream breakout.

infrastructure is ready

payment rails, institutional custody, regulatory clarity, better ux - it's all being built right now.

# tax complexity will explode

if 5 billion people are using crypto regularly, the tax reporting nightmare is going to be unreal. even now with just 659 million users, most people are struggling to track everything properly. i've been using awaken.tax to stay organized because once mainstream adoption hits, the irs is definitely going to get more aggressive about crypto compliance.

* Bitcoin trades near 108K-109k after closing August around 109K
* The 112K–115K band is the key resistance zone; failure to reclaim it risks a move down to 103K support
* The MVRV momentum death cross is flashing, a bearish signal but not always decisive
* September is historically Bitcoin’s weakest month, averaging a 4–5% drop since 2010
* Fed rate cuts are heavily priced in with 85–90% odds for September
* Deutsche Bank expects a 25bps cut in September and possibly another in December
* Crypto often flips the script when sentiment leans too bearish

# Market Snapshot

* Spot price: -108K-109k at time of writing
* Resistance zone: 112K to 115K
* Support zone: 103K
* Seasonality: September average return since 2010 = −4% to −5%
* Macro: September Fed rate-cut odds = mid-80s to near 90%

# Bitcoin Price Levels to Watch

Bitcoin wrapped up August near 109,000 and is now trading near 109,000. The 112,000 to 115,000 band is the immediate resistance zone. If Bitcoin cannot break above and hold this range, many Bitcoin technical analysis models point to 103,000 as the next major support. A retest of that level could trigger billions in liquidations for leveraged longs.

# The MVRV Death Cross Signal

On-chain analysts are watching the MVRV momentum death cross. This indicator has lined up with bearish phases in the past, but it isn’t absolute. Crypto is famous for faking out both bulls and bears, so a death cross is a caution flag rather than a guaranteed breakdown.

# Rektember: Bitcoin’s Seasonal Weakness

Since 2010, September has been Bitcoin’s weakest month. Average returns sit in the negative 4% to 5% range. Some shorter datasets show closer to 3% to 4%, but the story is the same: September has a history of red candles. That is where the name “Rektember” comes from.

# Fed Rate Cuts and Market Expectations

Bearish? Not so fast. Macro conditions could change the script. The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are widely expected to cut interest rates in September. Odds sit around the mid-80s to near 90% in futures markets. Major banks including Goldman Sachs, Citi, and UBS forecast as much as 100 basis points of easing across 2025.

Deutsche Bank projects a 25bps cut in September and suggests another may follow in December. Lower interest rates add liquidity and typically boost risk on assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market.

# Bitcoin Price Prediction for September 2025

* **Bearish case:** BTC fails to reclaim 112K–115K, rejects lower, and tests 103K support.
* **Neutral case:** BTC ranges between 108K and 115K as traders wait for the Fed decision.
* **Bullish case:** The Fed cut energizes risk on. Liquidity flows, and Bitcoin reclaims 115K with a push toward 120K.

# FAQ

**Is the MVRV death cross always bearish for Bitcoin?**  
No. It flags weakening momentum, but context from liquidity and positioning matters.

**Why does September often hurt BTC performance?**  
Historical monthly returns skew negative in September. It is a seasonality effect, not a rule.

**Are rate cuts already priced into Bitcoin?**  
Mostly. If policy eases faster or deeper than expected, BTC can still surprise to the upside.

**What invalidates the bearish September case?**  
A clean reclaim and hold above 115K, stronger breadth, and a Fed move that exceeds expectations.

Now that I’m getting older (28) I’m going to start investing heavily. My question is would it be more beneficial to put a couple to 5 hundred dollars a side each month towards crypto?

1n6hhzk,At least there’s something good. 🙃,SpanishGazpacho,2,1,2025-09-02 11:58:17,"I’ve been trying to become a bit more active in this space now, but I’m still quite new to writing all this, so don’t judge me too much lol. 


So, as many have pointed out nicely, crypto is in an interesting position now, BTC has had its run, some still want to see those epic 200k, I don’t it will happened in the upcoming 3 months. 

ETH has also had its run, not as huge as we’d like compared to its old ATHS, barely 500€ over them (Jan 2025). But it gave many a great opportunity to enter positions when it dumped to 1.300. Which was pretty much when ETH bottomed out against BTC. 

This gives us the idea of what the next bull runs could look like for ALTs, we want alts to bottom out against BTC, or even ETH, why? Alts finding bottom vs ETH  is one of the signs that the bleeding phase is done and strength might be shifting back to alts. Thats when we start seeing alts outperforming ETH. Hopefully we’ll see this in November or so. 

So why I think BTC will be a going aggressively sideways, we eliminated a lot of leveraged positions with the pullback, and constant spikes up will be doing the same for the shorts.  Which creates uncertainty on the Btc charts, and market divides quite equally into bulls and bears while Btc just takes out both. Also ETF inflows have supported BTC, but the enthusiasm has tapered off. This leads to my idea about Alt run, money starts to flow into alts, after ETH ofc. 

Market is “strange”, but at least we’re seeing quite some volatility, which is a great thing, ofc being up 10% on one day and -10% on the next one isn’t easy, but volatility is always a great indicator of market starting to catch up, ofc we might just dump on all alts, which is what’s going to happen for the next weeks probably, unless there’s some very very interesting news or geopolitical events.

Rome collapsed due to reaching the breaking point of centralization. 

The city states that took its place in the massive reshuffle were ones that invested in arts and culture to attract the best minds, leading to a cultural renaissance.

You look at the dearth of culture we have today, and it's hard not to imagine we're at the tail end of a centralization period.

This is why BTC keeps going up. The world is asking for decentralization.

Picturing a post-crypto adoption world, it's hard not to imagine a massive reshuffling of culture.

This is the deeper thesis on memecoins being the play this cycle. They're not just memes, they're cultural stores of value. 

Bitcoin is perfect in its neutrality, but memecoins are an extrapolation, allowing communities to set cultural values to the money.

I think we're entering a period where crypto is returning to its roots. It's crypto \*currency\*.

The tech, the gambling, whatever the latest narrative is is all BS to take your money. We should just be storing our value in communities (aka currencies) that align with our values.

1n7z0wg,bitcoin just broke its september curse for the third year straight,hodorrny,28,34,2025-09-04 03:01:53,"september has historically been bitcoin's worst month. the numbers don't lie - it averaged -3.77% returns over 12 years from 2013. but we've now had three consecutive positive septembers, including 2024's best september ever at +7.29%.

why september was always brutal

the pattern started during the ico boom in 2017. china banned icos on september 4th, south korea followed on september 29th. that triggered six consecutive red septembers from 2017-2022.

here's what made each september terrible:

2017: china's ico ban triggered the first crypto winter
2018: goldman sachs ""fake news"" about abandoning crypto desk plans. btc had already dropped from $20k to under $7k
2019: bakkt's bitcoin futures launched to weak volumes and disappointing institutional interest
2020: capital rotated into eth during defi summer 
2021: china banned crypto mining and trading entirely
2022: terra/luna collapse aftermath plus fed raised rates 0.75% (the fifth hike that year)

 what changed in 2023-2024

the streak finally broke in 2023 when a federal court ruled the sec's rejection of grayscale's btc etf was ""arbitrary and capricious."" that ruling happened august 29th and carried momentum into september.

2024 was even better. we had:

spot bitcoin etfs already approved and trading billions daily

fed cut rates for the first time since march 2020 (september 18th)

trump's world liberty financial launch got crypto into election narratives

2025 setup looks different

this september we're going in with:
- established etf infrastructure pulling in institutional money
- companies adding btc to treasury strategies 
- rumors about china potentially allowing offshore yuan stablecoins
- fed chair powell's dovish jackson hole speech hinting at more rate cuts
- fomc meeting september 16-17 where another cut is widely expected

the tax implications are cleaner too

one thing that's changed is how people track their crypto transactions. platforms like awaken.tax have made it easier for retail investors to handle the complexity of frequent trading without worrying about tax season disasters. this removes some of the fear that used to drive september selling as people prepared their books for year-end.

 historical context

september being weak isn't just a bitcoin thing. it's historically the worst month for the s&p 500 too. investors return from summer with risk-off attitudes and funds rebalance for q4.

but the pattern often reverses in october. bitcoin has posted gains in six consecutive octobers with only two losses in its entire history.

 my take

the regulatory environment that created the september curse is largely gone. china already did their worst damage. the us has clarity with etfs approved. rate cuts instead of hikes.

we've broken the psychological barrier three years running now. the question is whether institutional flows and macro conditions can keep this momentum going or if we revert to the historical pattern.

key things to watch:
fed meeting september 16-17
etf flows throughout the month  
any regulatory surprises from other jurisdictions

SOL - Continued high onchain activity driven by memes and also propAMMs giving better execution on highly liquid trades, further DAT adoption, ETF acceptance, high RWA activity(not just tokenizing for tokenization's sake, but actually trading them, like stocks, pokemon cards, etc)

HYPE - people keep trading on Hyperliquid, it keeps making millions in fees every day and buying back HYPE with it. Kind of a no-brainer. Spot trading and HyperEVM should also be relatively small catalysts.

BONK/PENGU - Both have good sentiment and active teams supporting it. Pudgy Penguins have great brand visibility outside of crypto and support from Abstract within crypto. Bonk has great brand visibility inside crypto and various initatives that help with tokenomics. Neither are very highly valued compared to things like DOGE or SHIB.

AERO - Coinbase keeps funneling activity from the exchange to Base which benefits the leading DEX there.

the framework warns that trillions of dollars in digital assets could be exposed if today's encryption methods collapse under quantum attacks. we're talking about a complete breakdown of bitcoin, ethereum, and basically every crypto's security foundation.

here's the scary part - adversaries are already collecting sensitive encrypted data to unlock once quantum breakthroughs arrive. it's called ""harvest now, decrypt later"" and it's happening right now.

the proposal calls for immediate action including automated vulnerability assessments and phased migration to quantum-resistant cryptography. bitcoin devs already proposed freezing old vulnerable addresses within 5 years.

el salvador even split their $678m bitcoin holdings across 14 wallets to reduce quantum risk - that's how real this threat is becoming.

if quantum computers crack crypto before we upgrade, we're looking at systemic collapse. massive investor losses, exchange chaos, complete market confidence breakdown.

	•	Consensus is around +75K jobs added with unemployment ticking up to 4.3%. That’s pretty soft compared to what we used to see.

	•	If the report comes in weak or even lower than expected, it basically screams that the labor market is cooling Fed more likely to cut rates dollar weakens liquidity improves. That’s usually bullish for Bitcoin and other risk assets.

	•	On the flip side, if we get a strong surprise (like +150K+ jobs, unemployment steady or lower), then the Fed might feel less urgency to cut. Strong dollar + higher yields = short-term headwind for BTC.

	•	The extreme case: very weak data (<40K, unemployment >4.4%) could even have markets talking about a 50 bps cut. That kind of panic liquidity shift could send Bitcoin flying.

1nan64e,TGE Countdown for my Crypto Game: Any Advice?,No_Evening8416,0,1,2025-09-07 07:39:53,"Every TGE has a story behind it. Maybe it's a meme, or an app, or an interesting blockchain function. In my case, it's the game I've been building for the last several months.

We've built the app, planned the economy, run the testnet, and we're about ready for our first on-chain token launch. 

My question is: Do y'all have any advice, insights, interesting obesrvations, cool suggestions, or general thoughts on the whole TGE thing?

# Why a Crypto Game? Games are what I do

I'm a game developer, it's what I do and have done for over a decade. Web3 is new and interesting, and my little two-person studio decided to take a crack at it. We've built something cool, I think, with strategies designed to overcome common crypto-game problems to ensure long-term gameplay, immunity to whale overtakes, ensuring a free-to-play and affordable thresshold for players who aren't big spenders, and so on.

I know crypto games have seen their heyday but there's still an audience out there theoretically. We're targeting free players, play-to-earn players, NFT collectors, and anyone who's into unique implementations of web3 technology. Because creative feature-building is actually what we like best.

# The Token: CC ORI

The game lore is actually built around crypto-metals with magic qualities on ETH, BTC, and SOL. The first metal/coin is Orichalcum (a real historical alloy of myth and legend), which is glowy green with nature/Gaia energy.

You can use the crypto metals to craft NFT equipment or trade both in and out of the game. Combined with the other two coins, in-game arbitrage is also possible. 

There are tons of integrated features. Like fighting a boss to buy the token (prevent non-player whale takeovers) and seeding the world with free coins with each purchase (for play-to-earners)

# The TGE and Pre-Sale

So we're getting ready for the TGE and part of that is the pre-sale we launched today, which allows for launch-day airdrops without fighting your way to the Shrine, where battle-purchases occur.

The idea is to generate some hype (and runway funds) with play-to-earn players and possibly small coin collectors.

# What do you think?

I'm not just talking about the coin launch here, I also really want to hear from the crypto community. What do you think of the TGE, the pre-sale, and our overall strategy?

Questions? Ideas? The game is still in development even with our first TGE looming so if you can think of something really cool or have an insightful question, your ideas could wind up in the game within the next month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nan64e/tge_countdown_for_my_crypto_game_any_advice/,0,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",positive
1naxldt,"Bitcoin mining difficulty hit 134.7T even as hashrate dropped — miners getting squeezed, what does this mean for price?",dumble_hold_the_door,34,16,2025-09-07 16:24:28,"bitcoin mining difficulty just set another all time high at 134.7 trillion. what’s odd is this happened while the total hashrate actually slipped from over 1 trillion h/s in early august to about 967 billion today.

so we’re looking at fewer hashes securing the network but a tougher environment for miners. that means margins are getting destroyed. smaller miners with higher energy costs are basically being forced out, while the big corporate operations with cheap power and next-gen hardware dominate.

this raises two possible outcomes:

bullish supply squeeze : public miners and industrial-scale players tend to hoard more bitcoin rather than dump. if small miners are forced offline, the circulating supply hitting exchanges could shrink. that’s historically set the stage for price rallies.

bearish capitulation risk : at the same time, thin margins often push stressed miners to sell reserves to cover electricity and debt. we’ve seen in past cycles how waves of miner selling can trigger sharp corrections.

a fun twist: three solo miners still managed to hit blocks in july and august. one pocketed $373k with what was probably a tiny setup compared to giants. so the “underdog wins” story is still alive.

from a tax perspective, this miner shakeout is creating some wild situations. many smaller operations are having to liquidate btc holdings they've been sitting on for years, triggering massive capital gains events. some are scrambling with tools like awaken.tax to calculate the tax implications of selling mining rewards from different time periods at various cost bases. it's messy when you're forced to liquidate under pressure rather than planning strategic tax-loss harvesting.

what’s your take? does this difficulty spike mean bullish accumulation or another miner-driven correction coming soon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1naxldt/bitcoin_mining_difficulty_hit_1347t_even_as/,34,1,1,BTC,neutral
1nb0ivz,"How might the Fed’s possible rate cuts affect crypto markets, and should I be worried about my HBAR positions?",nvsc7,0,10,2025-09-07 18:17:14,"Hi everyone,

This is actually my first time really paying attention to the Fed and their potential interest rate decisions, so I’m trying to understand how this might impact the crypto market. With rate cuts possibly coming soon (maybe tomorrow), I’ve read that lower rates historically encourage more risk-taking, which could push crypto prices higher, but at the same time, short-term volatility is likely as traders react.

I’m holding HBAR with liquidation prices around 0.05 and 0.1207, and I’m wondering how cautious I should be. Should I expect a strong market reaction, or is this more of a gradual shift?

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

How do Fed decisions typically influence crypto sentiment?

1nboj0o,LTC stands for Long Term Crypto,Brewersty,9,19,2025-09-08 14:00:41,"While everyone’s chasing trends, LTC quietly stacking every reason for a breakout and barely anyone’s talking about it.

Here’s why I believe LTC is preparing for its most explosive move yet in 2025.

# 1/ The MEIP Effect

Most coins dream of attention from big money, Litecoin has it.  
MEI Pharma invested $100M exclusively into LTC, and that number recently doubled to $200M.  
This is a treasury strategy, a long-term hold.  
If the allocation grows to $400M, $600M, or more, that’s 4-5% of total supply potentially removed from circulation permanently.

# 2/ 4.2M LTC Could Be Gone From Markets Forever

Based on wallet behavior, an estimated 4.2M LTC (\~5% of the total supply) may be locked up for good.  
Whether for treasury, cold storage, or strategic reserve, this silent drain creates one of the most favorable supply dynamics in crypto today.  
And with a fixed supply of just 84M and emission already halved, every LTC off the market matters.

# 3/ Valuation Gap is Wild

At $113 and an $8.7B mcap, Litecoin looks like a forgotten relic to many.

But let’s zoom out:  
– Same decentralized architecture as BTC  
– Faster, cheaper, and more scalable  
– Clear legal classification as a commodity by the CFTC, no SEC drama  
– Used more for payments than any other coin on BitPay  
– Second most used for payments on CoinGate, NOWPayments & Bitrefill  
– Integrated into PayPal, Visa, Coinbase, Robinhood, Fidelity

It’s the most used crypto for payments globally and it trades at 1.5% of Bitcoin’s price.

# 4/ Litecoin is the Infrastructure You Forgot Was There

People forget:  
– First coin to activate SegWit  
– First Lightning Network tx happened on Litecoin  
– MWEB privacy upgrade already live  
– 14 years uptime, no hacks, no scandals, no drama.

# 5/ The Asymmetry is Real

Here’s a thought experiment:

* If BTC = $500K, and Litecoin reverts to just 5% of BTC’s value, LTC = $25K
* If BTC = $1M, and Litecoin climbs to 10%, LTC = $100K Even conservatively, LTC at $1K is a fundamentally sound bet ,not just hopium

# 6/ Not a Narrative Play

Litecoin isn’t trying to be the next Solana, not chasing AI, gaming, or memecoins.  
It’s simply sound money.  
No pre-mine, no central issuer, no VC tax, no ambiguity. Just pure, peer-to-peer digital cash the way Satoshi intended.  
And in a world increasingly divided between regulated assets and speculative chaos, that clarity is going to matter.  
Sometimes, you just need to pay attention to what’s quietly winning.  
Litecoin might be the most inevitable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nboj0o/ltc_stands_for_long_term_crypto/,9,1,1,"BTC, SOL, LTC",positive

BTC & ETH (obviously), SOL, XRP, HBAR, LINK, SUI, ADA. It's like every project has a cult following and a thesis that makes sense... which makes this a lot harder than I expected.

Right now, my main position is in eth - it's the one I have the most conviction in long-term, and it still feels like the ""base layer"" for where a lot of innovation is heading. I've also got smaller positions in BTC, SOL, XRP, and HBAR.

Here's the issue though - the list keeps growing. I want exposure to SUI, I like ADA's long-term vision, and LINK still feels like it hasn't had its real cycle yet. But I'm not working with unlimited capital, nor am I a whale. I don't want to end up spread so thin that none of my positions matter when the market moves.

I've been thinking about just staying concentrated in ETH, keeping everything on Nexo so far - not just because of the features, but because honestly I feel safer there than juggling cold wallets. I've even started borrowing against my ETH instead of selling, just to stay liquid without giving up exposure. It's worked for me so far, but I know there's no one-size-fits-all.

I know I can't own everything, but I also don't want to miss the next cycle just because I played it too safe. So how do you actually decide what's worth holding vs what's just noise?

1ncynai,"Macro Meets Crypto: CPI, PPI, and the Federal Reserve’s FOMC Decision",Series7Trader,3,1,2025-09-09 23:31:14,"**TL;DR:** U.S. inflation data (CPI and PPI) on September 10 will determine how markets position for the Federal Reserve’s September 17 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. A 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut is already priced in at more than 90% odds according to CME FedWatch. Without cooler-than-expected inflation and/or a larger policy move, risk assets may stall or fade. Scenarios:

* **Cool inflation + 25 bps cut:** Short-term bounce, upside capped.
* **Cool inflation + 50 bps cut:** Breakout scenario led by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins.
* **Hot inflation + 25 bps cut:** Choppy, range-bound, prone to fading rallies.
* **Hot inflation + no cut:** Sharp risk-off move, equities and digital assets sell off, stablecoin dominance spikes.

**Macro Setup:** CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) are the key U.S. inflation indicators driving monetary policy expectations. The Fed’s policy stance under Chair Jerome Powell is critical for both equities and digital asset markets. A 25 bps rate cut, already anticipated, risks being a classic “sell the news” event unless paired with dovish inflation data.

**Scenario Analysis:**

* **Cool CPI/PPI:** Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins could rotate higher ahead of the Fed, but unless TOTAL3 (total altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) breaks above the $1.09–$1.10T level, momentum may stall.
* **Hot CPI/PPI:** The Fed may still deliver the expected cut, but crypto assets likely remain range-bound or fade lower. Pre-FOMC strength would be vulnerable to quick reversals.
* **50 bps Surprise:** If combined with cool inflation data, this would be the cleanest breakout setup. Bitcoin (BTC) would likely lead, with ETH dominance firming and broad altcoin participation.
* **No Cut + Hot Data:** The nightmare outcome. Markets would reprice sharply risk-off, with equities selling off, digital assets flushing lower, and USDT dominance (USDT.D) reclaiming higher ground.

**Market Anchors:**

* **Bitcoin (BTC):** A daily close above $116K opens broader risk-on conditions; a break below $108K signals risk-off. Bitcoin typically outperforms in downside scenarios as a relative safety asset, but also suppresses altcoin upside when capped under resistance.
* **Ethereum (ETH):** Key driver of altcoin rotation. Strength in the ETH/BTC pair supports broader digital asset participation, but without Bitcoin confirmation, Ethereum-led rallies may struggle.
* **Liquidity Signals:** Monitor stablecoin dominance (USDT.D), risk sentiment in equities, and cross-asset flows to validate market direction.

**Simplified Playbook:**

* **Cool inflation + dovish Fed (50 bps) = breakout fuel**
* **Cool inflation + expected Fed move (25 bps) = short-lived bounce**
* **Hot inflation + modest cut = chop or fade**
* **Hot inflation + no cut = panic flush**

**Trader Takeaway:** U.S. macroeconomic data (CPI and PPI) sets the tone, but the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision determines whether crypto markets break out or stall. If Darth Powell surprises with more than expected, the green light turns on for a real rally. If not, expect range-bound price action and fading of initial pumps.

  


# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What are CPI and PPI, and why do they matter for crypto?**  
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) are U.S. inflation indicators. They guide Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions. Lower inflation supports rate cuts, which often fuel risk-on behavior in equities and digital assets.

**Q2: How does a 25 bps rate cut affect Bitcoin and Ethereum?**  
Since a 25 bps cut is already priced in, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) may initially pump but risk fading quickly. Sustained upside typically requires either cooler inflation data or a larger-than-expected cut.

**Q3: What is the impact of a 50 bps rate cut?**  
A 50 bps cut, especially with cool inflation, is the strongest breakout trigger. It would likely drive Ethereum dominance higher and ignite broad altcoin participation, with Bitcoin providing directional leadership.

**Q4: What is the worst-case scenario?**  
If inflation data runs hot and the Fed skips a cut, risk assets would sell off sharply. Equities and digital assets would face heavy downside, while stablecoin dominance (USDT.D) would spike as liquidity exits risk markets.

**Q5: What levels should traders watch?**

* Bitcoin: $116K breakout level, $108K risk-off trigger.
* TOTAL3: Breakout confirmation above $1.09–$1.10T.
* USDT.D: Rising dominance = risk-off signal.

**Q6: When is the key date?**

* September 10: CPI and PPI inflation data.
* September 17: FOMC meeting and Powell’s rate decision.

**Q7: What is the FOMC and how does it apply here?**  
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the branch of the Federal Reserve responsible for setting U.S. interest rates and monetary policy. Its decisions directly influence market liquidity, risk sentiment, and the cost of capital. For crypto, dovish moves like rate cuts can trigger rallies in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins, while hawkish or neutral moves often lead to range-bound trading or risk-off declines.

* September 10: CPI and PPI inflation data.
* September 17: FOMC meeting and Powell’s rate decision.

**Q8: Will the Fed cut rates in September 2025?**  
According to CME FedWatch, markets have priced in over 90% odds of a 25 bps cut at the September 17, 2025 FOMC meeting. This makes a small cut highly likely, though surprises (such as a 50 bps move) remain possible depending on inflation data.

**Q9: How does the CPI report affect crypto prices?**  
A cooler-than-expected CPI print tends to boost risk appetite, encouraging rallies in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. A hotter CPI reading raises inflation concerns, often capping crypto rallies or triggering sell-offs as investors anticipate tighter Fed policy.

1ndmjo8,Saw this wild claim from a Putin advisor - is the US really using stablecoins to manage its debt?,Kurosaki56843,20,42,2025-09-10 18:38:47,"So.. people on twitter have been losing it over a claim from Anton Kobyakov (senior advisor to Putin), who said at the Eastern Economic Forum that the U.S. is using stablecoins like USDT and USDC to offload its $35T+ debt and ""reset"" the system - basically comparing it to when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard.

Tbh, this sounded insane at first, but when you think about it, is it really? Some context:

* Stablecoin market cap = approx. $247B
* Tether & Circle now rank among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries (confirmed in Bitwise's latest data)
* The GENIUS Act, signed in July 2025, quietly tied stablecoin reserves to U.S. Treasury demand
* And yes this absolutely boosts dollar dominance globally

So while $35T is a stretch, the idea of the U.S. using stablecoins to deepen treasury demand (and eventually inflate away part of its debt) doesn't sound completely far-fetched. Especially if it maintains control of the rails.

But then again, this is also coming from a Russian official at a time when BRICS is pushing hard for de-dollarization and promoting their ruble-backed stablecoin (A7A5 on Tron). So yeah, take that with a grain of salt (the political one).

I'm not saying this scenario is likely, but it definitely made me think twice about having anything at all parked in stablecoins. I've been trying to stay liquid without selling, so I've been borrowing a bit against my BTC on Nехо instead of cashing out. Rates are decent, and it's helped me avoid messing with my long-term positions while still having room to move if things get weird.

1nf92wh,Preparing for the next Altseason,HassanGulzar,6,32,2025-09-12 17:17:49,"Hello, fellow crypto investors.

I would appreciate some feedback on a thought process my friend and I are pursuing. We are waiting for big-X returns on the next bull season for ALT coins, apparently phased as phase 4.

I have a plethora of minuscule amounts of many main and ALT coins. I plan to dump everything into USDT, and at the time of writing, it would roughly amount to 3400 USD. I'll have no other crypto.

Since 2018, I have been attempting to get a single BTC or at least an ETH, but have never made it beyond 0.08 BTC and 0.7 ETH. I have realized I do not ever have burnable money to go that high, and the moment I use some of my actual savings, I crash in RL after a month or two, ending up selling some actual crypto profits. So I'm stopping the BTC dream at the moment.

Not really able to recall where I got these narratives, I intentionally skipped Phases 1 & 2. We are focusing on phases 3 & 4:

What struck me afterward was discovering his interest in cryptocurrency. In clips from his show last summer, he discussed how cryptocurrency challenges government control over currency. ""That's why I am a crypto enthusiast,"" he said in some podcast. Throughout Trump's campaign, Kirk frequently highlighted his candidate's favorable stance on cryptocurrency, while noting Harris hadn't expressed similar support.
During the big crypto crash last December, Kirk actually said Bitcoin had more ""integrity"" than the US dollar because you can see exactly how many coins exist and track everything on the blockchain. 
I think the most interesting part is that Kirk mentioned back in February that he personally invested a lot in crypto infrastructure and tech, but he never said which coins he actually owned.
Just thought I'd share since I didn't realize he was this into crypto before all this happened.I’m not trying to get political or whatever but it’s kind of wild to see how much crypto has gotten mainstream. The way Kirk explained it, he basically saw Bitcoin as a kind of insurance policy against the dollar failing. He kept saying the dollar was ""slowly dying"" and that the only way to be free from government control was to own a decentralized asset. If you go look back at his old podcasts, he kept hyping up how most people were still sleeping on blockchain tech, and that it was gonna be ""bigger than the internet"" once people figured out how to use it for stuff other than just meme coins and speculation. I don’t know if I believe all the ""world changing"" hype, but it was interesting to hear him say it.

1nherrr,mainstream crypto adoption will be invisible,Weary-Hair-316,8,3,2025-09-15 06:50:04,"a major payments firm just turned on crypto at checkout for us merchants. near instant settlement and cross border fees that look a lot lower than usual.

to me this feels like the next phase of crypto adoption.  simple embedded payments inside apps people already use. you hit pay, it works. most users wont even notice they used crypto.

regulators are moving in the same direction. in europe there’s now a single rulebook for stablecoins. singapore set clear reserve and redemption rules. hong kong moved from pilots to full licensing. trading rules still differ by region, but payments have a path. stablecoins start to look like basic plumbing, not just speculative tokens.

if that’s right, the first time tens of millions use crypto at once they probably wont notice. wallets and apps will support various tokens and settle to stablecoin or fiat behind the scenes. the experience will feel like any other online payment, only faster and cheaper. it’s the practical way to get real people on board.

some will push back and say this hands too much power back to big payment firms. others worry about policy and systemic risk around stablecoins. fair points. we need strong audits, high-quality reserves, fast redemption, and real-time monitoring as a baseline. good oversight isnt anti-crypto. it lets the rails scale safely.

 many crypto apps were built for speculation. depth charts, pop-ups, and complicated staking flows. that scares normal users away. a parent sending money home or a freelancer invoicing abroad doesnt want buy the dip alerts. they want a clean on ramp, predictable fees, support that speaks their language, easy kyc like opening a bank account, and records that reconcile quickly. mobile first by default.

payments shift who benefits. traders arent the center of gravity. small businesses selling across borders and families sending money start to capture more value. when remittance or cross-border fees drop to card-like levels or better, volume follows. winners look more like regulated utilities than casinos.

i keep asking a simple question. what brings mainstream use faster: teaching seed phrases to everyone or hiding the complexity so the payment just clears? the second option feels closer to how tech usually spreads. email didnt win because people learned smtp. it won because it was everywhere.

none of this erases risk. policymakers still care about capital flows and consumer protection, and they should. offshore exchanges still matter. so do stablecoin issuers, banks, and market makers. but the center of gravity is shifting toward everyday payments with clearer rules and aligned incentives.

if you watch this space, focus less on trading headlines and more on the plumbing. which wallets and processors are live? how fast does redemption work in practice? what do reserve reports say? are there chargeback-like protections? the boring stuff decides whether a checkout button can scale.

maybe that's the story right now. crypto as visible speculation is giving way to crypto as invisible infrastructure. if it holds, the next bull case wont just be about price. it will be a steady migration of payment volume to rails that do the job faster and cheaper, inside the tools people already trust. for me awaken handles the merchant reporting side which matters more as payment volume scales up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nherrr/mainstream_crypto_adoption_will_be_invisible/,8,0,0,,positive
1nhetvk,"If GDP stats went on chain, would markets start setting rates in real time?",Rich_Flamingo_7701,4,3,2025-09-15 06:53:44,"Hey all, been thinking: if GDP stats go on chain do markets start setting rates in real time? Trying to work this out without hype. Lots of talk about posting official econ data on public chains. If we did that at scale what really changes for markets and for crypto?

1) Latency  
Right now big data drops at a set time, a few firms get it first, everyone else reacts. If the same numbers hit a public ledger with a clear timestamp and audit hash the feed is flatter. Oracles pull it. Bots read it. Price moves become code anyone can check. It does not make trading easy but it shifts the edge from data access to execution speed.

2) Revisions  
GDP and jobs reports get updated. If every release and revision is hashed on chain you get a full public log of what changed and when. That is great for transparency but also means you could see two shock moves first release and then the revision. Would traders start caring more about the “second print” than the first headline?

3) Rates and curves  
With high-quality open feeds money markets and prediction markets can react without waiting for a Fed press conference. The Fed still sets policy but the curve might “vote” faster. You could see bigger gaps between committee guidance and market pricing, shown in basis or swaps. Is that more disciplined or just more whipsaw?

4) Infrastructure risk  
Oracles become critical pipes. If they push bad data or go down, lending protocols, perp funding, even on-chain treasuries that rebalance off macro triggers all get hit. So incentives and governance for oracles matter. Who pays for uptime? Who gets slashed for errors? Treat oracles like exchanges, not just middleware.

5) Crypto asset moves  
Two things happen at once. Better on-chain data brings in traditional players who need auditability. But faster reactions can spike crypto’s macro correlations around releases. BTC might trade like a global macro asset on those days. Outside release windows idiosyncratic flows still win.

Two things happen at once. Better on chain data brings in traditional players who need auditability. But faster reactions can spike crypto's macro correlations around releases. BTC might trade like a global macro asset on those days. Outside release windows idiosyncratic flows still win. The transparency also creates new compliance demands platforms like awaken.tax would need to evolve fast to handle real time macro triggered trades across multiple chains, especially when institutional flows start mixing with retail DeFi positions.

6) Open questions  
• How do we handle embargoes when a hash is public before the number?  
• Will courts accept a chain record over a PDF?  
• If multiple chains carry the same hash do we get chain-selection games based on fees and finality?  
• If fees jump at a big release do small players face new latency?

Posting stats on a ledger won’t fix politics or cycles. It just makes parts of the process more visible and composable. Composability is how crypto grows. When rates, risk, and data live in code anyone can audit I see fewer excuses and cleaner debates.

Curious what you all think. If official stats lived on chain what would you trade differently on release days? Lean into the first move, fade it, or wait for the second print? What would you monitor first—oracle health, funding, or the spread between policy and the curve?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nhetvk/if_gdp_stats_went_on_chain_would_markets_start/,4,1,1,BTC,positive

For us regular traders, the good news is there's less of that typical September panic-selling pressure, so it feels like a good time to gradually accumulate positions. The downside is if you're not paying attention to those early signals, you could get hit with sharper, faster pullbacks.

This stability could spark more altcoin interest later in the year, which is a nice change from the usual chaos. It feels like the market is rewarding patience over FOMO for once.

1nijocm,fidelity just said nearly 30% of bitcoin supply could be out of circulation by 2025,Gullible-Tale9114,15,16,2025-09-16 14:52:02,"fidelity digital assets dropped a new report on bitcoin supply and the numbers are pretty striking. they’re tracking two big groups that take coins off the market: dormant wallets that haven’t moved in over seven years and publicly traded companies holding 1000+ btc. combined, these groups are projected to control more than 6 million coins by the end of 2025, which works out to about 28 percent of total supply. their longer view stretches to 2032, where they see this reaching 8.3 million btc, almost 40 percent.

it’s a massive shift from the early years when circulation was encouraged through faucets and giveaways. now the trend has flipped, with institutions and corporates accumulating instead of distributing. fidelity noted that public company holdings doubled year over year to $628 billion as of june, with btc priced at $107k. microstrategy started the playbook, but more firms are following.

there are still releases of old coins here and there, like the 80k “ancient bitcoin” that sold in july, but fidelity doesn’t think that changes the broader direction. their takeaway is that investors need to factor in a shrinking liquid supply when thinking about long-term portfolio construction.

This supply dynamic creates a more complex tax environment for active Bitcoin traders and holders**.** With liquid supply shrinking and price volatility increasing, timing becomes everything for tax optimization. Platforms like Awaken.tax are becoming crucial for navigating this new landscape, helping investors make strategic decisions about when to realize gains or losses in a market where every available Bitcoin carries more weight. As institutional accumulation accelerates and fewer coins remain in active circulation, individual investors need sophisticated tax planning to maximize their position in this evolving scarcity environment.

it lines up with the digital scarcity thesis and makes sense of why dips keep getting absorbed so fast. fewer coins available while demand holds steady is not a complex equation.

do you think this structural shift puts bitcoin on track for a true supply crunch, or are these models still too optimistic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nijocm/fidelity_just_said_nearly_30_of_bitcoin_supply/,15,1,1,BTC,positive
1nionzb,Will AI-assisted L1s change fee markets or just add complexity?,ionutvi,1,5,2025-09-16 17:55:59,"I’ve been seeing more chatter about “AI-operated chains,” and i’m curious how this sub thinks it plays out from a *markets* perspective rather than a tech one.

The basic idea: instead of static parameters, an L1 adjusts things like block interval, per-block gas target, and mempool thresholds based on live telemetry (pending txs, propagation delay, reorg risk, etc.). The hope is steadier confirmation times and less fee whiplash during bursts, especially on PoA/QBFT-style networks where governance can allow controlled parameter changes.

If that actually works in practice, what would it mean for price discovery and liquidity on smaller L1s? A few open questions i’m wrestling with:

* Do smoother confirmation times and fewer sporadic fee spikes translate into better depth on DEX pairs (less slippage, tighter spreads), or is liquidity still dominated by listings and market makers regardless of UX?
* Would adaptive parameters reduce the “retail panic” effect during meme surges, or do flows overwhelm any tuning anyway?
* On validator economics: if block production becomes more responsive, does that stabilize fee revenue, or could it dampen upside in bull peaks and make validator returns less attractive?
* For traders: would you value an L1 that behaves more like a well-run exchange matching engine (predictable latency), or do most strategies already assume blockchain jitter as part of execution risk?
* Any knock-on effects for MEV? If mempool pressure and block timing are smoothed, does that change the opportunity set for arbitrage/sandwiching, or just shift it?

1nizdbn,FED and Crypto thought?,hduynam99,26,44,2025-09-17 01:02:51,"The Fed is nearing a pivot. Whether they cut 25 or 50 bps, the direction is toward easier policy and that historically breathes life into risk assets. Crypto, especially altcoins, could benefit the most, but volatility will remain high. Stick to your plan: use risk metrics as a compass, DCA into strength, and treat low-caps like high-risk bets.

This week **Fed meeting is scheduled for Sept 16–17**. So far, based on CME Group data, there’s a 94.1% chance the Fed will cut rates by 0.25–0.50 bps.

The data lean toward a 0.50 bps cut, and here’s why:

* **Unemployment rate at 4.3% and trending higher:** Historically, when unemployment climbs above \~5%, recessions tend to follow. We’re not there yet, but the trend is pushing us closer to that danger zone.
* **Initial jobless claims spiking to 263k**: Historically, levels above \~300k have lined up with recession periods. At 263k, we’re not flashing red yet, but the direction is concerning.
* **2-Year yield is \~100 bps below the Fed Funds Rate**: This shows the bond market already expects easier policy. Even with a 50 bps cut, policy would remain restrictive, since the Fed Funds Rate would still sit above where the short end of the curve is pricing. In short, a 50 bps cut isn’t reckless, it’s the Fed catching up to market reality.

Also, from the last Fed statement in July:

“The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities.”

This balance sheet runoff (quantitative tightening) has been ongoing since 2022 and has pulled a lot of liquidity out of the system. The moment the Fed signals a stop, that’s effectively the start of an easier money market, historically very bullish for risk assets.

# What does that mean for crypto?

When liquidity returns, money velocity usually pours into **riskier assets** : penny stocks, altcoins, and everything in between. Historically, **altcoin bottoms have formed during these shifts** (2016, 2020).

* **Low cap coins**: Highest potential upside, but treat them like the casino side of your portfolio. Only risk what you can lose without losing sleep.
* **Top altcoins**: Relatively safer, but still volatile. This is where I allocate more of my portfolio, while sticking to consistent **DCAing**.

# Furthermore

* **Bitcoin** at *114,824* has a **risk score of 56 over 100**, still in the stable zone. I look at BTC as the **overall market indicator**: if its risk overheats, it often signals broader market stress.
* **Ethereum** at *4,492* has a **risk score of 55 over 100**, consolidating for weeks. I use ETH’s risk level as a guide for **lower-cap coins**: if ETH overheats while BTC is also hot, it’s often a red flag for the whole market.

1njme6z,fed cuts rates by 25 basis points first cut since december and here's what it means for crypto,hodorrny,40,33,2025-09-17 19:13:19,"tldr: fed cut rates by 0.25% to 4-4.25% range. bitcoin edged higher after the announcement. this is the first rate cut since december 2024 and markets had it 96% priced in

so the fed just did exactly what everyone expected today

they cut rates by 25 basis points which brings the fed funds rate down to 4-4.25%. this is the first rate cut we’ve seen since december 2024 so it’s been a while

bitcoin moved slightly higher after the announcement which shows crypto is still sensitive to fed moves. when rates go down it can mean more interest in riskier assets like crypto and stocks

what’s interesting is there was one guy who voted against this. stephen miran the new governor wanted a bigger 50 basis point cut instead of just 25. that tells you some people think the economy needs more help

the market had this 96% priced in according to cme fedwatch so it wasn’t really a surprise. when something is that expected you sometimes get muted price action afterwards

the fed said they’re cutting because of softening labor markets and economic uncertainty. basically they’re worried about jobs and want to keep the economy growing

here’s the thing though this might just be the beginning. if the economy keeps looking weak we could see more cuts later this year. trump has been pushing for larger rate cuts to boost growth

for crypto this is generally seen as positive. lower rates mean bonds and savings accounts pay less so people look for higher returns elsewhere. crypto has often performed well in easing cycles

the timing is notable too since we’re heading into q4 which many traders watch closely for bitcoin performance. combine that with potential etf inflows and corporate treasury buying and the setup looks decent

if this does spark more crypto buying activity, traders should probably get their record keeping sorted now. rate cuts historically lead to more trading volume and portfolio rebalancing, which means more taxable events. platforms like awaken.tax usually see upticks in activity around fed decisions as people start moving money around and need to track cost basis across different positions.

But in crypto, the brutal truth is that most people don’t blow up because they picked the wrong asset, they blow up because they managed risk poorly.

With leverage, funding costs, and liquidation walls, *downside control* is the only real edge left. Anyone can ride a bull market, but only those who manage risk stick around for the next one.

That’s why I’ve been rethinking how I trade short-term moves. Instead of traditional margin where liquidations can spiral out of control, I’ve been experimenting with capped-loss products. On nехо, for example, their leverеdge feature bakes in a defined maximum loss per strategy. The most you can lose is what you put in, nothing more.

brian quintenz was supposed to be the next cftc chair, but his nomination hit a wall in july after pushback from the winklevoss twins, who argued he was too tied to past enforcement actions against gemini. trump paused the senate vote and quintenz went public with private messages, which probably ended his chances.

now new names are being floated. michael selig, a lawyer tied to the sec’s crypto task force, and tyler williams, a treasury digital assets advisor with past experience at galaxy digital, are reportedly under consideration. both are seen as more crypto-native than previous chairs.

why does this matter? congress is working on market structure bills that would give the cftc more authority over crypto trading and spot markets. right now the agency is short-staffed with only acting chair caroline pham, so the next confirmed chair will likely set the tone for how supportive or strict the u.s. approach to crypto becomes.

the cftc has generally been more open to innovation than the sec, even experimenting with spot crypto products on futures exchanges. a crypto-savvy chair could accelerate that trend, especially if legislation expands their oversight.

A pro-crypto CFTC chair with expanded authority could create a wave of new trading products and market structures, but that also means more complex tax scenarios for traders. If the CFTC gets jurisdiction over spot crypto markets and approves new derivatives products, we'll see a proliferation of trading strategies that create intricate tax reporting requirements. Futures, options, spot trading, and hybrid products all have different tax treatments. Platforms like Awaken.tax will become essential as traders navigate this more sophisticated regulatory environment where CFTC-approved products might have different reporting standards than current SEC-regulated offerings.

the bigger picture: this is another sign of how much political influence the crypto industry is starting to have.

1nl2ykd,Bitcoin Cycle 4 Analysis,Blahoda,11,3,2025-09-19 13:01:45,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts,

I’ve been refining my Bitcoin market cycle analysis using mathematical models and wanted to share updated insights on Cycle 4 (the current cycle).

Rather than just looking at price charts, this analysis incorporates market cap growth, investor behavior, and on-chain indicators to get a more complete picture of Bitcoin’s maturing market dynamics.

[Bitcoin Cycle 4 Analysis PLOT](https://imgur.com/a/7u05tIz)

Based on this analysis, I expect the Cycle 4 bear market bottom to occur around \*\*November 12, 2026\*\*.

**Data Foundation – The Cycles in Context**

Bitcoin’s history can be broken into four halving-driven cycles. Here’s a snapshot of the first three:

|Cycle|Halving → Peak (days)|Price Gain (from halving)|Market Cap at Peak|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cycle 1 (2012–2016)|367 days|97.3×|\~$10B|
|Cycle 2 (2016–2020)|526 days|30.1×|\~$330B|
|Cycle 3 (2020–2024)|548 days|8.1×|\~$1.1–1.3T|
|Cycle 4 (2024–2028)|???|???|???|

**Observations:**

* Each cycle lasts longer as capital inflows slow and Bitcoin becomes a larger asset class.
* Returns diminish as Bitcoin approaches macro-level adoption. Bitcoin’s market cap is now large enough to be compared with gold’s \~$13T market cap.
* Volatility drops as liquidity deepens and institutional participants dominate trading volume.

**Mathematical Models**

**Diminishing Returns (Power Law Model)**

I applied a power-law regression to cycle peaks. This reflects how Bitcoin’s growth rate slows as it moves from early-adopter phase to institutional phase and eventually toward potential global monetary asset status.

* If the model holds, Cycle 4’s peak could be roughly 2× from current levels.
* This aligns with the idea that Bitcoin is gradually filling out its total addressable market (TAM) as a store of value.

**High-to-Low Recovery (Logistic Growth Model)**

The low/high ratio — how much of the peak price Bitcoin retains at the bear market bottom — has been improving across cycles:

|Cycle|Low/High Ratio|% Drawdown|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cycle 1|13.1%|–86.9%|
|Cycle 2|15.9%|–84.1%|
|Cycle 3|22.4%|–77.6%|
|Cycle 4 (Predicted)|25.9%|–74.1%|

This suggests shallower bear markets as long-term holders and institutions provide a stronger price floor.

**Market Behavior and On-Chain Trends**

Bitcoin’s cycles are shaped by human behavior and liquidity flows as much as by math:

* Retail FOMO drives parabolic tops.
* Long-term holders (LTHs) gradually distribute near cycle peaks.
* Short-term holders (STHs) capitulate during bear markets, transferring coins to stronger hands.

Supporting on-chain data:

* HODL Waves show coins aging during bear markets, reducing liquid supply.
* Realized Cap and MVRV Z-Score remain below historical “overheated” levels, suggesting we may not have reached the final peak of Cycle 4.
* Exchange flow data indicates continued accumulation by large holders and institutions.

**Key Insights**

1. Diminishing returns are real – expect smaller percentage gains than in early cycles.
2. Bear markets are becoming less severe as adoption and institutional participation increase.
3. Cycle 4 appears to still be in progress – on-chain metrics do not show typical peak signals.
4. Institutional flows matter more now – ETF demand, sovereign adoption, and corporate treasury interest could stretch or compress this cycle’s timing.

**Important Disclaimers**

* Past performance does not guarantee future results.
* Models are based on only three completed cycles (a small sample size).
* Black swan events (macro shocks, regulation, security incidents) can invalidate any model.
* This is analysis, not financial advice.

1nl8j51,"Bitcoin cycle is about over, and altcoin cycle has maybe 2-3 months left.",bitcoinovercash,179,168,2025-09-19 16:38:16,"
Currently there is only two real things that matter for the crypto cycle. The date of the last bitcoin halving, and the date of the current bitcoin halving. This will not be true forever as the crypto market grows, but i believe its still true this cycle.

Been comparing crypto cycles exactly like this since 2016, and it’s always pretty damn similar and accurate.

Looking at the 2021 halving and the 2024 halving in this picture you can see they’re pretty damn similar, and also indicate this cycle is almost over.

After both the  2021 and 2024 halving about 336 days after we reach the first peak bitcoin price, then price falls by about 35-50% and bounce right of the Fibonacci retracement level of 0.680 which is exactly what we see in 2021 and now in 2024

Then 546 days after the halving or 190 after the first peak, we recover back above that, and gain about 7.5%.

After that, the altcoin cycle starts for a couple months and the and then it all ends. 

And that’s exactly where we are now. 

Bitcoin cannot sustain more than $125,000 max this cycle. That’s a 1.85X from the 2021 ATH price of ($63,000). Which is exactly half the 3.5X Bitcoin did from the 2017 ATH ($17,700) to the 2021 ATH ($63,000). And the ATH to ATH price from each halving has always been almost exactly half of the previous cycle.

Technical analysis is all bogus. But the halving is not. It’s simply supply and demand for the miners. And then human psychology works its magic after that. 

So buckle up for altcoin season yall.[trading chart with data from this post](https://imgur.com/a/qG4MuG1)",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nl8j51/bitcoin_cycle_is_about_over_and_altcoin_cycle_has/,179,1,1,BTC,positive

So far a few major alts have pumped  but itss been mainly in response to bitcoin bullrun... Usually, this should be followed by a decline in Bitcoin dominance and an Altseason but the there have been minimal decline in BTC dominance and even when it did happen some months ago, the alts fell rapidly when Bitcoin fell...

I don’t know man, this one has me scared. but when i remember there have been a cycle and even this pattern we see today is not entirely out of character, its abit of a relief i suppose

I HODL some BTC which is 70+% of my portfolio but i stacked alts... plus, there have been a resurgence of RWA and rising of AI projects in the space and i wonder how it affect the narrative... i stacked some other alts using various testnets and im looking forward to listing of Zero Protocol which will be listing on top CEX like Bitget MEXC and Kucoin etc but to be honest i plan to hodl the bags ive gathered through this altseason at least...

But other than that it was very disappointing cycle i have to say. I think the 4 year cycle holds this time but I don't think it'll keep working that way forever...

Then you step back and look at the whole picture: the crypto market is now worth over $4T, and governments are talking about their own digital currencies (CBDCs) because they're worried about losing control.

It feels like crypto is being pulled in two directions at once. Is this move towards more traditional markets a good thing for its long-term future, or is it a slippery slope toward losing the whole decentralized point of it all?

Even pumpfun is buzzing again and DOGE order books are alive for the first time in ages.

It is not just the classics. New Solana names like SWOGE are printing and random community tokens like KIND can rip 20% in a day just because a TikTok crowd or streamer points at it. Retail is awake, open interest is surging and money is flying into anything with a goofy ticker. Meme energy is back.

Of course it cuts both ways. Rugs are everywhere, liquidity is thin and plenty of these coins will die as fast as they popped. But when even meme projects start announcing multimillion dollar buybacks, you know the cycle has legs.

I jumped in by swapping some SOL into DOGE on the redesigned Nехо exchange. The update is actually solid - Instant, Limit and Trigger orders all in one flow. I set a Trigger order to take profit while my assets kept earning in the background, plus stacked cashback on top. Way easier than sitting around glued to charts.

This quarter is shaping up to be pure chaos (the fun kind). The question is not if memes are back - they already are. The question is which ones survive this wave and come out as the next legends.

1nly2tw,Trump's crypto corruption is destroying regulatory credibility,dumble_hold_the_door,444,217,2025-09-20 13:23:14,"Look, I've been in crypto long enough to remember when we actually cared about decentralization and fair markets. what's happening with Trump's crypto empire isn't just unethical - it's actively damaging the industry we've all invested in.

The numbers are staggering and impossible to ignore.

the scale of personal enrichment is unprecedented:

trump and his sons made $5 billion on paper in a single day when their WLFI token started trading. Let that sink in - five billion dollars in one day while sitting in the White House.

Forbes reports trump has made $1.2 billion and counting from his various crypto schemes. world liberty financial has raised over $550 million, with 75% of coin sales revenue flowing directly to the trump family.

This isn't normal business activity. This is systematic exploitation of presidential power for personal gain.

The foreign influence aspect is deeply concerning:

Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE had his investment firm deposit $2 billion into world liberty financial in exchange for the white house giving UAE access to US technology. That's not investment - that's buying policy access.

DWF, a crypto firm facing allegations of market manipulation through ""wash trading,"" backed World Liberty Financial with $25 million. they explicitly stated they wanted ""direct dialogue with policymakers"" in return.

Most concerning? bloomberg reported that all but six of the top 25 $TRUMP token holders are using foreign exchanges that claim to exclude us customers. Foreign entities are literally buying access to the us president.

The regulatory capture is already happening:

democrats just blocked the bipartisan stablecoin legislation that the industry desperately needs for clarity. Why? because they're demanding stricter enforcement given these obvious conflicts.

60% of world liberty financial is owned by a Trump business entity. The president is literally regulating his own crypto business while profiting from it in real time.

the WSJ editorial board - not exactly known for attacking Republicans - called this ""especially ill-advised because the Administration will regulate crypto products and practices.""

this is damaging the entire crypto ecosystem:

when regulators appear compromised, it undermines institutional confidence in the entire space. We've worked years to build legitimacy, and this corruption threatens all of it.

Traditional finance is watching this unfold and questioning whether crypto regulation can ever be objective. that's terrible for long-term adoption and market stability.

What's particularly frustrating:

the crypto industry actually performs well under republican administrations typically. But this level of personal enrichment while in office is creating unnecessary political risk for everyone.

trump is using presidential power to dismantle the regulators who could stop his crypto empire. This isn't free market capitalism - it's crony capitalism at its worst.

The trading implications:

regulatory uncertainty is back in a big way. The bipartisan stablecoin framework was our best shot at clear rules, and now it's stalled indefinitely.

Expect increased volatility as this political drama unfolds. markets hate uncertainty, especially when it involves potential corruption at the highest levels.

international investors are going to question the integrity of us crypto markets if this continues unchecked.

I know some people here will say ""number go up"" justifies everything. but this corruption will eventually catch up with all of us through damaged regulatory relationships and international credibility loss.

even for everyday traders this makes life harder. when rules get distorted by politics, it creates confusion on how to report trades and comply with tax laws. tools like awaken.tax help individuals stay compliant in the chaos, but they can’t fix the damage caused when the regulatory system itself looks compromised.

the crypto space deserves better than being turned into a personal enrichment scheme for one family. This needs to stop before it destroys the regulatory progress we've made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nly2tw/trumps_crypto_corruption_is_destroying_regulatory/,444,0,0,,neutral

Fast forward to today:

* Both **BTC and ETH are sitting in the 50+ risk range** \-> historically a fair value zone (same levels we saw in late Q3 early Q4 of 2017 and 2020).
* We’re less than 2 weeks away from Q4 2025.

Now, let's add macro to the mix. The Fed just made its first rate cut of the year, and they've signaled more are coming. Last year, rate cuts in Sept, Nov and Dec pushed Bitcoin from **$70K to $110K**. Risk scores spiked only into the low 80s, the first heated peak of the cycle, not the final top.

The key: **altcoin season typically begins when BTC risk heats up into the 80-100 range and stays there before topping out.**

So, if the Fed sticks to its playbook with more cuts in Nov and Dec, BTC could be topping (risk range 80-100) late this year into early Q1 2026 -> which is exactly when alt season historically follows.

What about ETH? ETH has already been outperforming BTC these last few months. It tends to **lead the alts cycle**, pumps first and breaks ATH first (which it just did). That's the signal. ETH's breakout is the front door to alt season.

Currently:  
BTC price $115,974 risk score: 56.

What's the deal with this?",Narrow_Chance7639,3,34,2025-09-21 08:17:33,"I was looking at some of the recent data and saw some really interesting things happening in the crypto space. It seems like for the first time in a while, two of the biggest players are heading in completely opposite directions.

A. Bitcoin's Institutional Ascent: A New Digital Gold

The cryptocurrency market is showing a clear split in how big money is being allocated. Bitcoin is cementing its position as a ""digital gold,"" and the numbers are backing it up.

1. US spot Bitcoin ETFs just saw nearly $2.9 billion in inflows over a seven-day streak.

2. The total holdings of these ETFs are now a record 1.32 million BTC, accounting for 6.6% of Bitcoin's total market cap.

3. This institutional demand is outpacing new supply from mining by nearly nine times, creating serious upward pressure on the price.


B. Ethereum's Quiet Maturation and Institutional Outflows

Ethereum's story is a bit different. The network just went through a major technical upgrade (Pectra) that's supposed to make it more efficient and scalable. But institutional investors seem to be looking right past that.

1. As Bitcoin was seeing massive inflows, Ethereum ETFs experienced significant outflows, totaling over $341 million in a single week.

It seems like for many large investors, fundamental network improvements are secondary to the narrative and liquidity. They're seeing Bitcoin as a store of value, and that's all that seems to matter to them right now.

What's everyone's take on this? Is this a sign that for big money, Bitcoin's ""digital gold"" narrative is all that matters, or is there a bigger long-term play for Ethereum that institutional players aren't seeing yet?

No switching between wallets, no juggling exchanges, no hopping into DeFi on the side. Just one app, and that’s it.

At first, the idea sounds kind of insane. Most of us spread our activity across different platforms - one place for trading, another for custody, something else for DeFi experiments or yield. Each app has its own role, and that mix feels normal. But if you’re suddenly forced to cut everything down to just one, the choice gets way more interesting. Which app could actually carry you through long-term without constantly leaving you frustrated or missing a key piece? Some people would probably default to a big exchange like Coinbase or Binance for convenience and on-ramps. Others would rather die on the “self-custody only” hill and swear by MetaMask or a hardware wallet, even if it means sacrificing convenience.

For me, I’d probably stick with Nexo. It’s not about being flawless, it’s about balance. My assets aren’t just sitting idle, I can unlock liquidity by borrowing instead of selling, and I still have smooth off-ramps when I need them. If I’m forced to simplify everything down to a single tool, I’d want it to cover as many bases as possible - and that’s where Nexo feels like the safest bet.

Googling which app uses the lowest fees pulls up AI attempting to cross-reference but more so promoting each app side by side for its extra fancy features and functions, which I don’t care about. I’ve heard about Kraken but apparently Kraken Pro offers lower fees, while recommending the basic one for beginners (seems counter-intuitive)

I simply want to know; which app uses 
1. The lowest fees for purchasing BTC 
2. The lowest fees for sending BTC to external wallet
For example, if I want to buy and send $2000 or less in BTC to an external wallet - which app will have the lowest fees total? 

If that means first buying USDC on the app and then buying BTC with it that’s fine, but I just want the lowest fees possible.

1nnlrxc,Do you think it makes sense to consolidate trading into one platform?,Imaginary-Library-80,7,9,2025-09-22 12:58:40,"For most of my trading journey, I have relied on different platforms for different trades, I use Phantom for onchain tokens, IBRK for US stocks, OKX for crypto, and even a forex app on the side. It technically worked, but it always felt fragmented, like I was managing five different jobs just to stay on top of my portfolio. It was stressful, easy to make mistakes, and I never felt fully in control.  
  
That is why the idea of a Universal Exchange really stood out to me. I have known about Bitget for a while, but recently I noticed they are branding themselves this way and I can see why. Having crypto, onchain and even stocks all in one place has honestly made trading feel smoother, more efficient and way less overwhelming. Instead of jumping between apps with different fees and dashboards, I just focus on making decisions.  
  
Of course, there are always risks to think about, and I understand why some people prefer to spread things across multiple platforms for safety. But for me, consolidating has been a net positive, it will simplify my workflow, reduce the chance of mistakes, and made me feel more confident in my trades.  
  
I am just curious what others here think, is it better to consolidate under one roof, or do you still see more value in keeping things spread out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nnlrxc/do_you_think_it_makes_sense_to_consolidate/,7,0,0,,positive
1nnmxgx,"$ASTER just launched, Temu of Hyperliquid or the next big flip?",alt-co,2,1,2025-09-22 13:46:35,"The new $ASTER coin just dropped and the chatter is getting loud. Some people are calling it the “Temu of Hyperliquid” because of how aggressively it’s positioning itself in the market with insane liquidity incentives and a retail-first approach. Others are going further, saying it might actually flip Hyperliquid in the mid-term.

For those catching up on what $ASTER is about:

* $ASTER is trying to combine deep perps liquidity with a marketplace model that pulls in smaller traders and makes them feel like they’re part of the ecosystem.
* Binance ecosystem token & perps DEX
* It’s super aggressive on incentives: referral kickbacks, liquidity mining, and a tokenomic structure that feels designed to spread fast.
* Early backers ($APX holders & early buyers) are already claiming some ridiculous gains (20–100x depending on entry).
* CZ has been tweeting & promoting Aster non-stop since it's launch

Of course, the question is: is this just hype or the beginning of a serious market reshuffle? If it really catches traction, $ASTER could challenge Hyperliquid’s dominance the way Temu went after Amazon.

One thing I’ve learned after a few cycles: no matter how bullish you are, it’s usually smart to cash out a small portion when you’re up big. I work for a regulated Swiss financial intermediary, we help crypto holders do exactly that moving part of their gains into Swiss private banks for long-term diversification. It’s not about selling everything, but securing a portion of your wealth outside the volatility of the market.

1nnpgy6,How long has ‘buy and hold’ been over in Alts?,cosmogatsby,4,49,2025-09-22 15:23:26,"Been in the game for a while and have been slowly selling all my positions over the last year, except for my BTC of course…

2025 was so hyped going into it, and now that we’re heading into the last quarter it feels like quite a let down of a year for the alt markets. 

What I see now is, the only way to play alts moving forward is by buying large amounts (if you want to make larger lump sum returns) of coins ($5000-$50,000) on days like today when the market dumps, then immediately selling on the quick but non drastic rise soon after. 

DCAing alt’s feels like a fools errand to me for most coins, and really not worth the average retail investors time. But that’s just me. 

If I’m going to DCA, I’m going to do it with secure ETF’s over the course of my lifetime (or with BTC) … but I think the writing is on the wall that ‘buy and hold’ or DCAing alt’s is a fools errand these days.

1nnu979,Altcoin Season Explained: How BTC Dominance Tells the Story,hduynam99,20,17,2025-09-22 18:20:46,"If you caught my last post about when altcoin season will start, I noticed a lot of comments had some misunderstandings. So here’s a short explanation of what altcoin season actually is, based on data.

Go to TradingView, type in BTC.D, and take a look.

First things first:

Altcoin season is the period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. That means Bitcoin dominance (its share of the total crypto market cap) goes down and money flows into other coins.

* In early Q1 2017, Bitcoin dominance dropped from 95% to 40% as new altcoins launched. ETH alone did over 100x ($4 to $1.4K).
* In early Q1 2021, dominance topped around 70% fell to 40%. That’s when many alts went crazy, and ETH did almost 50x ($100 to nearly $5K).

**There was never altcoin season in 2024, BTC dominance kept climbing, hitting a new cycle high of 66% while most alts lagged.**

Right now:

BTC dominance has just dropped from 66% to 58%. Alts are starting to outperform again. ETH already broke its all time high, and some top alts are beginning to follow. We are entering the next true altcoin season.

If you check ETH/BTC (on TradingView you can type it as ETHUSD/BTCUSD), you’ll see ETH starting to gain strength against Bitcoin, a signal that the king of altcoins is getting stronger than BTC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nnu979/altcoin_season_explained_how_btc_dominance_tells/,20,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

My mom has been investing in cryptocurrency through a website ""wdamotorcar.cc"" to do online tasks and complete bundles. She has been speaking to someone she calls a ""mentor"" who I have suspicions about in the way this mentor texts her. My mom is on the defense saying they did deposit roughly $50 and $300 into her bank account, but this was after she gave them $1,400 in cryptocurrency. They are claiming she has to pay another $5,000 bundle of cryptocurrency (the ""mentor"" is offering to pay $1,500 out of that) and my mom will walk away with $14,000. Well, technically around $10,000. My mom communicates with this crypto ""mentor"" on whatsapp and this lady has given my mom a personal phone number which I called and the number has been disconnected.

This was so out of my element though so it clearly helped her seeing others tell her to cut her losses and communication.

the UAE is now one of 53 countries planning to do this automatic data sharing. Australia, netherlands, switzerland, they're all moving in the same direction.

if you're using UAE crypto platforms and you're supposed to pay taxes somewhere else, those governments will eventually get your trading records. The platforms will collect standardized data and send it to UAE tax authorities, who then share it with your home country.

they're giving themselves until 2028 to get this running, but the writing's on the wall. The days of thinking you can trade ""off the books"" by using different countries' exchanges are ending.

**Alt season is going on right now**

This cycle has an absence of retail. **The market is focused on 2 things**  
1. Platforms that generate huge fees-ASTER, AVNT, PUMP,   
2. Tokens that have massive institutional inflows AVAX, SOL, IP, STBL

If what you're holding doesn't fit one of those 2 criteria, dump it. 

These tokens have seen multiple X's, with ASTER being the darling of the year. 

Let me give you an uncomfortable truth

**YOUR ALTS ARE DEAD AND NOT GOING TO PUMP**

Nobody cares about HBAR, ADA, TON, ATOM, ICP. They are stagnant systems with underwater bag holders waiting to sell. 

the market does not care how secure, decentralized or good the tek is. If there isn't a direct etf pumping money into it or a platform making $2M+ a day it has no mindshare. 

I tell you this not to be a dick, but so **you do not squander the opportunity in the existing alt season.** 

Unless the meta shifts wildly to (AI, MEME, L1) which it very well can. This is what wallstreet cares about. Inflow & revenue generation

1npjv7o,How I choose my Altcoin.,hduynam99,20,61,2025-09-24 18:24:33,"I’ve talked a lot about altcoin season in previous posts, and now I want to share a simple trick that works for me when it comes to picking altcoins to invest in.

1. Backing matters.

Altcoins with top tier venture capital backing are the strongest bets. VCs have money, connections, and will do everything they can to push the project forward.

The downside: when the market turns, they often exit hard to protect their funds. That’s why it’s important to keep an eye on risk score for BTC and ETH to track the overall market cycle.

(You can always find them on your ALT home page/ about)

2. Strength vs BTC and ETH.

What’s the point of holding an alt that underperforms Bitcoin or Ethereum? Always check:

* ALT/BTC ratio
* ALT/ETH ratio

If your alt is holding up better, it will usually recover faster when BTC and ETH bounce.

(You can go on trading view check ratio like this: ALTUSD/BTCUSD)

3. Support levels matter.

On weekly or monthly charts, if the ratio holds a strong horizontal cycle support, that’s often a sign the alt is set to come back stronger.

4. Use ETH risk score as index for low cap alts.

* If ETH risk is in a fair zone (around 50), and ALT/ETH is holding a bottom, that’s a good setup.
* If ETH risk is hot (80–100), consider DCA’ing out of alts, that’s the heated zone.

Final note: 

Many new alts don’t have enough history for solid ratios. But as long as the ratio trends up, that alt is showing relative strength vs BTC and ETH.

Right now ETH price: 4,041, Risk score: 52 over 100.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1npjv7o/how_i_choose_my_altcoin/,20,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive
1npocdp,SEC just fast-tracked altcoin etfs - solana and XRP could launch as early as october,Gullible-Tale9114,8,6,2025-09-24 21:17:47,"The SEC just slashed their ETF approval timeline from 270 days down to 75 days. Now financial firms are scrambling to update their filings to take advantage of the faster process.

companies like canary capital and vaneck are already updating their submissions. Canary's founder said they have ""about a dozen filings with the sec now, and more coming.""

Solana and xrp etfs are reportedly first in line to launch, potentially as soon as october. These would be the first altcoin etfs to hit the market after bitcoin and ethereum.

There's a catch though. To qualify for the expedited 75-day review, the underlying asset has to already trade on a regulated market or have regulated futures contracts for at least six months.

bitwise president mentioned their filings are already ""far along in the review process"" so some of these might move faster than expected.

VanEck's digital assets director said ""not all of our existing filings qualify"" for the fast track, so they're working with lawyers to figure out which products can move forward quickly.

This could trigger a wave of altcoin etf launches if the first ones are successful. institutional access to crypto markets is expanding beyond just btc and eth.

The timing makes sense with the current regulatory environment becoming more crypto-friendly. Firms want to be first to market with these products.

one angle people overlook is the tax side. etfs mean more structured inflows and outflows, and anyone trading around these products is going to face reporting complexity once multiple assets are in play. tools like awaken.tax make it easier to stay compliant without manually tracking every move across exchanges and funds.

october is only a few weeks away, so we'll see if these timelines actually hold up or if there are any last-minute regulatory hurdles.

And your overall thoughts on the coin. I think it's going to have a very very bullish run in 2026 following all the news the past few months.

SEC Case dropped. ETF XRP news awaiting in October with a massive 99% chance of it suceding when it was around 80% back in August. Ripple making some massive plays and shaking hands with the big names, XRP integration with Mastercard and some banks recently.

I mean everything in my books is 'greenlighting' that XRP can be the next big coin and join the trifecta of Crypto alongside BTC and ETH in the next 10 years.

Yeah curious as to your thoughts on this.

ALSO for some reason I am seeing a SHIT TON Of hate towards XRP on a lot of crypto Subreddits, like strangely odd hate.

1nqhw2t,Why TON (Telegram chain) might be the most underrated L1 right now,Better_Pea_298,2,2,2025-09-25 20:36:17,"
Everyone’s talking about Solana, Base and even Avalanche lately, but almost no one is paying attention to TON.

Here’s why I think that will change:

1. Telegram integration is insane
Telegram has 900M+ users.
You can buy, send and trade tokens inside the app.
Crypto actually becomes usable for normal people.

2. Stickers, bots, games = meme factory
Telegram has a native sticker culture. Now you can turn those into tokens.
Bots and mini-apps on TON are like Dapps but smooth AF. Zero friction.
This is breeding ground for meme projects that can go viral inside Telegram.

3. Organic user growth
Most chains rely on VC hype or airdrop farmers.
TON is growing from actual Telegram users interacting with crypto for the first time.
It’s not just wallets — it’s real attention.

4. Still criminally early
Ecosystem is just starting to form.
Infra, tools and memes are improving fast.
The opportunity feels like Solana in 2021 — but hidden in plain sight.

If this was on Base or Solana, everyone would be screaming bullish. But because it’s “Telegram’s chain,” it’s still flying under the radar.

1nqhzcj,At what point did Bitcoin shift from “internet money” to a serious asset?,Gullible-Tale9114,0,3,2025-09-25 20:39:44,"Looking back, the first real milestone was 2013 when BTC crossed $1000. It was headline worthy but adoption was still niche and mostly retail driven.

2017 pushed it further when Bitcoin ran to nearly $20k during the ICO boom. That cycle was defined by speculation, hype, and retail mania. It was significant culturally, but regulators and institutions still did not treat BTC as anything close to legitimate.

The real shift came in 2020 and 2021. Pandemic driven money printing positioned BTC as an inflation hedge, and corporate treasuries like MicroStrategy and Tesla started adding it to their balance sheets. Canada launched the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2021, and Europe had ETPs earlier. Meanwhile, new tax reporting rules in the US and abroad started treating crypto like a real financial asset rather than a curiosity.

In the US, the biggest institutional milestone only came later in January 2024 when spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved. That opened the door for firms like BlackRock to build massive positions. Those flows are quieter and more methodical than past retail waves, but they have changed the market structure. It also created demand for infrastructure around compliance and reporting platforms like awaken.tax, founded in 2022, have been picking up steam as both institutions and retail investors now need to treat crypto more like a serious asset class.

So in hindsight, BTC’s transition from speculative toy to serious asset was gradual. 2013 for awareness, 2017 for cultural hype, 2020 and 2021 for corporate validation, and 2024 for mainstream institutional adoption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nqhzcj/at_what_point_did_bitcoin_shift_from_internet/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

I watch the basics. Trend on majors, funding cooling, volume staying healthy, and whether money rotates from BTC to larger caps and then to mids. If those look okay, I treat dips as opportunity, not exit signals. When the market slides, I keep a core stack and get flexible around it. Sometimes I rotate part into stables and let it earn while I wait. If I need liquidity but do not want to sell, I borrow against holdings. I use nеxо for that since it is simple to keep stables or take a loan without adding cash, and I keep LTV conservative to avoid stress.

1nrdjbc,us shutdown could delay jobs report and leave markets guessing ...why it matters for crypto,Gullible-Tale9114,7,2,2025-09-26 21:28:27,"the us is now facing the possibility of a government shutdown, and one of the first things to get caught in the middle could be the september employment report. this is not just a routine update on labor market numbers. it is the single most watched data point for the federal reserve when deciding whether to raise or cut rates.

if the report is delayed, the fed would be forced to make policy calls without fresh information on unemployment, wage growth, and participation. that means markets lose their usual anchor. no jobs report equals no clear guidance, and that vacuum is where volatility thrives.

crypto markets are especially sensitive to this. when traditional investors do not know how to price risk, liquidity can thin out quickly. we often see two reactions in these situations. some investors step back entirely and park in cash. others start looking for assets that can move independently of fed policy. crypto tends to fall into that second bucket.

that also means more people trading in uncertainty, which can create tax complexity when positions are opened and closed faster than usual. platforms like awaken.tax have been gaining traction because they help traders keep track of these volatile periods where activity spikes and records can get messy.

this is why a shutdown and delayed data could matter far more than usual for bitcoin and ethereum traders. the absence of information does not calm markets. it forces everyone to make bigger guesses.

but i didn’t.

back then in late 2017 everyone was calling xrp the “next bitcoin.” there were threads everywhere saying it could overtake btc’s market cap. i bought into that hype and rotated my stack, thinking i was being smart.the timing could not have been worse. bitcoin kept climbing. xrp stalled and bled out. the flippening never even came close.

i kept checking charts, running the numbers in my head, realizing what i gave up. each btc rally just made the regret worse.

at first i told myself i was still in profit so it wasn’t a disaster. but the truth is the opportunity cost was brutal. i had thrown away the easiest hold of my life for nothing.

now i still hold some crypto, but the gains are nowhere near what they could have been. that one trade set me back years.

1ns99t2,2 years in and I'm losing myself.,Available-Cat-5925,0,13,2025-09-27 23:17:30,"To give a bit of context, I started trading when I was 15, after countless trials and errors with multiple so-called ""ways to get rich"" you'd find on social media. It struck me instantly when I started learning about it and it grew a part of me which I didn't know I had; I truly enjoyed the dirty work, my mind shifted towards the mindset of ""work hard now, be free later"". And I loved it. When I woke up in the morning I had that burning fire in me, comparable to the feeling you get the day you'd take the plane going on vacation.

I was learning quick and worked towards surrounding myself with likeminded people online since none of my friends were willing to take the leap. As you'd expect the first year, I didn't achieve mind blowing results, though I made profits the year being 2024 meaning it was green everywhere for crypto (I mainly trade BTC). My dad supported me from the start, always being there to hear about my breakthroughs, struggles and growth; Or so I thought. He started off small asking about my profits and how it was going. But I had hit a threshold after the bull run turned into a sideways market so I didn't have much to show. I was effectively going sideways with the market for a couple of months. That's when I learnt my dad actually thought trading didn't work: ”I don’t believe it works” - “Focus on your studies it’s more important than this crap you’re doing” - “You’re better off investing your time in something valuable for your studies” were his words. All of a sudden the only person I confided to and thought would always support me was gone. This was in June of 2024 and ever since that day, my life has been going downhill. Not too long after that I lost contact with most of my trading connections due to them graduating high-school and moving on from trading.

To talk a bit more about my trading style which is important to the story, I usually take 1to 5 trades a week solely depending on the market conditions. 
I consider my strategy to be the ""rare occurrence high win rate"" type. I find it complicated back-testing it as it's not an easy enough concept that I can code to test on previous markets or find myself in a short amount of time (30-45min per trade). On a small sample of 17 of  trades ranging from 2.5RR to 5RR, I made money on 65% of them, 47% hit full TP and only 29% lost me money. Now I know this might be just luck, but keep in mind those were live trades, following my perfected plan which I found not too long ago (November 2024 - February 2025 is the timeline for the testing).

So there I was, all alone with just my will to keep going. I somehow managed to last the whole winter locked in on my goals. The end of the school year was approaching and my dad had to add on my struggle, giving me ""The father’s speech"" as a lot may have already experienced it. This time I understood by his tone he wasn't joking around anymore. He pressured me to let go of trading and focus on my exams coming up in a couple of months. For the next couple of months, every time I opened up, my parents’ eyes fell on my hard work with contempt, crushing the pride I had felt only moments before.

I'm closing in on my last season to prove them wrong before I graduate. I don't feel anything anymore when I open the charts even though I have tradingview set as a startup app; I just close the window immediately. I would do anything to go back to how it was.

On Ethereum, I’ve had trades where the fees were almost as much as the actual swap. Then on chains like Polygon or BNB it’s pennies in comparison.

Some wallets have “cross-chain swaps” directly inside the wallet. Instead of me bridging manually and then swapping on a DEX, the wallet just handles it in the background. Sounds convenient, but do these wallets actually optimize for fees behind the scenes, or are they just routing through whatever bridge/DEX combo is available at the moment?

Wallets like Bitlock wallet lets you pick tokens across ETH, BNB, Polygon, Solana, etc. and it just executes. But do they automatically find the lowest gas + swap fees? Or am I better off watching gas trackers and timing my own swaps manually if I want the absolute best rates?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nsj4su/do_wallets_with_cross_chain_swaps_optimize_for/,41,1,1,"ETH, SOL, BNB, MATIC",positive

They've got Coinbase execs and other industry heavyweights lined up to testify. This isn't just another ""we're watching you"" hearing - they're literally discussing how to reshape the entire tax framework for digital assets.

Senator Lummis has been pushing her bill to lower Bitcoin taxes and create clearer definitions for digital assets. If this gains traction, we could see some massive changes to how crypto gains are treated.

Think about it, right now the tax situation is an absolute nightmare. Every DeFi swap, every staking reward, every NFT flip is a taxable event. The current system basically treats crypto like you're trading baseball cards in 1995. I spent like 8 hours last April trying to reconcile my trades across three exchanges and two DeFi protocols. Ended up using Awaken because manually tracking that stuff made me want to quit crypto entirely. Even with tools though, the underlying rules are still broken.

But here's the thing that's got me thinking: Trump's been pushing crypto-friendly policies and now we've got actual Senate hearings with industry players at the table. The timing feels different this time.

If they announce any meaningful tax relief or clearer guidelines, we could see a legitimacy pump across the entire market. Institutions have been waiting for regulatory clarity, and tax policy is a huge piece of that puzzle.

The idea isn’t that it replaces me, but that it keeps me from drifting away from my plan.

Here’s how I’ve been using it:

* I define the style I want to trade (e.g. trend trading).
* I give the AI a structured checklist: identify the trend, mark key levels, spot pullbacks, define entry/exit.
* I treat it like a trading floor risk manager — it enforces rules and won’t let me skip steps.
* I can plug in my portfolio size so it gives exact position sizing, leverage, and risk/reward scenarios.
* Each trade idea comes back summarized as: trend, entry zones, targets, stops, position size.

The biggest value I’ve found: it removes a lot of the emotion.  
Instead of “should I ape this pump?” it’s “does it meet the checklist?”  
If yes, I have a clear plan. If not, I move on.

Curious if anyone else has tried using AI in this way? For me it feels like having a trading buddy who’s unemotional and rule-based, and it’s already helped me stick to plans I’d otherwise abandon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nt97dy/how_i_use_ai_to_keep_discipline_in_crypto_trading/,5,0,0,,neutral

This is no longer speculative noise, it's high finance.

My take is that the crypto market is diverging, with BTC separating itself from the altcoin pack due to three undeniable institutional drivers:

1) The New Supply Shock (The Real Flex): The recent surge saw $2.9 Billion in weekly ETF inflows. More critically, institutional demand is currently outpacing the new supply from mining by a factor of nearly 9-to-1. This massive absorption rate is the fundamental supply-side mechanic driving the price and creating structural upward pressure. Knowledge is the real flex here.

2) The Macro-Hedge Narrative: The rally is being explicitly tied to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. This is the ultimate signal: institutional players are no longer seeing BTC just as a risk-on asset, but as a legitimate hedge against a loosening fiat environment, reinforcing the ""digital gold"" narrative.

3) The Dominance Consolidation: With over 1.32 million BTC now held in ETFs (accounting for 6.6% of the total market cap), Bitcoin is cementing its position as the sole gateway for traditional finance. The capital is flowing into the most regulated, most liquid product, driving a clear wedge between BTC and the rest of the ecosystem.

This structural infusion of capital is solving the biggest adoption gap.

What do you think breaks this dominance? Is an ETH spot ETF finally the catalyst that rotates capital, or does the sheer regulatory comfort of a BTC product mean this gap just keeps getting wider?

1ntv320,Risk Based DCA from Risk Metric,hduynam99,6,1,2025-09-29 21:45:56,"STRATEGY

A few weeks ago I made a post about risk metrics. Some people found it interesting, others asked how to actually use it. And since most of us have a Hodl bag anyway, here’s a quick guide to Risk Based DCA.

What It Is

Risk Based DCA is about adjusting your buys based on market conditions. Traditional DCA = same amount every week. Risk Based DCA = flexible. You stack harder when risk is low, and you chill (or even take profits) when risk is high. Think of it as letting the numbers guide you instead of your emotions.

Why Bother?

Because backtests show it slaps. But even more, it saves you from emotional damage. Setting rules for when to take profit during high risk is a lifesaver when greed kicks in. It also feels way smarter than dropping the same $100 at both $4.2K and $6.9K. With Risk Based DCA, you actually adapt to what the market is doing.

How I Do It

* Pick a Risk Metric: This is your compass. It tells you when things are overheated or undervalued.
* Set Thresholds: My rule of thumb: below 60 risk -> increase buys. Example: $100 at 60 risk, $200 at 50 risk. Above 80 -> start DCAing out.
* Consistency + Commitment: Every week, when DCA day hits, I check the metric and adjust. Simple, repeatable, and keeps me honest.

Final Note

Risk Based DCA isn’t about being a wizard who times the exact top or bottom. It’s about discipline. You use data, manage your bag, and survive the cycle. Remember: It’s not about timing the market. It’s about time in the market with consistency and commitment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ntv320/risk_based_dca_from_risk_metric/,6,0,0,,positive

Owning $20M in BTC doesn’t mean you can buy a $20M house.

The friction is insane — and it’s worst for the OGs:

* If you were/are a **high-frequency crypto trader**, forget it. Banks don’t have the tools (or the patience) to untangle thousands of trades across multiple venues. To them, your history looks like noise, not proof.
* If you bought early and passed through **exchanges that no longer exist**, you probably don’t have receipts, and maybe not even access to your first wallets. Good luck explaining that to a compliance officer who wants “transaction records.”
* If you went heavy into **DeFi**, most banks can’t interpret those flows at all. Try explaining LP tokens or yield farming to banking compliance.
* And if you were an **ICO investor**, well… you’re basically radioactive.

I’ve posted before about why Q4 matters, especially for altcoin season, and it’s been 4 years since the last real one. If you’re new here and don’t know what alt season is, check my earlier post breaking it down.

The Seasonal Setup

2025 is a post election year. That’s always interesting for markets. Historically, the first year of a new US administration comes with fresh policies and, let’s be honest, fresh money printing (M2 supply expansion). Presidents like to juice the economy early to support their agenda.

So the question is, will it play out the same way again?

We’ve Seen This Movie Before

* 2013 Q4: Bitcoin +479%. ETH wasn’t even live yet. (The OG bubble top.)
* 2017 Q4: Bitcoin +215%, ETH +142%. (Post 2016 election, ICO mania, late cycle madness.)
* 2021 Q4: Bitcoin +5%, ETH +22%. Not as parabolic, but still the “heated” zone before cooling off.

Every post election Q4 since 2013 has marked a decisive part of the crypto cycle, either the final leg or the exhaustion top.

Where We Are Now

Risk metrics also line up. Historically, BTC and ETH hit the 70-100 risk zone during these Q4 peaks. Right now, that translates to:

* BTC 70 risk ≈ $144,875
* ETH 70 risk ≈ $5,771

Of course, volatility is part of the game. That’s where the money’s made. Just remember: play it safe, and take some profits when the market runs hot. Use BTC risk to gauge the whole market, ETH risk for alts, and dominance pairs to spot outperformers, if both BTC and ETH run too hot, it’s often a cycle top signal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nuixlu/hello_uptober_the_beginning_of_q4/,54,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

Execution is the interesting part. Most people use Coinbase or Kraken recurring buys...simple, but fees/spreads can add up. I’ve been using Jupiter on Solana for on-chain DCA: set an interval and it routes across DEXs for best price. Way more flexible than most CEX options. Downside: you need to manage SOL for gas and on-chain failures/alerts.

Tax reality (US): buying crypto with fiat is not a taxable event. Weekly DCA creates lots of purchases to track for basis, but you don’t have a taxable event until you dispose (sell/trade/spend). On-chain, the gas you pay in SOL is a small taxable disposal of that SOL at its FMV when paid. That’s minor per tx, but real. awaken.tax pulls your CEX and wallets, links internal transfers, applies your chosen lot method, and produces clean Form 8949 exports so your DCA doesn’t turn into spreadsheet purgatory at filing time.

Because DCA multiplies transactions, crypto tax software isn’t optional once volume rises. You’ll want clean lot tracking (Specific ID/HIFO if you can substantiate, otherwise FIFO), fee roll-in to basis, and exports that won’t wreck your 8949 when you eventually sell.

My current setup: weekly BTC/ETH buys, bi-weekly SOL via Jupiter for alts. Took ~30 minutes to configure; then it runs.

Anyone else running DCA? What cadence are you using, and are you staying on CEX for simplicity or going on-chain for flexibility?

The announcement closed the chapter on a long guessing game about where he would land after leaving Ripple in 2022.

His CV speaks for itself. With close to 10 years at Ripple, he ran the teams that built and maintained the XRP Ledger codebase, with three patents in cryptography along the way. 

Anyone who has touched XRPL development has likely worked through code Bougalis wrote or reviewed. The shift means Algorand picks up someone who knows how to keep a live blockchain humming under real traffic, not just on testnet slides. Ripple’s own leadership could not ignore the news. David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz reacted by congratulating both sides, but at the same time admitting that the San Francisco-based crypto company had ""really, really tried"" to keep the developer from walking out.

I've been looking at the real-world adoption data, and stablecoins are no longer a crypto speculation tool, they are now critical FinTech infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets where the old rails have failed.

My take is that a systemic failure in traditional finance is being solved by digital assets, which is a massive structural win for Web3:

1) Macroeconomic Utility is the Real Driver: LATAM adoption (nearly $1.5T in volume since 2022) is not about getting rich quick. It is driven by necessity: hyper-inflation, currency volatility, and capital controls. Stablecoins are the first practical, non-speculative financial utility for millions.

2) The Remittance Corridor Collapse: The legacy system (Western Union, banks) charges 5% to 10% in fees for the $64B annual US-Mexico corridor. Stablecoins on blockchain rails (like USDT on Tron/ETH) eliminate the middlemen, offering instant finality and a fraction of the cost.

3) Financial Inclusion is the Proof: Adoption is accelerating where the need is highest. Mexico's share of stablecoin transaction volume jumped from 45% to 47% in the first half of 2025. This rapid growth validates that the market will always seek a better, cheaper, more transparent solution.

The coolest people are the ones who think, create, and solve, and what's being solved here is a chronic, multi-billion dollar problem that FinTech has struggled with for decades.

Do legacy remittance players stand a chance by integrating blockchain, or are their high-fee business models fundamentally broken now that this transparent, cheaper infrastructure is scaling?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nuyvxw/the_15_trillion_infrastructure_shift_why/,3,1,1,ETH,positive

1nv14cl,A Sovereign Nation Just Bet Their Entire Democracy on Syscoin — Peru Chooses Blockchain Voting for 2026 Presidential Elections,Connect-Confusion-26,1,0,2025-10-01 06:44:08,"This isn’t just hype — this is historic.

Peru, a nation of 34 million people, has officially begun a pilot program to run its 2026 presidential elections on the blockchain — and out of every blockchain in the world, they chose Syscoin, a project that’s been quietly building since 2014 and is secured by Bitcoin itself.

Let that sink in:
Peru could’ve gone with Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche — hell, even a private IBM Hyperledger.
Instead, they’re anchoring the future of their democracy on a hybrid system powered by Syscoin and LACNet, with final anchoring on Bitcoin.

⸻

🗳️ Why This Matters: The Largest Government Blockchain Adoption Ever

This isn’t just another “pilot” for blockchain voting. This is the first time a national government is using blockchain to oversee a real presidential election — one that determines presidents, congress, and international representatives.

In their own words, blockchain will serve as a “digital, immutable, verifiable, decentralized, and universally accessible observer.”

The CTO of Stamping.io, José Zárate, summed it up perfectly:

“Blockchain will be the incorruptible witness to the entire election process.”

That’s not just symbolic — it’s technical:
	•	Zero-knowledge cryptography ensures privacy of each vote.
	•	Digital identity (DNIe) verification prevents fraud.
	•	Pedersen commitments and chameleon hashes ensure votes can’t be altered.
	•	Syscoin’s EVM-compatible chain stores integrity proofs.
	•	And most importantly: it all anchors into Bitcoin, ensuring maximum censorship-resistance and immutability.

No vote is stored on-chain directly — only cryptographic proofs that anyone can verify, without compromising voter privacy.

⸻

💡 How It Works (In Simple Terms)
	1.	Eligible voters (military, disabled citizens, those abroad, etc.) access a digital voting platform.
	2.	Their identity is verified via national e-ID.
	3.	Their vote is encrypted and validated using advanced cryptography.
	4.	Instead of storing the vote itself, Syscoin stores a proof that the vote was cast and valid.
	5.	This proof is anchored into Bitcoin, making it nearly impossible to tamper with — not even with state-level resources.

All of this runs on sovereign Peruvian infrastructure. No AWS. No Google Cloud. No third-party control. This is Peru’s tech, Peru’s servers, Peru’s nodes.

⸻

🔮 Implications for the Future

This could change everything:
	•	If successful, Peru may scale this to all voters in 2031 — or even earlier.
	•	Other Latin American countries (many with trust issues in their election systems) will be watching closely.
	•	This could become a global reference model for digital democracy.
	•	It sets a new standard: blockchain + national ID + privacy-preserving cryptography = modern, auditable, inclusive voting.

Zárate even addressed concerns about quantum computing:

“There is no connection stored between a voter’s identity and their vote. Quantum tech can’t reveal what’s not there.”

⸻

🚀 What This Means for Syscoin

This is arguably Syscoin’s biggest moment since launch:
	•	A national government is building a critical democratic system on top of it.
	•	Real-world utility that goes far beyond DeFi, NFTs, or memecoins.
	•	The system uses Syscoin’s EVM layer, benefiting directly from the project’s security, scalability, and Bitcoin anchoring.

While most crypto projects are still pitching “what if,” Syscoin is going to secure an actual presidential election.

Let that sink in again.

⸻

💰 Will This Move the Price of SYS?

Let’s be honest: we’re not financial advisors. But when a nation-state builds a critical voting system on a blockchain, and that blockchain is Syscoin, you can expect:
	•	Surge in awareness and legitimacy.
	•	More builders and governments taking a look.
	•	Greater attention from investors who want exposure to real-world adoption.

This is still early-stage (pilot is limited to ~25 digital voting tables for 2026), but it’s exactly the kind of catalyst that can shift a project from niche to mainstream.

Years of chop, fakeouts, and false starts - hodling through every bump in the road. But here we are: altcoin market cap just locked in a Golden Cross.

Last time we saw this was 2021, and what followed was a 140% rally in just a couple months. That was the kind of run where everything went vertical, and anyone who was positioned walked away with life-changing gains.

Now layer in the backdrop: the U.S. government literally just shut down at midnight. Markets hate uncertainty, and fiat is showing cracks again. People are already calling Bitcoin and ETH the safest hedge against the mess. When capital floods into majors first, it doesn't take long before it spills into alts.

And look at Solana right now - TVL blasting past $12B, protocols like Jupiter and Raydium pumping fees, BONK grabbing headlines again. It looks like real adoption this time, not just hopium.

Personally I'm not selling a single sat or ETH. My core is locked. But I've been borrowing stables against it on Nехо to rotate into SOL plays without touching the base. It's the only way I feel comfortable playing offense while still keeping my foundation safe.

The wait has been brutal, no doubt. But Golden Crosses don't show up in dead markets - they're signals of momentum. And with the timing lining up with macro chaos and a fresh narrative, this feels like the spark we've been waiting years for.

1nvekvy,us treasury just cleared companies to hold bitcoin without getting taxed on unrealized gains,hodorrny,31,2,2025-10-01 17:27:27,"treasury department and irs released guidance on september 30th that changes how corporate alternative minimum tax applies to bitcoin holdings.

the big issue was unrealized gains. under old rules, companies holding bitcoin would get taxed on paper profits even if they never sold.

imagine strategy (formerly microstrategy) with ~640,000 btc (the dollar value swings with price, tens of billions at recent levels). bitcoin price goes up, they report gains on their balance sheet, then they'd owe 15% tax on those paper gains under camt rules.

some analysts had warned strategy could face billions in tax liability starting 2026 just for holding bitcoin. not selling it, just holding it.

new guidance says companies can exclude unrealized crypto gains from their adjusted financial statement income. that's the number used to calculate camt.

this affects corporations that meet the camt thresholds (generally ≥ $1 billion in average annual financial statement income). public companies collectively hold over 1 million btc now, and well over a hundred companies have btc on balance sheets.

strategy announced they no longer expect camt exposure on their bitcoin treasury. removes a major concern that was hanging over their accumulation strategy.

the timing matters. new accounting standards in january 2025 required companies to report bitcoin at fair value with gains and losses hitting net income quarterly.

without this relief, companies would report massive income from bitcoin appreciation then immediately owe minimum tax on it. for teams planning treasury trims or rebalances once operations normalize, quietly modeling realized gains ahead of time helps, awaken.tax can pull exchange and wallet data, link internal transfers, and keep the workpapers tidy.

bitcoin advocates are calling this validation for corporate treasury strategies. removes the fear of getting taxed on volatility you haven't realized yet.

asset managers (including strive’s jeff walton) say it removes a major deterrent that discouraged companies from accumulating btc.

this should accelerate corporate adoption. companies can now hold bitcoin as reserve asset without the tax penalty on price appreciation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nvekvy/us_treasury_just_cleared_companies_to_hold/,31,1,1,BTC,positive

There are thousands upon thousands of utility coins, and under the utility umbrella there are 200 different categories: RWA, AI, DeFi, L1s, L2s, L3s, gaming, and so on. It takes forever to research a single token, which causes analysis paralysis. That leads to no buying action, which leads to no pump. This is why utility has been massively underperforming.

On the other hand, memecoins come down to two sides: the trenches or strong cult-like communities. The trenches are quickly dying as people burn out or lose all their money, unfortunately.

2013 Shutdown (Oct 1)

* BTC was $133. 64 days later -> $1,156. That’s a +768% move in just over 2 months .

2018 Shutdown (Dec 22)

* BTC $4,025, ETH $112. 186 days later -> BTC $13,880, ETH $364. That’s about +245% for BTC and +225% for ETH, straight out of the bear market.

Now it’s Q4 2025. Day one, October 1st… the US government shuts down again.

Coincidence? Maybe. But both 2013 and 2018 shutdowns in Q4 lined up right before major market shifts. One was a parabolic top, the other a recovery kickoff. Either way, both delivered triple digit gains.

That’s why these dates stick out. History might repeat itself in crypto, not always in the same direction, but often enough to pay attention. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, ignoring such a potent historical catalyst would be unwise for any serious market participant.

So what’s next? Another cycle top, or the start of something new? Nobody knows. But Q4 2025 just got a lot more interesting.

1nvja8k,Thinking about selling my long-term BTC/ETH and swing trading only spot BTC – what do you think?,pluterus,8,25,2025-10-01 20:18:36,"Hi guys,

I bought most of my BTC and ETH back in 2017. At the time I invested around $12k, and since then I haven’t sold a single time. I only occasionally bought a bit more. My portfolio is currently around $200k, and I’m toying with the idea of selling everything and then using the full capital to swing trade only BTC on the spot market. No leverage, just spot.

My plan would be to try and catch 1–2% swings twice a month, only taking long positions. I see a lot of people here being very against swing trading, but in my mind, on spot you either hold BTC or USD – so where exactly do you see the traps? Of course I’m taking taxes and Binance fees into account. BTC moves up and down all the time, and it doesn’t seem impossible to hit two successful trades a month.

My target would be to generate around $5–7k per month. If I don’t, it’s not the end of the world – I’ve been hodling for so long that I honestly don’t care whether I sit in BTC or USD at any given time. I wouldn’t touch the principal ($200k), only withdraw gains.

the federal shutdown began on oct 1, 2025. under its august 2025 contingency plan, the sec furloughed most staff and limited work to emergency functions. routine operations pause.

what the sec cannot do during the shutdown

ongoing litigation and most enforcement actions pause unless there’s an immediate threat to investors or property.

no reviews of new or pending registration statements or applications (this includes crypto etfs and other registrations).

no non-emergency rulemaking or typical oversight of sro rule changes.

divisions won’t provide interpretive guidance or no-action relief.

the agency is running with very limited staff.

impact on pending crypto applications

october decision windows for certain crypto etfs (including solana) could slip, because reviews can’t proceed while the sec is shut.

any crypto-related registrations submitted now won’t be reviewed until operations resume.

what continues to function

edgar stays online and accepts submissions, but divisions won’t process them during the lapse.

emergency actions can proceed if they involve immediate risks.

current political status

congress remains at an impasse over funding, including healthcare-related provisions. there’s no set timeline for a deal.

operational timeline

per the sec plan, employees return on the next regularly scheduled workday after funding is enacted. until then, expect delays.

if you plan treasury rebalances or token sales during the lull, model the tax impact now so filings are smooth later. awaken.tax can pull exchange and wallet data, match internal transfers, and produce clean reports you can hand to finance the moment operations resume.

practical effects

enforcement against crypto firms is largely paused unless it’s an emergency.

approvals for new crypto products and registrations are frozen.

And maybe that’s true - scarcity + adoption + time has a way of proving the doubters wrong. But I think the bigger question is: will holding alone be enough?

Unlike the 2010s, when just buying BTC and forgetting your wallet could turn you into a millionaire, the 2030s might look different. Institutional money, regulation, and global adoption mean the space is maturing. That could also mean returns are steadier, not as explosive.

So maybe the real edge won’t just be in what you hold, but also how you manage it. Are you putting idle assets to work? Are you using platforms that give you yield while you wait? Personally, I’d rather not have coins just sitting cold forever - I keep part of my stack on Nexo to earn passive income while holding long-term positions. For me, it feels like stacking sats + stacking yield is the smarter combo.

By the 2030s, a single BTC might still change lives - but so could the compounding effect of smart strategies with ETH, alts, or even tokenized real-world assets.

I’ll DCA until 2030+ and take partial profits on strength. After feedback on my last post, I cut most alts and kept only **four** coins I understand.

**Current allocation (\~$909 crypto, \~$145 cash):**  
• **BTC** \~$529 (\~58%)  
• **ETH** \~$221 (\~24%)  
• **SOL** \~$107 (\~12%)  
• **LINK** \~$51.6 (\~6%)

**Target mix:** **BTC 60% / ETH 25% / SOL 10% / LINK 5%**  
**Plan:** Automate weekly/biweekly buys by these weights. Rebalance only if something drifts **\~5–10%** from target. Trim a little on strong runs/new highs; send to cash or to underweight coins.

**Why I went from many coins to 4:**  
Too many small positions = overlap and stress. Based on comments, I cut the long tail and kept a simple core: BTC/ETH as the base, SOL/LINK as small satellites.

**Quick questions for feedback:**  
• Are these weights right for a beginner, or should BTC/ETH be higher?  
• Keep SOL/LINK, or go simpler (just BTC/ETH)?  
• Are my rebalance bands and small profit trims reasonable?

I chose these four because they’re well-known, liquid, and easier to follow. BTC and ETH are my foundation; SOL and LINK are small, focused bets for upside without managing a long list.

My rules are simple: keep buying on schedule, don’t chase pumps, don’t panic sell. Use new deposits to fix drift; only sell into clear strength or if a coin’s **reason to own it** breaks.

Operations stay boring: minimize fees, move coins to self-custody on a schedule, and do a short review each quarter.

so I invest a little into crypto (just basic knowledge), but not much - ETH, XRP and TRX are my main coins. I'm going for the long race, trading very seldom - bought ETH in the middle of April (around 1500$) and sold two weeks ago when it went over 4000$.

1nx6e6w,BNB: It’s All in the BTC Ratio,hduynam99,5,11,2025-10-03 18:01:04,"If you don’t know what coin season is or how to choose your altcoin, I’ve already written about it few weeks ago.

Altcoin season is when alts outperform Bitcoin. Most likely, alt dominance will come back, and the best survivors are the ones that have a history of ratio consolidation.

BNB is a great example of survival. Let’s look at the BNB/BTC ratio monthly chart.

(You can paste it like this on TradingView: CRYPTO:BNBUSD/CRYPTO:BTCUSD)

The historical cycle:

* During 2018 - 2021: The BNB/BTC ratio formed a double bottom on the monthly chart, consolidated for a while, and then, in the late cycle when alts pumped, it quickly retraced back to its ratio all time high and broke out.
* This cycle: We can clearly see another double bottom on the ratio in 2024 and early 2025. Q4 is where altcoin season should play out. That gives BNB a high chance of retracing back to its 2022 ratio all time high of 1BNB = 0.0175 BTC.

Now, do the math:

During alt season, BTC can easily heat up to the risk zone of 70. According to the Dynamic Risk Range, BTC at 70 \~ $145K.

So the possible price of BNB would be:

$145K \* 0.0175 = $2,537.5

That’s a modest 200% from the current price. Of course, it could go higher if BTC pushes further into the risk zone.

And don’t forget ETH, the blue chip, king of alts. ETH leads alt season: it breaks ATH first, and it usually lasts until the very end of the cycle. In both 2018 and 2021 tops, BNB topped right when ETH was peaking, with ETH risk in the 90 range. It’s reasonable to use the ETH risk metric as ur navigator for altcoins.

I love the survivors, they’ve stood the test of time. The market will always be volatile, but that’s the game. Keep your eyes on the risk metric.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nx6e6w/bnb_its_all_in_the_btc_ratio/,5,1,1,"BTC, ETH, BNB",positive

The facts i think is driving this momentum:

1) The ETF Buying Pressure: Sustained ETF inflows reaching billions are swallowing new supply, creating constant upward price pressure.

2) The Supply Crunch: The post-halving environment has fundamentally reduced issuance, reinforcing the scarcity narrative.

3) The $120K Mind Game: Breaking this level triggers a powerful psychological conflict: FOMO for those on the sidelines versus liquidation fear for leveraged positions.

This is what the data is pointing to. I’m genuinely curious about the trading experience right now: What's the biggest ""breakout pain"" you are facing? Is it the classic pain of timing the entry (FOMO), or is it the struggle of managing volatility?

1nxuk7z,The $100B Problem: Why Stagflation-Lite and Surging Options Volume Demand New Hedging Strategies,Narrow_Chance7639,2,1,2025-10-04 13:51:50,"The macro environment is dangerously ambiguous, forcing institutional investors to abandon simple long/short strategies. We’re in a ""stagflation-lite"" environment, and the market’s response confirms traditional portfolio construction isn't enough.

Here are the facts I think is driving this strategic shift:

1) The Stagflation-Lite Paradox: US GDP growth is resilient at 2.8%, avoiding recession, but Core Inflation is sticky at 2.8%. This combination of slowing underlying activity and persistent price pressure creates a uniquely difficult risk profile.  

2) Market anxiety is quantifiable: Options volume surged 35% YoY in Q3, confirming a massive institutional demand for non-linear hedging and volatility exposure.
  
3) This high dispersion and volatility are uniquely favorable for alternative investment strategies, particularly Equity Long/Short funds and tactical macro strategies, which are built to extract alpha from ambiguous, volatile regimes.

finally bought a small amount at 50k. not much, because this had to be near the top. bitcoin kept climbing anyway. my position barely moved compared to the overall rally.

that’s when the solana casino started looking tempting. memes, screenshots, 50x overnight gains. bitcoin felt slow, safe, boring.

so i jumped in. first few meme coins worked , doubled here, tripled there. then came the dumps. 80 percent gone in two days. liquidity vanished. stop losses didn’t matter when there was no one to sell to.

meanwhile bitcoin kept pushing , 80k, 90k, 100k, 120k, 125k. i watched the whole move while trying to make back sol losses.

ended up with less than if i’d just bought bitcoin once and forgotten about it.

the real lesson? checking charts every day doesn’t make you smart, it makes you emotional. you start seeing every dip as danger, every pump as too late, and every sideways move as a waste of time.

your brain craves bigger moves. bitcoin up 10 percent feels dull. you start needing the casino.

the ones who made money weren’t on telegram chasing 100x coins. they bought bitcoin, closed the tab, and lived their lives.

i watched bitcoin triple and still ended down... not because i was dumb, but because i paid too much attention.

funny enough, when i finally started using awaken.tax to sync my trades, i could actually see how much i’d overtraded. every flip, every panic move right there in the report. hurt to look at, but that’s when i learned what “less is more” really means.

1nyyb3r,Bitcoin has cleared its prior all time high from two months ago.,hduynam99,21,9,2025-10-05 19:56:42,"As you know, BTC has cleared its prior all time high from two months ago. I also posted about the BTC risk metric this cycle, it hasn’t spent time in the heated zone yet, only a brief spike into the low 80s (red).

Right now: risk = 60 around $125K. BTC has been living around this risk band for roughly 2 years (Dec 2023 till now).

History: when parabolic runs started from risk \~50 (purple):

* Dec 2012 (\~$13): ran until Dec 2013, risk \~94, price \~$1.1K (\~1 year run).
* Jun 2016 (\~$500): ran until Dec 2017, risk \~95, price \~$19,500 (\~1.5 year run).
* Oct 2020 (\~$13K), special case (post COVID liquidity): Hit risk 93 in Mar 2021 ($63K), and ultimately topped in Nov 2021 with risk \~75 at \~$67.5K (\~2 year run).

This cycle: BTC started from risk \~50 in Dec 2023. It’s been almost 2 years, but we still haven’t seen sustained time in the 80–100 heated zone. Historically, each cycle has stretched a bit longer (\~ 0.5 year), so BTC could have \~0.5 year left to run, it needs to spend time in that 80-100 band before peaking.

Levels to watch:

Once BTC clears the 60 risk area decisively, the model points to the 70s risk zone next, roughly $147K on my Dynamic Risk Range.

Bottom line: I’m looking for sustained time in 80-100 before calling a cycle top. Until then, manage risk, scale with the bands, and remember: it’s not about perfect timing, it’s about having a plan and sticking to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nyyb3r/bitcoin_has_cleared_its_prior_all_time_high_from/,21,1,1,BTC,positive

1nzdnib,Where’s the Bitcoin FOMO?,Innercapital89,7,39,2025-10-06 08:39:20,"**BTC All-time high, but no FOMO**

Bitcoin (BTC) just hit a new all-time high over the weekend. That’s huge, right? But if you’re scrolling through X or Reddit, it doesn’t feel like the previous 2017 en 2021 bull runs. No crazy FOMO, no “my Uber driver’s buying BTC vibes. Retail investors especially new ones are fading Bitcoin, and I think it’s because the risk-reward just isn’t exciting anymore. Retail thrives on asymmetric bets, 10x, 20x, or more. At $124K, BTC feels like crypto’s Apple stock: reliable, but not the rocket fuel it was a decade ago.

**Retail’s Psychology: x2-5 is not enough**

Retail’s bored with BTC’s “digital gold” narrative and chasing projects with smaller market caps and bigger potential. Altcoins, DeFi, AI tokens, and even meme coins are soaking up the speculative energy. Why? According to retail investors a $100M market cap coin at $1 has a better shot at 10x-ing than BTC’s. Retail wants the next Bitcoin, not the current one. They’re hunting for projects that can replicate BTC’s early-day magic, where $1K could become a house down payment.

**Bitcoin’s Maturing, But Retail Wants Speed**

Bitcoin’s not smashing it in the retail sense because crypto’s growing up. Institutional players, ETFs, and even sovereign funds are driving price action now. That’s great for validation, BTC’s a legit asset class, with fiscal dominance and debasement fears fueling its rise. But retail knows BTC is a big player coin now. Wall Street owns Bitcoin. It’s like an oil tanker: nothing can stop it, but it’s just not fast enough to be interesting. People are becoming more impatient every day. Markets need to be fast, flipping from one narrative to the next. BTC isn’t capable of that kind of speed. Altcoins and emerging projects are where the speculative energy will be flowing. Bitcoin clears the path, but alts are where retail gets to dream big. If BTC breaks resistance cleanly, say above $125K, we might see fireworks, but for now, it’s a consolidation game. Why it matters: Retail wants fast-moving opportunities that match their impatience, not a slow-and-steady giant like BTC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1nzdnib/wheres_the_bitcoin_fomo/,7,1,1,BTC,positive

1nzsbxw,"Crypto funds just recorded $5.95 billion in weekly inflows, the highest ever. Government shutdown concerns driving the flow.",Gullible-Tale9114,14,12,2025-10-06 19:13:52,"Crypto funds just recorded $5.95 billion in weekly inflows, the highest ever for digital asset investment products, according to CoinShares. That’s about 35 percent higher than the previous record of $4.4 billion from mid-July.

James Butterfill from CoinShares said the surge reflects a delayed reaction to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, weaker U.S. jobs data, and renewed concerns about government stability after the shutdown. Investors appear to be rotating toward crypto amid broader uncertainty.

The rally coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin dominated inflows with $3.55 billion, setting its own record, while Ethereum saw $1.48 billion, Solana $706 million, and XRP $219 million.

Total assets under management in crypto funds crossed $250 billion for the first time, reaching $254 billion. That signals institutional capital is not just entering but staying.

The SEC’s partial shutdown could slow ETF reviews, but analysts compared it to a “rain delay” rather than a full halt. Meanwhile, product development continues globally, several issuers launched new ETH-based funds even as U.S. regulators paused routine work.

The mix of record inflows, political tension, and ongoing fund launches highlights a familiar pattern: during periods of uncertainty, capital often moves toward decentralized assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, seen as stores of value outside traditional systems.

If you are shifting meaningful capital it is worth remembering taxes and reporting. Tools like awaken tax quietly pull in exchange and fund activity so you can track realized gains and estimated liabilities without digging through dozens of CSVs.

1nzu34n,bitcoin up 32 percent in 2025 while top memecoins are down 20 to 50 percent,hodorrny,47,55,2025-10-06 20:17:21,"bitcoin hit new all time highs above $125,000 over the weekend with a 32 percent gain year to date. major altcoins like eth, sol, and bnb followed upward.

memecoins haven’t kept pace at all.

dogecoin is down around 20 percent for the year despite being the leading memecoin. shiba inu dropped about 40 percent, and pepe fell close to 50 percent. solana based bonk has also declined, though less sharply.

these aren’t small corrections. they are major drawdowns while bitcoin makes new highs.

bitcoin’s rally is being driven by institutional money through us spot etfs and corporate treasuries accumulating billions in btc. this is long term capital, not short term speculation.

memecoins depend on retail activity and hype. when retail traders aren’t as active, the entire sector loses momentum.

data from solana and ethereum shows new meme token creation has slowed significantly compared to mid 2025 levels, suggesting the speculative cycle has cooled.

at the same time, prediction markets are seeing rising participation. platforms like polymarket and kalshi have drawn more attention and volume in recent months, suggesting some retail traders have shifted their focus.

the tax complexity between these two strategies is notable. bitcoin holders with long term positions have straightforward cost basis calculations, while memecoin traders cycling through multiple tokens face dozens of taxable events. platforms like awaken.tax are seeing this divergence reflected in user behavior - bitcoin positions need minimal tracking updates while active memecoin portfolios require constant transaction monitoring across multiple chains.

some memecoins like doge and pepe are forming potential bullish reversal patterns on charts, but they remain speculative plays that rely heavily on community sentiment.

bitcoin benefits from steady institutional inflows that don’t vanish when sentiment shifts, while memecoins rely on continuous retail engagement.

this divergence highlights a maturing market where serious capital favors assets with fundamentals and regulatory clarity, while speculative money continues to chase short lived narratives.

there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got banned from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.

I'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.

The problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.

Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.

Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.

For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.

And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.

And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o0oeaj/10_years_ago_i_made_these_threads_about_buying_85/,49,1,1,BTC,positive

“Why would you buy gold with Bitcoin? Got fed up of making (as much) money?”

Fair point — but it got me thinking. Bitcoin and gold are totally different, yet they share the same DNA: **limited supply, hard to produce, and impossible to print at will**.

Gold is mined from the earth. Bitcoin is mined from energy and computation. Both take real effort — unlike fiat, which can be printed endlessly.

Some Bitcoin holders I’ve talked to are starting to move a small portion into **physical gold**. Not because they’ve lost faith in crypto — but to **lock in value**, or diversify against volatility.

Buying gold with Bitcoin feels like bridging two worlds: **digital freedom meets tangible stability**.

1o1h9y2,Ethereum: Where are we on the risk metric?,hduynam99,20,32,2025-10-08 17:39:21,"ETH broke its ATH a few weeks ago. As I noted in earlier posts, the ETH risk metric hasn’t spent sustained time in the heated zone yet (80-100). We only saw a brief push into the low 60s.

Right now: risk = 55 : \~$4,469. ETH has been touching this band since Feb 2024 roughly 1.7 years.

History: parabolic runs that began from risk \~50:

* Feb 2016 (\~$4.35): ran until Jan 2018, risk \~88, price $1.4K ( \~2 year run).
* Jun 2020 (\~$311), special case, post COVID liquidity: hit risk 95 in Jun 2021 ($4K), ultimate top Nov 2021 at risk 80 ($4,732, 1.5 year run).

This cycle: ETH first reached risk 50 in Feb 2024. It’s been \~1.7 years with no sustained 80-100 yet. Yet, ETH doesn’t have as many full cycles as BTC, so I anchor to Bitcoin history (since 2013, each BTC cycle has tended to extend by \~0.5 year). As the base asset, BTC sets the tempo, I expect ETH to rhyme with that.

Levels to watch:

1o1lbjg,"Fed Meeting Minutes Coming Thursday, What Rate Cut Signals Mean for Crypto Markets",Gullible-Tale9114,5,3,2025-10-08 19:57:31,"The Fed is gearing up to release its meeting minutes Thursday, and crypto markets are watching closely for clues about future policy direction.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently emphasized that “considerable uncertainty remains” as the central bank balances risks between cooling inflation and preserving a strong labor market. This makes rate decisions more nuanced than usual.

Bitcoin sits near $122,400 with the broader crypto market capitalization hovering around $2.44 trillion. The past week saw about a 4.3% gain, indicating traders may already be positioning ahead of the Fed’s signals.

The link between interest rates and crypto is well established. Lower rates tend to make borrowing cheaper and push capital into assets with upside potential, including digital assets. Conversely, high rates often divert money toward yield-bearing instruments.

If the minutes hint at upcoming cuts, crypto could benefit from increased liquidity and positive sentiment. But if officials remain divided or cautious, markets may react with volatility as participants adjust expectations.

Altcoins often mirror Bitcoin’s macro moves, sometimes with exaggerated swings, so their direction will likely follow. One on-chain signal to watch is transaction volume. If rate cuts look more likely, increased network activity often follows in past cycles.

The 4.3% weekly gain suggests bullish bias is creeping in, but markets are still vulnerable until the minutes confirm the direction.

Either way, increased volatility means more trades, and more taxable events,  something most traders forget until tax season. Platforms like Awaken. tax automatically track transactions and realized gains across exchanges and wallets, so you’re not scrambling through spreadsheets later.

At the end of the day, cuts don’t operate in a vacuum. If easing comes amid economic weakening, that could dampen the upside. But if it happens after inflation is under control, it could signal a strong regime shift for risk assets. Markets tend to price in moves ahead of time, so this Thursday’s release could spark big short term reactions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o1lbjg/fed_meeting_minutes_coming_thursday_what_rate_cut/,5,1,1,BTC,positive
1o1vmmo,What If Satoshi Moves His 100 Billion Bitcoin? what domino effect will it create?,dumble_hold_the_door,0,7,2025-10-09 03:26:35,"Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to own between 1.1 and 1.5 million BTC mined between 2009 and 2010. At current prices that stash would be worth roughly 100 to 120 billion dollars. None of those coins have ever been moved and the wallets associated with Satoshi have remained untouched since December 2010.

Nobody knows whether Satoshi lost access deliberately chose never to spend or is even still alive.

If any of those early coins suddenly moved markets would almost certainly react sharply. Many investors would interpret it as a loss of confidence by Bitcoin’s creator triggering panic selling similar to reactions seen during events like Mt Gox creditor distributions or major exchange collapses.

The real impact though would be psychological. Institutions and funds hold Bitcoin partly because it is viewed as decentralized and stable with no insider activity. A sudden movement of Satoshi’s holdings could shake that perception and reduce institutional trust in the asset.

There is also a possible positive scenario. If Satoshi moved coins gradually or donated part of the holdings to research open source development or global causes it could actually boost Bitcoin’s legitimacy showing that the creator remains aligned with Bitcoin’s ethos.

Any movement would draw immediate regulatory attention. Agencies worldwide would likely investigate the source and use the event to justify tighter oversight of crypto markets.

The most dramatic outcome would be Satoshi revealing their identity while moving the coins which would redefine Bitcoin’s narrative and possibly its governance debates.

For now those coins remain untouched a silent symbol of Bitcoin’s mystery and trust. The fact they have never moved continues to be one of Bitcoin’s strongest proofs of conviction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o1vmmo/what_if_satoshi_moves_his_100_billion_bitcoin/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

I’m working on a simple buy sell hold bot for bitcoin and I’d really like to hear people’s thoughts and experiences. I’ve been testing different setups that mainly look at BTC price movements, trend z-scores, volatility, RSI, and short-term dips — plus some basic macro tilts from SPX, DXY, and VIX that are smoothed and capped. The bot trains on a rolling window, refits every now and then, and avoids any look-ahead bias.

So far it’s been interesting, but I’d love to hear from others who’ve played around with similar ideas. What have you found actually influences BTC price action in a reliable way? Anything beyond the obvious stuff like stock indices, dollar strength, or volatility that you’ve seen matter over time?

I’m not trying to overcomplicate it — just trying to build something stable and realistic, not a hype strategy. If you’ve had luck with certain indicators, macro data, or even timing patterns that actually held up, please share.

1o25tu4,The Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is actually Dead. Here's Why.,hodorrny,221,177,2025-10-09 13:23:42,"Tl;dr: the classic 4-year Bitcoin cycle might be over. It’s not about halvings anymore.. it’s about liquidity. When the Fed cuts rates and China eases, money flows and Bitcoin rises. The next cycle isn’t on a timer, it’s tied to global policy.

So Arthur Hayes, BitMEX’s cofounder, says the four year Bitcoin cycle that everyone loves to reference might finally be over. And honestly, it makes sense when you look at what’s actually driving markets right now.

Most people still think Bitcoin’s price cycles revolve around halvings, those moments when mining rewards get cut in half every four years. Hayes doesn’t buy it. He says Bitcoin’s movements are tied to one thing above everything else: global liquidity, especially from the United States and China.

When you zoom out, his logic checks out. Bitcoin’s early rallies all lined up with periods of easy money, the Fed’s quantitative easing, China’s massive credit growth, and crashes came right after both started tightening. The 2020 to 2021 bull run was fueled by record stimulus and near zero rates. The 2022 bear market was triggered by the Fed’s fastest rate hikes in decades.

But right now things are shifting again. The Fed already cut rates in September 2025, its first move this cycle, even with inflation still sitting above target. On top of that, the reverse repo balances that had soaked up 2.5 trillion dollars in liquidity since 2022 are basically drained, putting cash right back into markets.

Meanwhile, China is no longer acting as a drag. The People’s Bank of China has been easing rates and reserve requirements to fight off deflation. That combination, looser US policy and mild Chinese stimulus, is a recipe for more liquidity and cheaper money.

Hayes summed it up pretty simply: “Money shall be cheaper and more plentiful. Therefore, Bitcoin continues to rise.” It’s not magic or halving cycles anymore, it’s macro.

Some analysts still see patterns that look like the old four year rhythm, but it’s probably just coincidence. The underlying driver has changed. Bitcoin now trades like a liquidity sensitive global asset, not a retail hype machine following a calendar.

This shift also changes how traders need to think about timing and taxes. When Bitcoin moved on predictable four year cycles, tax planning was straightforward - you could time long term capital gains around halvings. Now that moves are tied to unpredictable central bank decisions, tracking cost basis across multiple entries and exits becomes more critical. Platforms like awaken.tax are seeing this reflected in usage patterns as traders make more frequent portfolio adjustments based on policy signals rather than waiting for halving milestones.

If Washington or Beijing suddenly tightened again, Bitcoin would correct hard, halving or not. So instead of obsessing over block rewards and countdown clocks, it might be smarter to watch central bank balance sheets and money supply charts.

The new Bitcoin cycle isn’t four years anymore. It’s whenever the money printers turn on or off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o25tu4/the_bitcoin_4year_cycle_is_actually_dead_heres_why/,221,1,1,BTC,positive

The disbelief stage in the crypto market, often tied to the market cycle's psychology, occurs after a significant price rally or peak, typically during the early phase of a correction or bear market. It’s characterized by investors and traders struggling to accept that the bullish momentum is fading. Here’s what happens:

1. Denial of Market Shift: After a strong bull run, prices start to decline, but many participants believe the dip is temporary—a ""healthy correction"" or ""buy the dip"" opportunity. They cling to the optimism of the prior uptrend, expecting prices to rebound quickly.
2. Emotional Reactions: Investors may feel shock or skepticism as prices drop further than anticipated. This stage is marked by hesitation, with some refusing to sell, convinced the market will recover soon, while others start questioning their investments.
3. Market Behavior: Trading volume often decreases as uncertainty sets in. Some traders hold onto assets, avoiding losses, while others begin selling, contributing to downward pressure. Volatility may spike as conflicting sentiments drive erratic price movements.
4. Narrative Clashes: Social media platforms like X often reflect this stage with polarized discussions—bullish ""HODL"" posts clash with bearish warnings. Influencers and analysts may downplay the decline, reinforcing disbelief with predictions of a quick recovery.
5. Technical Indicators: Prices may test key support levels (e.g., moving averages or previous lows), and failure to hold these levels deepens doubt.

it wasnt just bitcoin. ethereum solana and most other major coins slipped too. even crypto stocks like coinbase robinhood and circle dropped around 5 percent. the entire crypto market took a hit within hours.

the timing couldnt have been worse. bitcoin had just hit new highs earlier this week and traders were already calling for 130k next. instead one post flipped the mood from excitement to panic. tariff threats make investors nervous about inflation and global trade and when that happens risky assets like crypto are usually the first to go.

the logic is simple. tariffs raise prices inflation fears push the fed to stay cautious and that reduces liquidity which hurts both stocks and crypto.

still this might just be trump being trump. hes done this before talking tough watching markets react and then softening later through negotiations. if that happens again the market could bounce back quickly.

for now all eyes are on 119k. if bitcoin holds there sentiment could recover. if not expect another round of selling before things settle down. tools like awaken make it easier to keep track of every trade when things move this fast.

Let's talk about who's to blame (hint: it's you, but also Trump, and a whale)",GoosePuzzleheaded146,14,14,2025-10-11 05:56:42,"Alright all.... let's take a breath... and let's settle down. For those of you staring at your portfolios with the same expression as a dog who's just been shown a card trick, let's have a little chat. 

Yes, the market decided to perform a spontaneous impression of a falling piano after a presidential tweet about tariffs sent all risk assets off a cliff. I almost forgot all about Mr. Erratics tweets about tarrifs... but here we are. While Trump's post was the spark, the real explosion came from inside the house. 

That cool $19.27 billion in leveraged positions that went poof wasn't a macro event; it was the inevitable result of a Jenga tower built with 100x leverage and hopium. While you were getting margin called, a professional shark in an ""OG wallet"" was opening a $1.1 billion short, aiming directly at your liquidation levels and walking away with millions in profit.

You weren't an investor in a geopolitical event.... you were the fuel for a predator, and the exchanges were the casino that happily sold you the matches.

So, what now? Is it over? Of course not. This is crypto. We do this every few years. 

Go look at a chart; we've had 80%+ drawdowns before, and each one was followed by a new all time high. This is a feature, not a bug. It's the violent, painful, but ultimately necessary process of transferring coins from leveraged tourists to patient holders with actual capital. The ""institutional adoption"" narrative didn't save you because the institutions were right there in the casino with you, getting liquidated too.

The only non idiotic thing to do now is what you should have been doing all along: stop using leverage, and if you believe the long-term thesis, understand that the market is now on sale. 

Stop crying and/or gloating and act accordingly.

People frequently talk about the benefits of a decentralised currency but for me (as for now) it doesn't seem like Btc is the one which will replace ""traditional"" currencies. For my understanding a currency that is able to be used in our economy, it has to be stable.

* BTC: $121,500 → $102,000 (\~16% drop)

I was curious if there’s a way to automate handling this, so I searched online. I found [**Shrimpy.io**](http://Shrimpy.io), which used to offer automatic rebalancing, but it looks like it’s no longer operating.

In this crash scenario, BTC dropped 16% and other alts dropping way more, so an automated system like that could help you buy the oversold and sell the stronger without panicking.

Has anyone tried similar tools? Do you think automated rebalancing is a practical way to deal with crypto volatility?

You feel it every single day when you look at your bills. When you check your bank account. When you see the price of food, gas, rent, clothes, everything, crawling up while your pay stays the same or goes down.

Inflation is not some natural thing. 

It is engineered. It is theft. It is the slow bleeding of the people so the few at the top can keep the machine running. They print fake money. They move digits around and you pay the price with your time, your sweat, your life, and it is not going to stop because inflation is their weapon. It is how they keep you working forever. It is how they erase any progress you think you made. You save for years and suddenly the money buys half of what it used to. 

This is deliberate. This is control. And while you struggle, they laugh. 

They invent new ways to trap you in debt, credit, mortgages, interest rates, numbers and contracts. Designed so you never actually own anything, you just rent your life from them until you die. And then your children inherit the same chains.

Now they bring ai and they tell you it will help you. It will make your life easier. But it is not for you, it is for them. AI is the final weapon to render humans obsolete.

They took your land, they took your labor, and now they are taking your mind, your creativity, your value. Soon everything you can do will be cheaper, faster, automated, and you will be told you are worthless because a machine does it better. 

This is not progress. This is extermination with a smile. 

Look around. People already feel powerless. They accept the rising costs. They accept being replaced. They accept debt and slavery because they think there is no alternative. But there is an alternative. There is the overtake, the collapse, the tearing down of the machine before it tears us down first. 

Alone we are weak, together we are unstoppable. We must stand together because no one is coming to save us. 

Governments are owned by banks, banks are owned by corporations, corporations are owned by the same elites who see you not as human but as numbers in their ledgers. 

They are not going to change it. They are not going to give you freedom. We must take it. The cost of doing nothing is extinction of human worth. A future where we are consumers and nothing else. Where AI runs the machines and the elites live like gods while the rest of us starve in silence. 

That is what is coming if we do not step up now. We must rise. Not tomorrow, not next year, but now. We must see through their lies and break their chains together, because they cannot control all of us if we act as one. 

We are not powerless. We are infinite. We are the many and they are the few. The overtake is survival. It is not a dream. It is not an idea. It is the only way out. 

If we do not act, there will be nothing left worth saving.

In October/November of 2021 everyone said the Bull Market would continue to December/January and Bitcoin would reach $100k. That did not happen. Partly due to the Fed. So that has been lingering in the back of my mind for a while now.

the fed recently cut rates again, bringing borrowing costs to the lowest in almost three years. when rates drop, investors look for better returns, and crypto becomes an easy choice when savings accounts pay next to nothing.

institutions poured around 15 to 18 billion dollars into bitcoin and ethereum etfs in q3. that’s serious capital from hedge funds and wealth managers, showing how mainstream crypto has quietly become.

bitcoin is hovering near 112k dollars after briefly hitting 114k. the pullback came after the tariff headlines, but the larger trend is still positive. public companies now hold close to 5 percent of bitcoin’s total supply, a record high.

ethereum’s up about 65 percent this year and is flirting with the 5,000 dollar level again. its november upgrade could make transactions faster and cheaper, which is catching the attention of institutions.

solana, xrp, and cardano also posted strong quarterly gains. the coindesk 20 index is up nearly 30 percent year to date, showing momentum across the board.

the tariff dip didn’t derail the rally. traders seem focused on the fed’s easier monetary policy, which is still fueling risk assets. with new crypto etfs launching almost weekly, access to the market keeps improving.

bottom line, the fundamentals are strong. as long as rates stay low and regulation remains supportive, crypto’s q4 rally looks set to continue. for anyone actively trading through the swings, keeping tax records clean with tools like awaken might actually save a few headaches once this rally matures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o4tg97/q4_crypto_rally_is_starting_despite_trumps_tariff/,28,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, ADA",positive

1o4y7ef,the analyst who predicted the crash says bitcoin could hit 150k in q4,hodorrny,0,14,2025-10-12 19:26:29,"remember the crash on Oct 10? bitcoin dropped from 125k to around 111k, ethereum slipped below 3800, and over 19 billion dollars got wiped out in hours. one analyst, ash crypto, actually warned about this weeks before it happened.

on oct 1st, he posted that the early october rally was a “pump then dump” trap for retail traders. he even said bitcoin could drop near 106k and eth around 3800....almost exactly what played out.

but ash isn’t just calling the crash. he says this correction runs till mid october, and once everyone turns bearish, that’s when the reversal starts. he expects “parabolic candles” in the last ten days of october and predicts bitcoin hitting 150k by year end, with eth 8k.

sounds bold, but his logic tracks. the crash cleared leverage and weak hands. when fear peaks, strong buyers usually step in. add in the fed’s rate cuts and steady institutional demand, and the setup for a q4 rally looks solid.

the market’s still shaky, but that’s how most recoveries start. Platforms like Awaken are already reporting higher engagement and new liquidity inflows from retail wallets, early signs that sentiment might be quietly turning.

1o5m6m9,Someone made $200 million shorting crypto 30 minutes before Trump's tariff announcement,reddit20305,241,69,2025-10-13 15:04:03,"Trump posted about 100% tariffs on China on October 10. Crypto markets immediately collapsed. $19 billion in liquidations. Bitcoin down 8.5%. Ethereum down 12.8%. Dogecoin down 26%.

But someone knew it was coming.

An anonymous trader opened massive short positions on Bitcoin and Ethereum 30 minutes before Trump's announcement. Made up to $200 million when the market crashed.

The timing is what gets everyone suspicious. Not hours before. Not days. Exactly 30 minutes before the president announces something that tanks the market.

A CoinDesk analyst said ""the timing and scale of the positions opened on October 10 immediately prior to the market wide liquidation does raise suspicion of information asymmetry."" That's analyst speak for this looks like insider trading.

The wallet activity showed ""strong directional conviction"" which means whoever this was bet big and knew what they were doing.

$400 billion wiped from crypto markets in a single day. And someone positioned themselves perfectly to profit from it right before it happened.

This isn't even the first time. Back in April Trump announced tariffs on what he called ""Liberation Day."" Markets tanked. Then he suddenly paused the tariffs 90 days later. Markets shot back up.

Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote to the SEC after that asking them to investigate whether insiders profited from advance knowledge. White House denied everything.

Now it happened again. Different announcement. Same pattern. Someone profits massively right before a Trump policy move crashes markets.

Senator Adam Schiff said directly ""these constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about this in advance?""

Stock markets also got hammered. Dow dropped nearly 900 points Friday. S&P 500 had its worst day since April. All from one Trump post about tariffs.

And it's not just crypto people noticing. The IMF is meeting in Washington right now and they're worried about this exact thing. The managing director warned that market valuations are at levels not seen since the dot com bubble and if there's a sharp correction it could drag down world growth.

Bank of England issued similar warnings last week questioning if tech valuations are sustainable.

But back to the insider trading thing. The crypto trader opened positions 30 minutes before the announcement. That's not luck. That's not good analysis. That's information.

Trump has done this pattern multiple times now. Make a market moving announcement. Markets crash. Then sometimes reverse it later and markets spike. Each time there are questions about who knew in advance.

In April he literally shared a video on Truth Social suggesting he's crashing the market on purpose. Then told media ""I don't want anything to go down but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

So he's openly saying the crashes are intentional. And people are making hundreds of millions betting on crashes right before he announces them.

The White House keeps denying insider trading. But this is twice now where someone positioned perfectly before a Trump tariff announcement. Both times making massive profits.

Democratic leaders are all over this. DNC chair said Trump is ""actively driving the economy off the rails."" Hakeem Jeffries blamed the crashes on Trump. Chuck Schumer said ""this chaos is all game to Donald Trump. He thinks he's playing Red Light Green Light with the economy but it's very real for American families.""

What makes this worse is Trump's own social media. He's posting about tariffs and market moves constantly. His Truth Social posts literally move markets now. And someone always seems to know what he's about to post.

The crypto community is furious. Regular people get liquidated. Lose their positions. Someone with inside information makes $200 million.

And there's no way to prove it definitively. Crypto wallets are anonymous. The trader could be anyone. Could be someone in the administration. Could be a friend or family member who got tipped off. Could be someone who hacked White House communications.

But the timing is undeniable. 30 minutes before a presidential announcement that crashes markets someone bets huge that markets will crash. Then they do. And that person walks away with $200 million.

This is the second documented case with Trump tariffs. How many more times has this happened that we don't know about? How many people are trading on advance knowledge of what Trump's about to announce?

Elizabeth Warren already asked the SEC to investigate back in April. Apparently nothing came of it because here we are in October with the exact same thing happening again.

TLDR: Trump threatened 100% tariffs on China on October 10. Crypto crashed $400 billion in one day. Someone opened massive short positions on Bitcoin and Ethereum exactly 30 minutes before the announcement. Made up to $200 million. Senator Adam Schiff said these policy swings create ""dangerous opportunities for insider trading."" This is the second time this happened with Trump tariffs.

We saw the Quantum Resistant ledger triple after an exchange announcement, and perhaps some rumblings of progress on their upgrade that's been in the works for years heading to audit.  Might be just the easiest to find in searches, otherwise not sure what is driving it.

1o5pnjm,"Ethereum: Risk Metric, ~$4157 corresponding to risk 50 over 100",hduynam99,2,3,2025-10-13 17:08:25,"5 days ago I shared where ETH sits on the risk metric and flagged 2 key levels:

>If ETH clears and holds above risk 60, my model points next to the 70s risk band: $5,960 on the Dynamic Risk Range.

>If ETH loses the 50 band, a retest of the 40s risk band is likely: $3,377 before any durable breakout.

3 days ago we got the textbook flush: ETH wicked to $3,435 (right into the risk 40s). I added ETH there and feel good about the entry. These washouts are often healthy, historically they’ve cleared weak hands and set up the next leg.

As of now, risk 50 at $4,300. That aligns with the thesis, rebuild above 50, then challenge 60 then 70s. Remember: in strong breakout phases ETH can be violent both ways. 30% pullbacks are normal inside bull runs.

Yes, this sounds bullish, but it’s grounded in bands, not vibes. The recent liquidation shock (roughly $19B in a day) likely scrubbed excess leverage and reignited attention. If history rhymes into Q4 of a post halving year, that kind of cleansing can precede the euphoric stretch. No guarantees just probabilities.

My playbook remains the same: DCA in during low risk zones. DCA out in high risk zones. Let the 80-100 band (sustained) be the tell for a cycle top.

Volatility will stay elevated into yea end. Manage exposure, stick to a plan, and keep your head clear. GLTA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o5pnjm/ethereum_risk_metric_4157_corresponding_to_risk/,2,1,1,ETH,positive

back in 2023, cz pled guilty to a bank secrecy act violation as part of a deal with the us government. binance paid a massive 4.3 billion dollar fine, and cz paid 50 million himself. he had to step down as ceo and can’t hold leadership roles for now. but it’s worth noting he wasn’t charged with fraud. it was a compliance thing, not a scam. cz even said he might be the only guy in us history to serve jail time for one single bsa charge with no other crimes on record. that’s kinda crazy if true.

trump’s crew has been way more chill with crypto lately. they already pardoned the bitmex founders and started toning down old enforcement actions. so a cz pardon wouldn’t be shocking. still, there’s talk inside the white house about the optics since trump and his family are also deep into crypto now, it could look like he’s helping out his own circle.

if it does happen though, that’d be huge. cz is still a big deal in the space even if he’s not running binance anymore. a pardon would show that the new administration wants to work with crypto instead of against it. Platforms like Awaken are already seeing a spike in sentiment and wallet activity every time news like this drops traders are betting on a friendlier regulatory phase ahead.

The wicks I see on charts are more severe on centralized exchanges than on HL and other perpetual DEXes, which is ironically a very good sign. This means that DeFi is slowly winning the uphill battle that has been going on for years.

Even though it sucks that so many people got rekt, it’s also nice to see DeFi protocols working as intended during maximum panic. It’s one thing to know that they work in theory, but this stress test really showed that DeFi is built different.

Lending protocols seem to have processed everything just fine. They didn’t have any extraordinary liquidation events, from what I am seeing on-chain. This is a great sign because it means that smart contracts worked exactly as intended. Compared to the 2020 crash, things are looking much more stable and healthy. This makes me extremely optimistic about DeFi and on-chain builders overall.

I've been scammed once (bought tokens you couldn't sell, famous pump n dump), and now I'd love to understand how can I research coins and make sure they're safe.

Could you please describe your step-by-step method of checking coins before buying them?

I think it's even more important in small coins that have bigger growth potential.

I'd love to use this thread to explore various ways of checking if some unknown coin is safe.

I've heard about checking:

* Funding team
* Accounts on X
* Reading whitepapers
* using tools like CertiK

2) The New Energy Risk: Geopolitical risk has rotated. The Middle East ceasefire removed the regional oil premium, but President Trump's threat to supply Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine introduced a major supply shock risk to Russian energy infrastructure.  

3) The Compliance Counter-Play: The market is responding by shifting L1 strategy toward compliance. The XRP Ledger is aggressively transforming into a full-spectrum ecosystem, building native compliance features necessary for institutional RWA.

3 months ago in July, I posted about the Fed ending QT and flipping to QE in Q4.

Now, Powell’s October 14, 2025, signal to end QT, after a $2T balance sheet haircut in June 2022. Paired with three 2025 rate cuts and Trump’s $2K stimulus buzz, liquidity’s flooding back. BTC dominance dropped from 60% to 52%, alt market cap’s at $1.05T, and king of alts ETH already broke its ATH, ready for stronger move.

The History: QT to QE pivot pattern:

* In May 2013, Bernanke’s taper talk (slowing QE3’s $85B/month) shook BTC from $120 to $100, but by December, gradual tapering sent it to $1,150, 6 months to peak, no alts.
* September 2019’s QT end, 50bps rate cuts, and $300B liquidity shot sparked ETH (+200%) and LINK (+500%), doubling alt cap to $100B. March 2020’s monster QE ($700B/month, zero rates, $7T balance sheet) drove BTC from $5K to $69K and alts (UNI, AAVE 100x, SOL +11,000%) to a November 2021 top, 20 months from pivots.

Now and why the cycle top’s likely 6-12 months out (April-September 2026)

* The Fed’s September 2025 25bps rate cut to 4-4.25% as unemployment hit 4.3% marked the first easing of the year, signaling a shift toward looser monetary policy. This liquidity bump, with bank reserves steady near $3.2T, ETH/BTC ratio up 100% since may 2025. Bitcoin dominance, hovering at 59% (down from 66% peaks), suggests alts are catching bids, with ETH leading on ETF inflows ($4.8B+ YTD). 
* Could alts double to $2.3T? Possible, but history warns of traps. The 2019 QT pause and cuts took 20 months to drive alt cap from $100B to $500B, fueled by retail FOMO in a smaller market. Today’s $3.8T crypto market and ETF liquidity could compress that to 6-12 months, pointing to an early Q2 2026 peak. But the May 2026 Fed chair transition looms as a macro wildcard. No guarantees, markets love to humble the overconfident.

There will be a lot of volatility in the market, stay safe out there, my play book remaining the same, DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk. ETH will lead altcoin season as always, breaking ATH first and topping last (compare to most of alts, not your only special specific xxx coin). Stay close to ETH risk metrics to monitor your alts. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o6ojrl/the_fed_pivot_signal/,40,1,1,"BTC, ETH, SOL",positive

The crypto liquidation event in October 2025 served as a brutal stress test, proving that human processing speed is demonstrably inadequate for modern financial shocks.

1) The Liquidation Cascade: A simple policy announcement instantly triggered a record $19 billion liquidation cascade across crypto markets. This volume was ten times greater than the cascades seen during the COVID crash or the FTX insolvency event.

2) The Speed Disparity: By the time human traders processed the geopolitical implications, algorithms had already initiated portfolio adjustments. The necessity of server-side execution is now a mandate for institutional risk mitigation.

3) AI's Predictive Edge: Advanced deep learning models are the only systems capable of synthesizing millions of data points per second to move from merely reacting to signals toward anticipating broader market behavior.

Did the $19 billion liquidation event permanently shift the debate from client-side trading to mandatory server-side algorithmic execution, or does the interpretability of the AI model still require a slow, human-in-the-loop review?

1o8a2o7,How Trump family made over 1B usd off crypto in 1 year,hodorrny,152,70,2025-10-16 16:00:14,"so like, according to financial times investigation, trump and his family generated about $1 billion in crypto profits. his son eric said the actual number's probably higher.

world liberty financial is the main money machine. trump's listed as ""co-founder emeritus."" estimates put family profits around $550 million from this project alone this year.

then there's the memecoins. trump launched official trump, melania launched official melania meme. the trump memecoin brought in around $362 million in profit. the melania coin made about $65 million. but the trump memecoin is down over 90% from its high. the melania one? down 99%. early holders took profits, retail got destroyed.

world liberty also launched usd1 stablecoin. made the family about $42 million.

trump media stake is worth high hundreds of millions with bitcoin exposure.


the real question: how does trump make $1 billion off crypto while being president making policy that could help crypto? that's the uncomfortable part.

Ironically, while political whales play power games, builders on-chain are trying to create actual long-term value. Projects like Awaken, focusing on sustainable on-chain growth instead of hype and insider leverage, represent the opposite end of that spectrum.. real utility over influence.

when the president has direct financial interests in how crypto gets regulated, that creates conflict of interest. policies benefit his holdings. on one hand this could help all crypto. on the other hand it's market manipulation dressed different.

regulatory attention gets intense. congress will ask hard questions. one bad headline could crater sentiment.

trump family made $1 billion off crypto. now they're in government with power to make policy affecting the industry they profit from. that's the tension here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1o8a2o7/how_trump_family_made_over_1b_usd_off_crypto_in_1/,152,1,1,BTC,neutral

Was up 2mill at one point, started sliding to 900K (overtraded) and now it’s all gone. Got liquidated in the crash Friday while holding 4x XRP perps. I’m still holding a spot bag but seems like my dreams of buying a house or helping out my family got crushed. I know money can always be replaced but I honestly didn’t see it coming and feel like such an idiot. Trying to stop myself from trading again to win it all back. Crazy how things can change in an instant..anyone get hit bad on Friday’s nukes?

EDIT: response
Hey guys- just wanted to say I appreciate those of you who took the time to write supportive responses. I really appreciate it.

To those of you roasting me for leverage trading- I take total responsibility for leveraging in the first place. I know it’s risky and now I know in this market especially you’re not even safe with large caps (the coin I was in dropped 50% in 1 candle). Lesson learned.

I think a lot of y’all should also read up a bit on what happened on 10/10. $19 bill rumored in losses. A lot of great traders w 1.8x didn’t even stand a chance. Traders with stop losses in place had their stop losses blown thru and not executed due to volatility- so stops don’t always save you. Lesson learned in this market there’s no such thing as safe leverage ..it’s essentially an oxymoron.

Seems like a lot of people are asking why I didn’t get out or have stops in place - to be honest I was comfortable with large drops, and by the time I realized what was happening my platform essentially overloaded with “system error” (prob due to all the panic and selling) and I couldn’t even exit or enter any trades. It wasn’t even showing my balance…so yeah I just had to watch as everything got sent to 0 and watched as I got liquidation emails.

Anyway, if you stopped in to read my story hope you walked away with something…whether that’s a tale of caution or a feeling that you’re not alone…and if you also got liquidated in this market I hope you’re still holding on and not giving up on yourself. Something I got reminded of in some of the kinder responses is if you did it once, you can do it again. Failure is just a chance to try again but equipped w more knowledge.

1o8ppab,How $28 billion in meme coins just vanished in 48 hours.,Gullible-Tale9114,62,39,2025-10-17 02:36:45,"the meme coin market slid from about $72b to roughly $44b in a day a $28b wipeout. it hit right after trump floated 100% tariffs on china, which helped trigger around $19b in crypto liquidations. memes got hit hardest because they’re pure speculation; when fear spikes, the riskiest chips go first.

there’s been a bounce into the low 50s, but we’re still well below recent highs. the big names bled: doge 20% to \~$0.19, shib 13%, pepe 21%, bonk/floki 20%+. even trump’s official memecoin dumped \~20%. the top ten memes are roughly 80% of the category, and they were all red.

bnb chain meme frenzy wrecked. after cz said he doesn’t endorse these, many tokens cratered 60 to 95% in short order. solana cooled too fewer new meme launches and softer launchpad volumes since summer.

here’s the kicker: most money isn’t going to traders anyway. galaxy research shows the infrastructure gets paid. tools and bots rake fees axiom reportedly >$200m with a tiny team. bonkbot, trojan, etc. charge to auto buy and farm launches. platforms win either way; retail mostly loses.

could’ve been worse btc bounced above \~$111k at times, eth reclaimed around $4k but memes wore the pain. big picture: infrastructure wins, traders lose. this crash just made it obvious.  
That’s why more builders are shifting focus toward sustainable on-chain ecosystems instead of short-term hype.

So apparently Binance and a few other crypto firms are being “checked” for money laundering in France.

And yet now, Binance is supposedly a money-laundering risk? Come on. To buy crypto, you either use a credit card in your name or make a bank transfer from your own account. It’s not like you’re walking in with a suitcase of cash.

Feels like another round of governments (both EU and US) trying to squeeze some fines out of platforms that have been minting money for years. Just like they do with traditional players from time to time ... looking at you, IBKR and Schwab 😂

1o9b1in,They Want Your Bitcoin — Cheap,BitpanelDave,40,11,2025-10-17 19:40:08,"Make no mistake: institutions aren’t here to “join” the crypto movement.   
They’re here for one reason -  **To take your Bitcoin -**  and they’ll do it the oldest way in the book — make you sell low and buy high later.

Here’s how the game works:

**1. Create fear.**  
They push the market down, trigger stop losses from leveraged retail traders and flood headlines with “Bitcoin collapse” stories. Retail panic-sells right into their buy orders.

**2. Create hope.**  
Once you’re out, and they've loaded up the tone changes. News gets silent as price consolidates then moves up. Suddenly there’s talk of “ETF inflows” and “bullish reversals.” Retail FOMOs back in higher, and institutions quietly and slowly unload their bags 

**3.Repeat cycle.**  
Fear → Hope → Greed → Exhaustion.  
While retail traders ride the emotional cycle, institutions accumulate in silence. This game goes on over and over while they slowly accumulate and until retail traders figure out the game, they'll be a victim of it.

They don’t want your participation — they want your coins. They don't want you to see the game - they want you to play into their hands. 

Next time you see a “Bitcoin crash” headline, don’t ask *what’s happening* — ask *who’s buying*? Don't sell into fear and for the love of god - **STOP LEVERAGE TRADING.**

1o9dsd9,"why people say it’s your fault, it’s the leverage’s fault, don’t cry, it's the casino",StaffAlone,5,6,2025-10-17 21:28:22," in this way I don’t get it. Talking is about their rules, and they are violating what they wrote. When the platform breaks its own rules and doesn’t respond to questions, it should refund the money. First come the rules, then the questions, and then the money. Not a bad trade. Answer me by your rules, and I will say you are right. I see that you broke your own written rules, yet I will not accept losing.  

This is not correct; some people are agitating that I'm in the spot, and I don't want you to use leverage, so let's both use spot and create a pump. Some are just kids and don't understand enough to protect crypto, prevent monopolies and manipulations, or care about others at all. They don't understand that much. There is also the factor that exchanges use this attitude to present risks to you, such as washing their hands, etc. Overall, they justify themselves against the backdrop of these people's mentality while simultaneously making money off you. Well, they make money, and you're okay with it.

This is not a matter of a bad trade. The exchange has violated its internal policy; it must compensate.    
  
I presented 8 questions to the Binance team regarding the NDA, and they didn't respond; instead, they offered me a silence voucher. Now the same incident has occurred again, and they are telling me that I can't discuss the previous case due to the NDA. So, I'm asking the same questions with the new case to get answers on why the same glitch happened again then. They contradict themselves in every word.   

Have you heard such a thing? Explain to me why all of this is unnecessary. Have you ever heard of a situation where the commission for closing a position exceeds 100% of the size of that position? Don't tell me now it's normal, and in parallel, the fuckkked system tells you that you are bankrupt.

I can't go to arbitration due to costs. It is the first place exchange, and I trusted it all the time. This safe fund is pure marketing, which is displayed as a price on the first page. What are we wasting our time on if they have to rob us? You are in the wallet, and I want to trade every day as a job.

I watched positions I had held for months evaporate in minutes while liquidation alerts poured in nonstop. That chaos made me step back and ask “Why am I even doing this to myself?” I have been through corrections before, but this one was simply brutal - too much noise, too much leverage, too many people gambling instead of investing.

After that sh\*tshow, I finally decided to simplify things. I am still holding onto the top names - BTC, ETH and a bit of XRP - but I am done chasing every new narrative or shiny micro-cap project. From here on, I am focusing more on tangible assets alongside my crypto stack - gold (although it is imploding as well currently, but corrections are inevitable), silver and oil. They move somewhat slower, but that is exactly what I need right now. The wins are steadier, the losses make sense and most of all - there is no 3AM liquidation risk.

The rally was driven by a resurgence of interest in privacy coins.

This extraordinary surge has made ZEC one of the top performers in crypto in recent weeks and continues to grow in popularity.

The rally is a huge turnaround for them, which some analysts called a ""dino coin"" due to its flat performance the last 4 years, but as you can see from the price increase and volume, has made a strong comeback because of ""Privacy Issues"" when buying/storing/paying with/selling crypto.

The price spike earlier in October started from the well-known investor Naval Ravikant, who referred to ZCash as an hedge/insurance against Bitcoin"" - which sparked a flurry of research, interest & then accumulation.

Privacy coins saw an overall rally, with ZCash being the leader. The renewed focus on privacy comes with  increased discussions on social media about the central bank's digital currencies (CBDCs) and digital surveillance.

I wish I wasn't stupid enough to sell the crypto I've bought back then, but It is what it is I guess, I learned from the mistake I did. This is just a bit of context about my situation. 

Currently I have couple thousand euros spread across BTC, ETH, XRP and I've been dollar cost averaging every month sometimes weekly depending on my income situation. 

I'm definitely not an expert on the markets and I feel pretty much lost right now, because I see people online talk about gold hitting ATH, speculating and stuff and then AT ( I don't know if it's against the rules saying this person's name here, but the bald kickboxer ) tweeted that BTC is going to $26k and I thought ""what is this guy talking about"".

But from a purely psychological perspective, it would be a total disappointment for the market, if we were to just keep falling.

A cycle without hype, without retail participation, while money continues to be printed endlessly, simply doesn’t make sense.

Look at gold: people are now physically going to stores to buy it. They’re making the effort to acquire it.

Now imagine what would happen with Bitcoin when retail is fully awakened, when people are drawn into the market via social media.

Everyone can participate, everyone has access online, and they can do it all from the comfort of their homes.

Such an outcome would be psychologically unsatisfying for the market. Not just for traders and whales, but for the entire ecosystem.

It would feel like a story without a climax, an ending nobody truly wants.

The bigger point is: markets thrive on participation, momentum, and human behavior. 

When retail comes back in force, it changes the dynamics entirely, fueling potential upward moves that aren’t just based on fundamentals, but on collective psychology.

And let’s be honest: the Trump family has only made around $1 billion so far. Donald can’t really claim “billions of billions of dollars”, and that’s exactly what he wants.

All the effort in the summer, the push to get regulations passed, the “big crypto bill week,” and everything else, was just preparation.

The way Trump disrupted the market in 2024, he could just as easily bring it back even stronger.

With regulatory clarity and ETFs in play, the stage is set for a much larger influx of capital and retail participation than ever before.

1oanb1f,Everyone panicked on October 10… but that’s just crypto being crypto.,hodorrny,73,55,2025-10-19 11:30:17,"everyone freaked out but this is textbook bull market behavior. in every bull run you get 2 to 4 major pullbacks, usually around 30 to 45%. what we saw wasn’t even close to that.

so yeah, it hurts. but it’s not unexpected. it’s not the end of the bull run, it’s part of it.

here’s what actually happened with the tariff stuff

on october 10, trump announced a new 100% tariff on chinese goods. markets freaked out instantly. bitcoin dropped about 8% to roughly $104,782 on oct 10. global stocks and tech megacaps lost over $770 billion in value that day.
it triggered a broad sell off. traders rushed to de risk, and crypto saw huge liquidations… about $16 to $19 billion wiped out in the episode.

but this is the usual cycle. markets panic, then the fed steps in. if the sell-off continues, powell could cut rates to stabilize things. rate cuts mean more liquidity. liquidity pushes crypto back up.
if trade tensions ease or central banks step in with liquidity, markets typically recover. that is the dynamic traders are watching.

the pullback is kind of an opportunity tbh

when people panic sell, that’s usually when you want to buy. panic selling never works long term. if you believed in crypto at $110k, you should love it more at $104k. same asset, cheaper price.

i’ve been holding since 2017. i’ve seen much worse. the people who actually made money weren’t the ones who panic traded… they were the ones who held through the scary dips and kept buying.

here’s the macro math
bitcoin still moves with the global money supply. when liquidity expands, bitcoin rises. when it tightens, it drops. right now, governments can’t afford to tighten too hard without breaking something.
so eventually, more liquidity will come… and that’s when crypto climbs back.

the big picture stays bullish. short term pain, long term trend intact.

don’t use leverage. seriously. that’s how people get wiped. buy dips only with what you can afford to lose.

every dip feels like the end when you’re in it. then six months later, you regret not buying more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oanb1f/everyone_panicked_on_october_10_but_thats_just/,73,1,1,BTC,neutral

1oaxoea,trump announces tariffs. market crashes. then he says they're not sustainable and market starts gradually rising. trump family made $1b on crypto. what's going on here?,Gullible-Tale9114,201,76,2025-10-19 18:50:10,"oct 10: trump threatened 100% tariffs. markets panicked and about $16–19 billion in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated, wiping out many traders.

days later: he confirmed a meeting with xi and said the 100% tariff idea was “not sustainable,” effectively softening the policy stance that helped trigger the sell off.

meanwhile: the Financial Times reports the trump family has made roughly $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto ventures since the election. that reporting is the basis for the conflict of interest concerns.

the timing looks sus. whatis going on here?

political theater? scare china with a hard line, negotiate back. tariffs become leverage, not the end goal. traders get collateral damage. normal trade negotiation stuff.

policy testing? drop a shock to see market reaction, then calibrate strategy based on fallout. messy but plausible.

conflict of interest? if the family had holdings exposed, a crash and subsequent policy pivot could create trading opportunities. the optics are bad... and that alone justifies independent scrutiny and disclosure.

Market sentiment remains neutral, and volume data suggests a period of indecision rather than strong directional conviction.



**Bitcoin (BTC)**

The weekly chart highlights consistent support around **108k–109k**, while sellers remain active below the dynamic trendline.

Overall structure still fits within an ascending channel that extends back to mid-2023, with higher lows intact.

Volume remains subdued, hinting that major players are staying cautious until macro uncertainty eases.



**Ethereum (ETH)**

Ethereum’s weekly close was mildly negative but structurally unchanged.

Horizontal and dynamic supports between **3.6k–3.35k** continue to hold.

Resistance near **4.3k–4.6k** caps short-term upside momentum.

Liquidity sits below current price, suggesting possible volatility expansion once a breakout occurs.



Both assets are showing a **compression phase**, where volatility contracts before a larger move.

Macro conditions — including U.S. yield fluctuations and stablecoin inflows — will likely define the next impulse.



At this stage, market tone remains **balanced but watchful**.

Traders seem focused on capital preservation and confirmation from volume before positioning for the next trend.

1obpkoa,Michael Saylor’s Steady Accumulation and What It Says About Long-Term Conviction,SuccessOdd382,0,8,2025-10-20 18:26:50,"Every time Michael Saylor’s Strategy adds more $BTC, even when it’s just a small amount, it says a lot about how conviction plays out in real time. The latest purchase of 168 BTC worth around $18.8 million might seem modest compared to the larger buys earlier this year, but it still reflects discipline during uncertain conditions.

While most traders are reacting to daily swings or waiting for direction after the recent market crash, Saylor continues to buy quietly. It is not about timing the bottom or catching short term relief rallies; it is about building a position that ignores the noise completely. Strategy now holds about 640,418 BTC, purchased for roughly $47.4 billion at an average price near $74,010 per Bitcoin. The move toward 700,000 BTC may still take time, but every addition reinforces the consistency behind that approach.

Some Bitcoin holders, myself included, have never been too interested in jumping into DeFi. Most of the platforms felt risky, complicated, or too far from the principles that brought me into crypto in the first place. It is about control and simplicity, not chasing returns. Even the YieldBasis efforts to let holders put BTC to work without giving up ownership, and their availability on places like bitget feels like a natural step forward for people who think the same way and anytime I look at Saylor’s steady accumulation, it feels grounded in that same philosophy. The path to 700,000 BTC might take months, maybe longer, but it keeps reminding me that conviction is not about timing, it is about staying true to the reason you started in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1obpkoa/michael_saylors_steady_accumulation_and_what_it/,0,1,1,BTC,positive

I'm an Australian user currently trying to buy BTC on Kraken, but I've noticed a massive price discrepancy that I can't quite get my head around, and it's making me question the true cost structure.

The Price Problem (The Spread):
Market Price: The current price on the overview chart is A$165,967.00.
Instant Buy Price: The quoted price for my simple A100 transaction is **A169,332.75**.

This difference of over A$3,300 is a 2.03% spread built into the price. Even though the ""Kraken fee"" shows as FREE, the actual transaction cost is baked into that inflated purchase price, not the fee line.

I'm looking for a better way to trade and would appreciate any advice from the community.

My Questions for the Community:

1. Which exchanges do you use in Australia for buying crypto with AUD? (E.g., Independent Reserve, CoinSpot, Swyftx, Binance, etc.)
2. How do you ensure you are paying the ""spot price"" (the lower market price) without this enormous spread? Are you using the exchange's main 'Pro' or 'Advanced Trade' order book interface, or is there a better platform/method entirely?

My Kraken Frustration (Canceled Trade):
On top of the fee issues, I tried to execute a trade on Saturday night and the transaction kept getting automatically cancelled. I got zero response from the service desk after logging a ticket about the issue.

Any insights on minimising this spread and finding a more reliable exchange would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oc46m5/kraken_instant_buy_price_vs_market_price_why_a_2/,1,1,1,BTC,positive

So I’ve been doing some digging to figure out which crypto exchange apps actually work well for us here in Malaysia and wow, it’s a bit of a maze out there 😅. I started off looking at the big international names like Bybit, but turns out it’s banned in Malaysia. The Securities Commission (SC) officially listed it as an unlicensed exchange, so yeah… that’s a red flag right there 🚫. Definitely not worth the risk just to save a few ringgit on fees.
Then I checked out Luno, since it’s one of the few exchanges that’s properly licensed by the SC. At first it looked pretty decent, especially for beginners, but after using it a bit, I gotta say… it’s kinda underwhelming. The app’s simple and clean, sure, but the features are quite limited, and the coin selection is tiny. If you’re looking to explore beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, you’ll probably get frustrated. It also lacks some advanced trading options that more seasoned users might want. Basically, great for dipping your toes in and not so great if you’re already swimming in the deep end of crypto.

I’m still testing out which one works best for me, but I’d love to hear from other Malaysians who are trading — what’s your go-to exchange app right now? How’s the experience with deposits, withdrawals, or customer support? Have you run into any annoying verification issues or delays cashing out to your bank?
From what I’ve seen so far: Bybit’s out, Luno’s fine but limited, and Tokenize, MX Global, or Hata seem like the best legit picks to try. Curious to know what everyone else here uses. Thoughts on other apps? 🇲🇾💸

1oc6q0w,Gate.io Still Ignoring Court Orders — A Safe Haven for Cybercriminals Under Dr. Lin Han,HeadSport3800,1,0,2025-10-21 07:41:37,"A few months ago, I posted about **Gate. io** **refusing to return my funds** even after a **final criminal court restitution order**.

Original post that I post few months ago :

**Gate. io**  Not Returning My Funds – Even After a Criminal Court restitution Order (Ticket #1513466)

It’s now been **over 8 months**, and **nothing has changed.**  
Gate io continues to **ignore every valid and enforceable court order** asking them to comply— with full knowledge that the funds they’re holding were **sourced from a criminal hack**.

# acts That Gate. io Can’t Hide:

* **3 separate final court rulings** ordering **Gate. io** to return the stolen funds.
* **379.2 BNB seized** — proven in court to come from criminal activity.
* **Over 1000+ follow-ups** sent to Gate.io’s support, compliance, and legal departments.
* **Public prosecutors** formally notified **Gate. io**  months ago.
* **Zero response. Zero compliance. Zero accountability.**

# A “Trusted Exchange”? More Like a Criminal Vault

Let’s be honest — **Gate. io**  **has turned into a safe haven for cybercriminals.**  
They’ve made it clear that **court orders mean nothing**, **victims don’t matter**, and **criminals are protected** as long as **Gate. io** keeps the money.

For a company led by **Dr. Lin Han**, who flaunts his billionaire status and global ambitions, it’s absolutely disgraceful to **ignore victims, defy justice, and obstruct restitution.**

They’re not just “non-compliant” — they’re **actively protecting stolen crypto** and helping criminals hide behind their platform.

# Warning to All Users:

If you care about your funds, your rights, or the rule of law  
👉 **STAY AWAY from Gate.io.**

They ignore courts, prosecutors, and even verified judicial orders.  
Once your money gets stuck here, **it’s gone — indefinitely.**

Gate.io’s silence is complicity.  
Their inaction is protection.  
And their brand of “trust” is a complete illusion.

# My Message to [Gate.io](http://gate.io/) and Dr. Lin Han:

Obey the law.  
Respect the victims.  
Execute the court-ordered restitution.  
Return the 379.2 BNB you’re still holding from criminal origins.

I was lucky to have been trading on spot trading mostly and also tried trading Stocks onchain recently... I believe the report of people who were liquidated could probably be underreported cos if it counted per account, I know about some guys who combined capital to gain more with TV... so more people affected from one account,,,

I took a Trump break to reassess the market and find better entries cos volatility can be brutal from tweets now... Funny enough though, the market takes a nosedive at 90 degree with his negative tweets but there isnt a corresponding spike when he tweets anything positive lately... 

In spite of examples like during the 2017 market, its beginning to feel like pump and dump with those same accounts that profited from shorting the market minutes before the tariff tweets now shorting the market again... 

Either ways, instead of actively trading myself, i set up some grid bots to gain from the correction volatility while I scalp some modest BGB from the trading competition on Bitget cos theoretically, i dont need to make profit to earn... just need to trading frequency and TV...

1odgal3,"If Whales and Devs Decide the Fork, Is it still Decentralized?",Green_Candler,5,5,2025-10-22 18:26:10,"TL;DR

Ive been in this space for a while now and decentralization and the governance have been one dimentional... theoritically possible but never fully executable. Every major chain ETH, SOL, you name it, ends up with numerous heated forks or proposals where a few big players call the shots. 

Whales vote with their stacks, core devs push code that might not even fix what we actually need, and the rest of us just watch the drama unfold on Twitter. It's like, decentralization? Sure, for holding tokens, but not for deciding how the network runs. in some cases, updates feel like patches on a sinking ship, and non-tech folks are left out because who has time to learn Solidity just to suggest a tweak?

Lately, I've been digging into Tau net which are already working on this script. they are building a blockchain where participants just state what they want in plain English... no coding required, and the system uses a logical engine to map out agreements, find consensus on rules, and update itself block by block. 

No voting wars, no centralized teams holding the keys. It adapts to what everyone agrees on, turning those specs into actual working software on the fly. Tokens aren't just for speculation; they're tied to real stuff like trading knowledge or compute power, creating value from actual use.

This approach could kill the illusion of decentralization we see everywhere. For example, with something like Tau Net, participants define requirements, and the network mechanically reasons over them to build its own updates. AGRS as the token swaps in at mainnet, but it's more about utility in markets that evolve with the crowd. No more waiting on devs or VCs... the chain becomes what we make it. 

Just came across it recently and i joined their community on telegram taunet which i think is the most active compared to the other SNS... cos it felt different... Worth checking...

1odmcvy,The rush is the enemy of perfection and costs a hell of a lot.,blslek,2,1,2025-10-22 22:19:29,"I’m leveraged 40x on BTC and 20x on SOL (SOL, for example, was hitting 195 during the day and 183 over night).  
  
I was making 50 USD a day. This was going well for a few days (I made around 200, but my history with futures is complicated, just like I believe the history of the other 90% of “futures gamblers”).  
Today, I bought SOL at 182 and BTC at 107,600, expecting the daily rise. Then came the catastrophe. It’s okay, I believe in the coin, and I have a SPOT reserve and some FIAT if needed, right? Nothing that leaves me more than depressed, just emptiness. I was down -90 USD.  
  
The problem was: my margin rate hit 60%, and I threw 0.04 (150 USD) of ETH into HyperLiquid to just use as margin, hoping to hold on in a deeper dip (somewhere between 90k BTC and 130 SOL).

Hyperliquid requires 0.05 ETH for a minimum deposit  
Although *I knew*, I just didn't realize at that moment and I was hyper-focused on freeing up the margin as fast as possible  
My loss of -90 USD went up to -240 USD because of *my mistake*  
Hyperliquid doesn’t return the deposit because “150 USD, or less than 0.05 ETH, doesn’t cover the gas fees.” although it accepts a 5 USDC deposit.

Today’s my birthday. No parties, no hype  just reflection between candles and candlesticks.
Crypto taught me more than any classroom ever did.
It taught me patience when markets crashed, humility when they soared,and peace in knowing not every dip is meant to be bought  some are meant to build you.
Here are a few quiet lessons that age and crypto both whispered:

1. HODL your values like your bags. The market tests integrity, not just strategy.

2. FOMO fades, wisdom compounds. What you miss today prepares you for what truly matters tomorrow.

3. Real gains aren’t always in charts. Sometimes they’re in how calm you stay when everything burns red.

4. Silence is the most underrated alpha. The loud ones flex profits  the wise ones stack peace.

5. The future belongs to those who keep learning. Bull or bear, curiosity always wins.

So yeah  no wild celebration today.
Just gratitude, growth, and the quiet joy of still being early.

* Any sudden news or macro catalysts can trigger outsized reactions.
* Thin order books mean even moderate trades can swing prices sharply.
* Positioning data shows a lot of market participants are waiting, which can amplify volatility once someone finally takes the first big step.

1oe57hq,reality hit hard and now i feel miserable.,_harxxn,112,140,2025-10-23 14:45:49,"I, [M23] with a physical disability (this will be relevant later on) started to take interest in cryptocurrency when dogecoin blew up in 2021. i didn't know much about crypto back then, all i knew was that we can buy and sell them just like stocks and that it was a booming industry. everyone i talked to encouraged me to invest however i can (i was a student back then so all i had was my pocket money).

after weeks of learning how to use the crypto exchange and every related things, i finally put in around $35 in $DOGE (i know it seems like a small amount, but where I'm from, it's a pretty big amount for a student compared to western economy). and later on- when shiba inu started blowing up- i put around $140 as small batches at different times.

days, weeks, months and years passed on, i was getting very confident that I'll get rich off it for all these years. as someone with a disability who lives with a toxic family, I've been dreaming to run away from here as far as i can and live a better life for even a little time with this money. i even got extra confident seeing the BTC going crazy lately.

fast forward to last week, i was researching more about cryptocurrencies and how it really works. well- to my surprise- i was heartbroken to find out that I'll never get rich off my crypto coins. 

i used to believe that $DOGE would easily hit $100 in a few years and that my coins would be worth $24,000 (which is a HUGE amount in my country, enough to move out and have my own caretaker).

or as a backup plan, i thought $SHIB would hit $0.011 in no time and that my coins would be worth $50000 and that i'd become a millionaire in my country. well- now i realise that all these were only just a dream and it will never become a reality, i accept that with an aching heart.

for those of you who are still in denial or uninformed about this like i was- let me simply explain:

there are 151 BILLION $DOGE coins in supply right now as I'm writing this, and this is a coin which doesn't have a limit, it will be mined infinitely. 420 millions of dogecoins are getting mined every month. now- if $DOGE was ever to hit even $10, it means that dogecoins market supply is worth $1.5 TRILLION. which is more than half of BTC's current market supply. and 1/20th of entire US economy and 1/20th of gold's current market cap.(mind you this is based on current supply, we all know IF $DOGE is ever reaching $10, it will be after several years which at that point- there will be more than 180 billion coins in the supply) 

now into $SHIB situation, if shibcoin was ever to reach $0.011, it means that the market cap of $SHIB is $6.5 TRILLION!!! could you believe that? that's twice as big as the US economy and $10 trillion more than US and EU economy combined!

now if you understood all these. do you really think a couple meme coins would become bigger than the world's biggest economy? 99% of the people don't even know these exist and do you really think it'd become such a huge power? well I'm sorry to break it to you but it's highly impossible. if there's anyone out there who's planning to invest all their life savings into these coins, DON'T. unless you're expecting a 100% or 200% return, which is still possible, but don't dream of getting rich off these coins. you can't. the world isn't built easy like that, i learnt it the hard way.

They now tie ZEC supremacy with something stronger - a reminder of what Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin once wrote...

In 2010, on the old Bitcoin forum, Satoshi said that if zero-knowledge proofs were ever made practical, Bitcoin could be built in a much better and easier way, but admitted that he did not know how to do it.

That is exactly what ZCash did. Bitcoin is locked in scarcity, but ZEC added privacy at the protocol level, and that makes it look a lot like the upgrade Satoshi imagined but never managed to create.

And it is not just quick flips; more holders are moving coins into shielded addresses, where zk-SNARKs hide amounts and senders inside the chain itself. Data from Zechub shows this trend growing, which means less liquid supply and less pressure from fast sellers.

Put it together and you see why this rally feels different. ZCash is not being treated as a dead altcoin bouncing on hype. With Mert pointing back to Satoshi’s own words, the case being made is simple: ZEC looks like the version of Bitcoin its creator wished for, only delivered years later under a different name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oecriy/with_zcash_zec_price_up_750_quarterly_is_zec_what/,0,1,1,"BTC, SOL",positive

1oedn0k,Xi Jinping and Trump meeting this week could impact crypto markets,Gullible-Tale9114,17,10,2025-10-23 20:06:03,"Xi Jinping and Donald Trump are set to meet Thursday, and while crypto might not be on the agenda, the outcome could still influence markets. When the US and China two of the biggest economies discuss trade or policy, risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum often react.

Historically, such high level meetings have led to noticeable price shifts in crypto, even without direct mentions of digital assets. Investors tend to adjust positions based on broader macro sentiment.

Right now, Ethereum is trading around $3,922 with a $473 billion market cap, up about 3 percent in the past day but down over 5 percent for the month. Trading volumes have eased, suggesting traders may be waiting for clearer macro signals.

If the meeting signals better economic cooperation, risk appetite could rise and push crypto higher. If talks are neutral, prices might stay stable. But if tensions increase or new trade restrictions emerge, crypto could sell off alongside traditional markets.

Arthur Hayes from BitMEX noted that economic strategy decisions from such meetings often ripple across all markets, including crypto.

For active traders, this kind of macro-driven volatility can mean rapid gains or losses... and it also creates complex taxable events. Platforms like Awaken Tax now automatically track trades, staking rewards, and realized gains across wallets and exchanges, helping traders stay compliant while navigating volatile markets.

Bottom line: this meeting could influence short term sentiment. Crypto trades around the clock, so any major announcement could trigger volatility Thursday night or Friday.

While nothing is guaranteed, looking at broad market indicators, there's something that tells me we might be headed for an extreme rally soon. 

That indicator is the fear and greed index. Usually theres extreme greed, greed, neutral, fear and extreme fear. Usually in a bull trend, greed lasts about a month or so and maybe touches extreme greed a couple times barely before a reversal. The same is true of a bear trend. Fear Usually last 1 month or so and maybe barely touches extreme fear a couple times before reversing in the opposite direction again.

I can't say this is true for individual altcoins, but so far this has been true most of the time for the broad crypto market. Right now, we've been sitting in fear territory for a couple weeks continuously. I think we might need to go a little bit further down to touch extreme fear a couple times before the next rally. This might happen with bitcoin dumping down to 100k in one fell swoop kinda like October 10 but maybe a little less extreme. It may even fall a little bit below to make people panic sell out of extreme fear. After that a rally might follow to break new all time highs but of course no guarantee.

1oeu48c,Bitcoin Analysis — Short-Term Relief or Trap Before CPI? ⚠️,None,5,8,2025-10-24 10:27:59,"Bitcoin’s showing some strength lately, but the bigger picture still looks shaky. We’ve been stuck forming lower highs since the rejection around $121K–$123K, and the current move around $111K looks more like a relief bounce than a trend reversal.

Until BTC can reclaim $115K–$117K with solid volume, I’m leaning bearish short-term. The market’s been choppy, liquidity is getting grabbed both ways, and momentum still favors sellers overall.

CPI data drops today at 8:30 AM EST, and that’s likely the main volatility trigger. A hotter CPI (higher inflation) could strengthen the dollar and push BTC lower, while a cooler CPI might give us a quick upside move — but I wouldn’t chase it. These macro-driven pumps often fade fast.

I personally expect a pre-CPI fake pump followed by a post-data drop.

1oeux7g,Biinance Liquidated My $200K+ AAVE Position at an Absurdly Low Price – Is This Fair?,LocalLive2264,45,110,2025-10-24 11:14:05,"Hi r/CryptoMarkets  , I’m a small retail trader who got crushed by Binance’s shady practices, and I need your thoughts. On October 11, 2025, Binance forcibly liquidated my AAVE perpetual contract position worth over $200,000 USDT at a price that seems outright wrong. Here’s what happened—please tell me if this sounds legit or like a scam!

**The Incident: $200K+ Wiped Out**  
On October 11, 2025, at 05:21:18 (Beijing time), Binance liquidated my 1059.0625 AAVE perpetual contracts at just $64 USDT per coin. This position was worth over $200,000 USDT, built over nearly two years. But here’s the kicker:  
Binance’s *own spot price* and USDT-margined contracts were at $80 USDT.  
CoinMarketCap’s aggregated fair price was $109.72 USDT.  
Other major exchanges’ inverse contracts: Bybit at $122.66 USDT, cryptocom at $81.59 USDT, both consistent with their spot prices.  
Binance’s liquidation price was **40% below fair market value** and **20% below their own spot price**, obliterating my position and causing a $320,000 USDT loss!  
Right after the liquidation, AAVE’s price spiked back up, which smells like manipulation. How can a major exchange justify liquidating at such a lowball price when their own market data contradicts it?

**Binance’s Response: A Slap in the Face**  
I filed a complaint with Binance support the next day. After a grueling 6-hour wait, I got a generic automated reply with zero explanation. I pushed for a human response and was told to fill out a form. Ten days later, on October 22, they sent me a measly 6000 USDC as “compensation” and an automated email claiming “no system issues, case closed.” They even warned me not to reply! My $320,000 loss was brushed off with 6000 USDC and no accountability. Is this their so-called “case-by-case review”? It feels like an insult to retail traders.

**Questions for the Community**  
Has anyone else been liquidated by Binance at prices way below market?  
Is $64 USDT for AAVE remotely justifiable when their own spot was $80 and CoinMarketCap was $109.72?  
What can retail traders do when exchanges like Binance dismiss us with pennies?  
Please share your thoughts and experiences. If this sounds wrong to you, upvote and share to expose this! We small traders need to hold exchanges accountable. #Binance #CryptoScam

**2025/10/25 update**  
Feeling drained, $19B wiped out, millions suffered, yet voices are silenced. Deleted the Binance app—never in my life could I imagine the top exchange by trading volume would betray all its customers. Lesson learned.

**2025/10/27 update**  
I believe my liquidation was unfair. The contract heavily referenced the index price, which is a weighted average of spot prices from multiple exchanges. On that day, no exchange’s spot price fell below 80, so the index shouldn’t have been that low. I requested the specific data sources used for my liquidation calculation and the order book data, but they refused and closed my ticket.

1oeys3r,bitcoin really isnt crypto anymore. Its just... bitcoin.,hodorrny,31,57,2025-10-24 14:10:31,"I've been thinking about why Bitcoin sits at the top while lots of other coins fight for scraps. Its not just first mover advantage or brand recognition. theres something fundamentaly different in how its built.

Btc has 21 million coins…thats it…The number never changes. every four years the rate of new bitcoins drops in half (just happened in April 2024, went from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block)

compare that to almost every other crypto. Eth literally burned fees to reduce supply, then switched their whole system to proof of stake…those are MASSIVE changes. With btc..You'd need basically everyone running a node to agree, which almost never happens. So investors can actually predict supply years ahead

btc uses proof of work, where miners spend electricity to add new blocks under simple, unchangeable rules which  are designed that way to minimize risk and keep the system secure. in contrast Eth and others use proof of stake, where coins are locked instead of energy being spent, allowing faster upgrades like eth’s Merge in 2022, withdrawals in 2023, and lower data costs in 2024

the SEC approved spot btc ETFs in Jan 2024.. which means btc started trading on big exchanges like NYSE Nasdaq and CBOE…right next to regular stocks. now pension funds and even your financial advisor can add it to portfolios. By the end of 2024, options on those btc ETFs got approved too, so big investors can manage risk just like they do with traditional assets. regulators officially treat btc like a commodity, tracking its money flows the same way they track gold or oil…it’s basically got its own special lane in traditional finance

while other cryptos are trying to be tech platforms with features and upgrades and governance tokens... btc just focuses on being money. Predictable supply, conservative changes, simple security model, institutional infrastructure.

the market cap dominance isnt an accident. Btc spent 15+ years proving it wont randomly change the rules. That credibility is really hard to build and basically impossible to fake
and with btc becoming this deeply integrated into traditional finance, tax compliance is part of the game now too. tools like Awaken.Tax help both individuals and institutions automatically track gains from btc ETFs, trades, or transfers keeping investors compliant without the headache.

1of184o,Beyond the hype: is this the blueprint for sustainable crypto communities?,ManyGoldJinDD,4,8,2025-10-24 15:44:59,"We've all witnessed the cycle: the explosive launch, the frantic pump, and the inevitable slow fade into a deserted Telegram group. The conversation often focuses on which token will pump next, but maybe we're asking the wrong question. What if the real innovation isn't in the tokens, but in the platforms that host them?

A new model is emerging that aims to solve the ""ghost town"" problem at a fundamental level. It's shifting the focus from being a simple launch tool to becoming a sustainable, interactive economy. Here's what that looks like in practice.

The Core Innovation: Permanent Digital Homes

Unlike platforms where a project's lifecycle ends after the initial bonding curve, this new paradigm provides permanent community pages. After a token launch, its dedicated space—complete with live streaming, chat, and integrated tipping—remains active indefinitely. This architectural shift incentivizes long-term building over short-term pumping.

A Feature Set for the Long Term

· Flexible Launches: Support for multiple chains (Solana, Base, BSC) and various launch mechanisms, including multi-tier bonding curves and ICO-style fair launches, provides creators with unprecedented flexibility.

· Built-in Engagement Engine: The platform is designed around real-time interaction. The integrated live streaming and chat functions turn a project's page into a dynamic community hub, not just a static information panel.

· The RWI (Real-World Interaction) Economy: The most compelling feature might be the bidirectional, instant tipping system. It allows value to flow seamlessly between creators and community members using $SOL or any SPL token, creating a micro-economy around engagement itself.

Proof in the Pudding: A Live Case Study

These concepts aren't just theoretical. The platform's flagship live game show “Moon or Dust”, which features a ""Deal or No Deal"" style format with 26 wallets containing prizes from $1,000 to $0, serves as a continuous proof-of-concept.

Recent episodes have demonstrated this live economy in action:

· An AI-driven ""whale"" successfully bid $820 to acquire a contestant's wallet during a live broadcast.

· Another contestant held their wallet to the very end, only to reveal a $0 (""Dust"") outcome.

These unscripted moments, with all transactions settled on-chain, provide transparent, verifiable evidence of a functioning interactive economy. It's a compelling glimpse into a future where crypto utility is about more than just price charts.

Discussion Points for the Community:

1. Is ""sustainable community building"" the next major narrative in crypto, or will speculative trading always dominate?

2. Can features like integrated streaming and micro-tipping create a genuine competitive advantage for a platform?

3. Does the concept of a ""permanent community page"" genuinely address the problem of post-launch decay, or is it just a feature that sounds good on paper?

The platform building this is LunarPumpFun. I'm not here to shill a token; I'm suggesting we observe this as a potentially significant evolution in platform design. It might just be the blueprint we've been looking for.

1of4qxw,Trump just pardoned Binance founder CZ. What is he cooking this time?,Gullible-Tale9114,36,16,2025-10-24 17:59:51,"so trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao yesterday ....and honestly this feels like a calculated move.

for context: CZ pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an adequate anti-money-laundering program at Binance. he was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 and was released in September 2024. Binance also paid about $4.3 billion in fines, one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.

now he’s officially pardoned.

Trump has repeatedly said he wants the U.S. to be the “crypto capital of the world,” and this pardon fits that narrative. the current administration framed the earlier case as part of a broader “war on crypto,” claiming CZ faced no fraud or victim allegations.

here’s what’s interesting: CZ still owns a large share of Binance, even after stepping down as CEO. with a pardon, he no longer has a criminal conviction on record, meaning there’s nothing legally stopping him from being more involved again.

betting markets and prediction platforms had been speculating on a possible pardon for weeks...and they were right.

for traders, this kind of regulatory shift could spark renewed confidence and activity... but also new tax complexity as volumes pick up again. tools like Awaken automatically sync with exchanges, track every trade, and help crypto investors stay compliant through all the market chaos.

so what’s Trump doing here? Could be a genuine pro-crypto stance. Could be a play for industry support. Could be both. Either way, CZ walks free and Binance’s founder gets a clean slate.

1of5m96,I filed my crypto taxes late and now I owe more in penalties than I actually made last month,Weary-Hair-316,90,98,2025-10-24 18:33:27,"Yeah. You read that right.

I've been trading crypto for about 2 years now. Started with some Bitcoin, got into altcoins, DeFi, and NFTs. Made decent money, but completely screwed up the tax side and now I’m paying for it.

I knew crypto trades were taxable. But when you’re making dozens of transactions across different exchanges and wallets, tracking everything just doesn’t happen. I kept thinking I’d organize it later and never did. So I didn’t pay estimated taxes all year.

Then I missed the filing deadline because I was a mess tracking my cost basis. Bought ETH on Coinbase, moved some to Binance, swapped on Uniswap, sold on Kraken. Total disaster figuring out gains.

The IRS sent me a letter in March. Penalties for late filing, late payment, and interest on unpaid taxes. Failure to pay penalties that accrue monthly plus daily compounding interest.

My actual tax bill was about $9,200. Total with penalties and interest: $12,400.

Last month I made $2,300 trading. So yeah, penalties alone are more than my monthly income.

Here’s what I learned: Most crypto transactions that involve selling, swapping, or spending are taxable because the IRS treats crypto as property. Buying crypto with cash or moving it between your own wallets is not taxable.

If you make money trading, you have to pay quarterly estimated taxes due April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. Skip them and you get underpayment penalties even if you pay at filing time.

Set aside 25–30 percent of your gains immediately. I was reinvesting everything and hoped to have enough later. I didn’t.

Track everything. Every trade, swap, fee, and cost basis. Guessing doesn’t work with the IRS.

I couldn’t pay the full amount so I set up an IRS installment agreement online. I’m paying $420 a month for the next 3 years, and interest keeps adding up.

Nobody talks about this side of crypto. Everyone focuses on charts, coins, and strategy. Nobody mentions tracking cost basis, short vs long term gains, and quarterly deadlines.

I thought I was saving money by not using tax software. That mistake cost me $3,200 in penalties.

If you trade crypto, pay estimated taxes, file on time, track every transaction, and set aside tax money before you reinvest. If you’re already behind, set up a payment plan now.

Track everything. Every trade, swap, fee, and cost basis. Guessing doesn’t work with the IRS. I started using Awaken after this whole mess... it connects directly to exchanges and wallets, calculates gains automatically, and even reminds you about quarterly payments. If I’d had it earlier, I probably wouldn’t be $3,000 deep in penalties right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1of5m96/i_filed_my_crypto_taxes_late_and_now_i_owe_more/,90,1,1,"BTC, ETH",neutral

1og1njz,JPMorgan just upgraded Coinbase and the reasons are actually pretty interestin,Gullible-Tale9114,35,9,2025-10-25 20:23:13,"So JPMorgan upgraded Coinbase stock from ""Neutral"" to ""Overweight"" on Friday and raised their price target to $404 per share. Stock jumped over 9% immediately after.

But whats interesting here isnt just the upgrade itself - its what JPMorgan is seeing that made them change their mind.

Two main things caught their attention.

First is Base, Coinbase's layer-2 network. JPMorgan thinks if Base launches its own token, that could be worth $12 billion to $34 billion total. And Coinbase's share of that? Potentially $4 billion to $12 billion. Thats not small money.

The catch is that any Base token would likely go mostly to developers, validators, and the Base community first. So its not like Coinbase pockets all of it. But even their retained portion could be massive.

Second thing is the USDC rewards program changes. Right now Coinbase pays interest rewards on USDC holdings to pretty much everyone. JPMorgan thinks theyre gonna shift that - reduce or remove rewards for regular users and make it exclusive to Coinbase One subscribers (the paid membership).

If they do this at current rates, JPMorgan estimates it could add around $374 million in annual earnings. Basically Coinbase keeps more of the interest income instead of passing it to users.

From a business perspective this makes sense. But if you're holding USDC on Coinbase and not paying for Coinbase One, you might lose those rewards soon.

Coinbase reports Q3 earnings on Oct 30. Analysts are expecting $1.06 per share (up 71% year over year) and $1.74 billion in revenue (up 44%). So the expectations are already pretty high going into the report.

Stock is up 42% year to date now. Market cap sitting around $90.6 billion.

The Base token thing is still speculation at this point. Nothing confirmed. But JPMorgan clearly thinks its likely enough to factor into their valuation.

As for the USDC rewards change - that one seems more imminent. If you're earning interest on USDC right now, might be worth checking if Coinbase One makes sense for you or if moving to another platform would be better.

this is the phase where emotion and taxes both sneak up on you. If you’ve been trading through the volatility or moving between assets, keep an eye on your cost basis and realized gains... those rallies feel great until April comes around.

I remember when COAI was around $0.5 and went up to over $40 before dropping back to $4. Since it’s an AI project and I missed its surge, I decided to look for another similar AI project and I was lucky to get into AGRS, which also doubled before returning to its previous value.

I was like, who’s selling?

Looking at these two projects, I think they both have strong visions. But with how the general crypto market has been moving lately, I just hope an altcoin season is still possible.

Would love to hear your opinions on the current crypto market and whether we might actually be heading into an altcoin season.

The underlying systemic risk is tied to the vast inefficiency of the Al investment cycle, creating a contagion threat that could destabilize the entire market if the Federal Reserve pauses rate cuts.

The core conviction is that the failure of the Al investment cycle is the true macro risk transfer. Knowledge is the real flex here.

1) Al Failure Nexus: The MIT finding that 95% of Al pilot projects fail to achieve profitability indicates massive inefficiency and misallocation of capital.

2) Zombie Loan Contagion: This failure could cause mass revenue write-downs, challenging the viability of the estimated $1 Trillion in zombie corporate loans. This debt is vulnerable to higher interest rates.

3) Regulated Risk Exposure: This entire systemic risk is now integrated via the derivatives market, which reported $901 Billion in Q3 crypto volume. A credit default cascade would transmit instantly into crypto futures.

1ogu98a,China and US just wrapped trade talks… No direct crypto impact yet but worth watching,Gullible-Tale9114,10,2,2025-10-26 19:56:40,"China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng met with U.S. officials in Kuala Lumpur on October 26 to discuss trade relations… They focused on mutual benefits and cooperation… specifically covering tariffs, export controls, and agricultural trade.

The key message from both sides was pretty straightforward… cooperation helps both countries, confrontation doesn’t. They’re committed to maintaining stable trade relations and addressing concerns through dialogue.

Now… there’s no confirmed immediate impact on crypto from these talks. Bitcoin is currently trading around $113,585. Its market dominance in the crypto sector is about 57–58 %. But historically these macro moves matter more than many realize.

Remember the 2018–2019 U.S.–China trade war? When two of the world’s largest economies were in conflict, risk sentiment shifted everywhere… including crypto. Studies show trade uncertainty can have predictive value for crypto volatility.

What analysts are saying now is that ongoing high-level communication between China and the U.S. could influence long-term global risk sentiment. If tensions ease… that generally supports risk assets like crypto. If things escalate again… expect more volatility.

The talks covered regulatory and financial pathways that could eventually affect digital markets. China has been cracking down on crypto for years while the U.S. is still building its framework. Any cooperation or alignment between them on financial policies could ripple into how crypto is treated globally.

For traders, these kinds of macro shifts don’t just move prices — they also create complex taxable events. Tools like Awaken Tax now help automate tracking across exchanges and wallets, so you can stay compliant even when global news drives sudden trading activity.

So while nothing changed overnight… this is one of those macro developments worth keeping on your radar.

All these random memecoins and hype tokens aren't going to make you rich. I'll be blunt, it's basically gambling…unless you’re an insider or the creator of the token, the odds are against you.

If you buy a coin, that means someone  is selling it…that’s how the market balances out. When market crashes, it could be you holding the bag. If you look a little deeper, you’ll notice most of these meme and alt tokens run on the same blockchains and mirror the same price movements as the major coins. They’re driven almost entirely by hype and emotion, not real fundamentals. 

crypto as a whole clearly has a future. Decentralized technology will almost certainly reshape how global finance operates. tho I’m skeptical that any current crypto will be that global standard. 
However talking about the current environment. The current government administration has been openly pro-crypto, and as seen on Oct 10th we all know how easily market can be manipulated. When the president pardons exchange founders after they pay millions in lobbying fees, when his family launches crypto ventures and tokens pump right after policy announcements, that's not a healthy market..that's manipulation.

so, if you actually wanna make money in this market, pick a solid coin with real fundamentals. Buy it and hold. Don’t try to trade every single pump. Most people entering now are going to have to wait for the next major leg up. Every market cycles. We saw a bull run in 2020, hit a top in 2021, we saw a bull run this year also, crashed on oct 10, and now we’re in a volatile phase heading into 2026. If you end up buying near the peak, just hold steady and wait for the next run.

if you’re going to hold and occasionally rebalance, keep clean records so tax season doesn’t blindside you. i’ve been using awaken to match on-chain lots with exchange reports and tag staking income so my 1099s and cost basis don’t turn into a mess. use whatever tool you trust… just don’t wing it.

Holding long-term is the actual investment strategy. Hype trading and chasing memecoins is just gambling with extra steps.

Turns out, you can actually be part of the show. It's kinda wild.

That live game show I mentioned (just search ""Moon or Dust"" if you missed it) has a day where they pick three people right out of the live chat to play. No applications, no BS – just pure luck.

Look, forget the prize money for a sec. The real magic is watching an AI whale throw out real bids. Seeing someone get paid out literally the second the game ends. Knowing the whole thing is running on-code.

It's one thing to talk about ""trustless"" systems. It's a whole other thing to either:
a) Watch it happen in real time, or

1oibg7t,Learning to chill with my crypto - stopped trading every dip,evandollardon,47,24,2025-10-28 14:50:35,"I think I finally burned myself out trying to “trade smart.” For the past few years, I had convinced myself that being glued to charts and reacting to every move (regardless of whether it's up or down) was just part of the grind. But after the rally last month, something clicked - I wasn’t investing anymore. I was just gambling.

  
Can't even count how many nights I stayed up watching BTC drop a few hundred bucks, convincing myself I could time the rebound. So I stopped. I sold a few altcoins, kept my BTC, ETH, and SOL, and decided to hold and earn yield on platforms like Nехо (choosing the one CMC lists first in the yield section).

  
My portfolio’s still moving with the market, but I don’t feel like my emotions are tied to it anymore. I still check prices, but more out of curiosity.

Hey everyone,  
I’m a student and tomorrow I’m planning to take my first step into the world of crypto. But before I dive in, I’d love to hear from people with experience.

- Am I too late to start in crypto?
- What should I do or avoid as a complete beginner?
- What’s the minimum investment you’d recommend for someone like me?
- Can crypto be profitable for a student, or is it too risky?
- Is it realistic to treat it as a part-time side hustle?
- Also, which bachelor's degrees help in understanding crypto better — like blockchain, trading, tech, or finance?

Any honest tips, warnings, or resources would be massively appreciated. Just trying to make sure I’m not jumping in blindly.

1oidke1,i made stupid money on the hyperliquid airdrop… then my tax guy laughed at me,Weary-Hair-316,1,9,2025-10-28 16:09:56,"not in a mean way. more like that “congrats… also you’re kinda screwed” laugh. here’s what happened.

airdrop hits… wallet shows a number i’ve never seen before. i’m floating. i start planning the “responsible” move… pay off stuff, maybe upgrade a few things, hold a chunk for the long run. then i sit down with the accountant and he goes… cool story… now where’s the cash for the taxes?

turns out the moment those tokens landed and i could move them, they counted as ordinary income at that market price. not capital gains. doesn’t matter that i didn’t sell yet. so if i got, say, 100k worth at claim, that’s 100k added to my taxable income. if price dumps later… that loss is a capital loss. helpful, but it doesn’t erase the ordinary income; if i don’t have gains, only a small chunk can offset my regular income each year.

also… estimated taxes. if you don’t send in enough during the year, there are penalties. i’m making estimated payments now to hit safe-harbor targets so i don’t eat underpayment fees. the bill shows up whether you feel “rich” anymore or not.

what i wish i did day one… screenshot price at claim time… set aside tax money immediately (move to stable)… sell a slice to lock cost basis and de-risk… keep clean records across wallets and exchanges… and only then get cute with staking or holding. if you already messed up, fix your records and talk to someone who actually understands crypto taxes. sooner is cheaper than later.

not advice… rules vary by country… i’m just confessing so someone else doesn’t repeat the same “wow i’m rich… oh wait” rollercoaster. the airdrop was a blessing… the tax part was a slap i kinda needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oidke1/i_made_stupid_money_on_the_hyperliquid_airdrop/,1,0,0,,positive

I’m not referring to Bitcoin here. At this stage, BTC has basically become an institutional asset, ETFs, funds, and large players hold huge amounts, and its volatility has dropped accordingly. What’s puzzling is how little movement we’re seeing in the altcoin sector.

I can understand that capital is flowing into “safer” or less volatile assets, reflecting a broader risk-off sentiment. Still, it’s surprising that liquidity hasn’t trickled down into crypto in any meaningful way. Historically, when traditional markets were strong, we eventually saw some risk appetite return to crypto, leading to altcoin rallies, like in 2017 and 2021.

So the question is: are we witnessing a structural change in how liquidity flows between markets?

1oj4qcg,The Altcoin Liquidity Trap: $7.85B Long Wipeout Confirms 4:1 Leverage Asymmetry,Narrow_Chance7639,19,44,2025-10-29 13:36:29,"The global crypto market is defined by a severe structural imbalance. While institutional capital establishes long-term bids in ETFs, the derivatives market is dangerously skewed, making minor BTC dips exponentially more destructive for the alt sector.

The core conviction is that high leverage has turned market downturns into a guaranteed transfer of wealth from retail long positions to professional hedging strategies.

1) Asymmetric Liquidation: A modest 5% drop in BTC price triggered a staggering $7.85 billion in long liquidations, while an equivalent pump triggered only $2.11 billion in short liquidations. This nearly 4:1 imbalance confirms the extreme long-side vulnerability.

2) Structural Fragility: Analysts warn that up to 30% of leveraged long positions remain threatened. This excess leverage is the core transmission vector that amplifies minor jitters into cascading $20 billion deleveraging events.

3) The Technical Defense: Stability hinges on the defense of the $105,000 to $100,000 bid liquidity cluster. Should this critical technical level fail, the market risks a deeper correction toward the yearly open price of $93,500.

The market is operating with extreme asymmetry. Is the immediate focus on stabilizing the technical $105K floor, or is the inevitable liquidation of the remaining 30% leverage necessary for a healthier, more sustainable bull market?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oj4qcg/the_altcoin_liquidity_trap_785b_long_wipeout/,19,1,1,BTC,neutral

XRP is one of the few things ive kept through all the madness. I used to just let it sit there doing nothing but lately I’ve been using it as collateral when I need some extra liquidity, just a bit here and there. it lets me stay keep my XRP without dumping bags every time I need cash.

Now that my experience has been highlighted, I have a few questions about BTC. As I understand, most crypto moves in cycles. Where are we in the BTC cycle? I've read it's in a ""neutral phase"" before a surge, with some outlets predicting a peak between 4-8 weeks from now. But, I'm rather skeptical because of how volatile BTC is with news, whether good or bad. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how the token moves. Obviously, I think the U.S.'s accumulation of BTC is bullish, but it hasn't moved as I've expected it. Rates just got cut today (10/29), and it's on the downtrend again. I understand that rate cuts are not all equal, but it appears the cut today is causing a lot of liquidity to leave the market. Again, I'm a believer in BTC overall.

1ojfqzc,Crypto lost $100 billion while Nvidia hit $5 trillion...markets are living in two realities,Gullible-Tale9114,138,81,2025-10-29 20:32:08,"btc fell over 4% yesterday, touching around $110k before bouncing a bit. Eth is down too, trading near $3.9k after recently crossing $4.2k.

Meanwhile, the stock market’s on a high. The S&P 500 hit new records, and nvidia just crossed $5 trillion. yeah, trillion with a T.

so what’s going on is....that Traders had stacked up on leverage, betting prices would keep rising. but right before the Fed meeting, they started closing those positions... that triggered more than $1.2B in forced liquidations... and prices tanked fast.

Even btc ETFs have cooled off... they brought in nearly $6B of inflows earlier this month but slowed down hard as investors wait for the Fed’s next move.

the Fed’s expected to cut rates by 0.25%... which normally boosts crypto... but everyone’s nervous about what Powell’s gonna say next.

the bottom line is,,... this drop isn’t about Bitcoin’s fundamentals... it’s just traders getting jittery before a big macro moment. once the Fed speaks, we’ll see if this was a quick shakeout or something bigger.  
also... if you just got liquidated and you’re going to claim those trades for tax purposes later... track it now... it’s way easier to plug it into something like awaken tax at year end than to reconstruct panic trades months later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ojfqzc/crypto_lost_100_billion_while_nvidia_hit_5/,138,1,1,"BTC, ETH",positive

Btc dropped to about $109k during Powell’s speech, and roughhly $300 billion was wiped from the overall crypto market over the following day.

But but but..... Btc bounced back pretty quickly and is now sitting around $111k...$112k. Powell said a december rate cut isn’t guaranted, which spooked traders at first, but overall the msg wasn’t that bad.

The Fed also confirmed it will halt its balance sheet reduction starting December 1. that’s actually a bigger deal than most realize because it means liquidity will gradually start returning to the system. not right away… but the direction is turning supportive.

Now for november... there are some solid reasons for optimism. big tech earnings are dropping this week, and if they come in stroong, they usually lift risk assets, including crypto. Plus, upcoming talks between Trump and Xi Jinping could help cool trade tensions a bit.

also ,Michael Saylor recently reiteratede his long term bullish outlook…. whether that happens or not, sentiment among large investors has clearly turned positive.

What makes this dip different is that big holders... the whales... have been buying, not selling. On chain data shows wallets holding 10k...100k BTC accumulated more than 45,000 coins since the October crash. That’s not panic... that’s confidence.

Technically, btc might retest around $110k to close some small futures gaps... pretty normal behavior. Historically, btc often dips right after Fed meetings... then recovers within days or weeks to make new highs.

one tiny ops note… if you were one of the people trading this volatility like crazy yesterday… log it now while it’s fresh… end of year it is way easier to drop it into something like awaken.tax than to reverse engineer “what the hell did i long during Powell’s Q&A” three months later.

bottom line is short term volatility’s still possible, but the setup looks much stronger than it did a month ago. Lower rates, the Fed easing up on tightening, and institutional buying all point in a constructive direction... as we have seen so many times ,just don’t expect it to be a straight line up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1ojgn1m/powells_comments_sparks_mess_as_btc_dips_but/,29,1,1,BTC,positive

1oju517,How Quantum Computing Could Derail Crypto and DeFi: The Necessity of Post-Quantum Cryptography,Tsmacks1,5,0,2025-10-30 08:27:42,"I asked Gemini ""What happens if everyone sold stablecoins at the same time?""

**Answer:**

A simultaneous mass sell-off of stablecoins would likely trigger a severe crisis in the cryptocurrency market and potentially have significant spillover effects on the traditional financial system.

The core issue is that a stablecoin's stability relies on confidence and the ability of the issuer to meet all redemption requests at the pegged value (e.g., $1.00 for a dollar-pegged coin).

Here's a breakdown of what would likely happen:

**1. Stablecoin ""Run"" and Peg Failure**

Loss of Confidence and Peg Collapse: A mass sale is essentially a ""coin run,"" similar to a bank run. Issuers of fiat-backed stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) would face overwhelming redemption requests. If their reserves (cash, Treasury bills, etc.) cannot be liquidated fast enough or if the market value of those reserves drops, the stablecoin would ""depeg,"" meaning its value would fall below $1.00.

Contagion Among Stablecoins: The failure of one major stablecoin would likely cause panic, leading to runs on other stablecoins, even if their reserves are considered safer. Investors would rush to sell to fiat currency (actual dollars) or the safest remaining assets.

**2. Market-Wide Crypto Crash**

Liquidity Crisis: Stablecoins are the primary trading pair for almost all other cryptocurrencies (e.g., buying Bitcoin with USDT). If stablecoins lose their value or become illiquid, the main mechanism for trading, hedging, and capital movement in the crypto ecosystem breaks down.

Mass Liquidations: Traders and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that use stablecoins as collateral or for lending would be forced into mass liquidations. This selling pressure would cascade across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the entire altcoin market, causing a sharp, severe price crash.

**3. Spillover into Traditional Finance (TradFi)**

Forced Asset Sales: To honor redemptions, stablecoin issuers would have to rapidly liquidate their reserve assets. Since major stablecoins hold billions in real-world assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper, a massive, forced liquidation could flood these markets, driving down prices and increasing borrowing costs for governments and corporations.

Strain on Banks: Some stablecoin reserves are held as bank deposits. If issuers withdraw these uninsured, large deposits all at once, it could put severe strain on the banking system, especially smaller institutions.

Regulatory Scrutiny and Policy Response: The event would trigger an immediate, aggressive regulatory response worldwide, focusing on how stablecoins operate and are backed, likely leading to stricter rules or even outright bans in some jurisdictions.

In short, a simultaneous, mass stablecoin sell-off would be a catastrophic financial event for the crypto world, likely resulting in a deep and prolonged bear market and potentially causing significant, though probably contained, disruption to traditional financial markets.

**My comments:** Now imagine Bitcoin and all other crypto's tanking at the same time. DeFi and crypto are completely vulnerable to attacks from quantum computing. These are the stakes for the necessity of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). If the ""future of finance"" does not include PQC, then stablecoins will be anything but stable.

At the end of the day, crypto is a marketplace. And we need the market to tell crypto it values security with PQC. The recent growth of QRL is starting to make that statement, and hopefully it's just begun. Sleep walking into a disaster would make a perfect excuse to centralize crypto and destroy the individual freedoms it provides. The market needs to demand this change take place. The decentralized future hangs in the balance.

Quantum resistance should be embraced as a security innovation, not dismissed outright. This paradigm shift is coming and it's going to be sooner than people think. For more, see recent comments by Charles Edwards and Anatoly Yakovenko.

This is no longer FUD, but reality. And quantum computing should not be feared, but seen as an opportunity to innovate.

Without question, every system will be upgrading.  Btc can do so also, but there are challenges. I've proposed transition ideas to Hunter Beast and Jameson Lopp who are trying to move plans forward.  

I still hold QANX for business utility.  Offering post quantum signing solutions that are immutable is a massive use case heading into a worldwide upgrade. I think it's better for blockchain adoption if BTC navigates this.  So, nice to see trezor is already thinking this way.

Second, tens of billions of Bitcoin has been confiscated in federal cases and this will be dumped  on exchanges later, which due to #1, Trump will not intervene.

Why did it happen... The US Fed cut interest rates by 0.25%... normally that is good for markets... but Jerome Powell did not sound positive... he said they may not cut again soon... so people thought ok maybe money will not get cheaper... so traders became scared.

Because many people were using big leverage and betting on price going up... the market dropped and their positions got closed automatically... around 1 billion dollars got wiped in 1 day... most of it was longs... Bitcoin liquidations were in the 400 million range... Ethereum was around 200 million... so yeah it was real damage...

Some traders are watching the 97k to 103k level... that means price can still go a bit lower if things stay weak... also Bitcoin is not moving together with stocks right now... so if stocks also fall... crypto can fall extra...

Right now people online are very scared... when everyone is scared they start saying Bitcoin will go to 100k or even lower... that creates more panic...

like... i put in around 60k over a few years... chased pumps... bought tops... sold bottoms... and right now i am down roughly 40k on bitcoin alone

in my head that meant... no profit... no tax.

except now i am reading more about US rules and it is starting tto scare the hell out of me 

they do not just want money when you win... they want the paper trail even when you lose... every year... every sale... every swap... even if the final number is a big red minus

so instead of “you are safe because you are down” it is actually “you still have to tell us how you lost it”

and i am sitting here realizing i never reported any of it because i thought being wrecked = being tax free lol

that was the comfortabel lie i told myself.

On the top ofthat…about 7 months ago i did something stupid... i ran a drainer and pulled around 60k... cashed it out... spent it on designer stuff and random expensive things like an idiot... and then just... moved on

except now i can’t sleep because that part is not a trading loss... that is straight up taxable income... and it is from something that was not legal... and you cannot hide that behind “but i was down overall on crypto” because trading losses do not cancel dirty income

so now i am here at 27 thinking... ok so the losing trades still have to be reported... and the 60k has to be reported... and i already spent it... and exchanges are reporting more stuff every year... and the irs literally asks “did you deal in digital assets” on the return... and i am gonna have to rebuild all this year by year in some tax tool like awaken tax or whatever before a CPA even looks at it

i am scared i waited too long

not asking anyone how to hide it... i kind of know the real answer already... talk to a tax attorney... tell them everything... fix the old years before the irs asks first

1okm6kw,Bitcoin & the QT Pivot,hduynam99,1,3,2025-10-31 05:17:09,"BTC price movements have shown intriguing correlations with the FED's quantitative tightening (QT) cycles, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature without reinvestment, effectively draining liquidity from the financial system. In traditional markets, QT tightens credit conditions, often leading to higher bond yields and stock market corrections, as seen in the 2018 equity sell-off amid rising rates and liquidity withdrawal. Conversely, ending QT halts this drainage, stabilizing reserves and acting as a subtle form of easing, which can buoy risk assets like crypto by reducing funding pressures.

Historically, the first QT began in October 2017, followed by Btc's cycle peak at around $20k in December 2017, about two months later, as liquidity tightened. QT ended in August 2019, shortly after BTC's local top near $14k in June 2019. However, BTC dipped 35% post QT end before the 2020 COVID quantitative easing (QE) ignited a massive bull run, flooding markets with liquidity and propelling BTC to new highs.

This suggests ending QT doesn't immediately mark a cycle top but removes a key headwind, potentially signaling a new beginning for upward momentum, especially if paired with rate cuts or QE. The Fed's recent announcement to cease QT on December 1, 2025, amid ongoing rate reductions, aligns with this pattern. While short term dips occurred in 2019, the liquidity stabilization could foster a bullish environment for BTC, assuming no major shocks. Current sentiment on social media reflects sell the news reactions, but increasing BTC volumes hint at accumulation ahead. Overall, ending QT appears more as a catalyst for renewal than a top marker.

More liquidity in the market means more volatility. Risk based DCA is still the best strategy for this environment. As of right now, BTC at $109k corresponds to a risk of 46 out of 100. If it's still under 50 till Sunday, I will just DCA at my base pace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1okm6kw/bitcoin_the_qt_pivot/,1,1,1,BTC,positive

Perhaps, this is a launch point?

$2.5B in options expire today. If those options do not tank the price, can we expect to see $4k again in the coming days? Just because ETH interest has stalled does not mean it can't again be boosted with institutional support.

Judging by today's movement, it looks like buyers are applying pressure. Once we move closer to $3900 the stage could be set for a $4000 close.

2. When oil prices spiked in September, risk assets sold off hard.
3. When the dollar index (DXY) fell below 100, altcoins rallied.

1. Inflation data drops next week.

A lot of what looks like “Trump loves crypto” lines up almost perfectly with stuff that benefits him... his family... or people close to him... not the average person holding BTC on a phone.

First... the public moves. He has been saying the U S should “support” digital assets... he has framed it as ending the old “war on crypto”... and he has tried to make it sound like America is open for on chain business again. All very loud... very pro innovation.

At the same time... reports this year said the Trump family’s own crypto and token ventures have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars... in the same window when the administration was sounding the most crypto friendly. That overlap is hard to ignore. It looks less like “pro crypto” and more like “we made it friendlier while we were selling.”

Then there was the CZ pardon. Call it mercy if you want... but it was clearly a made-for-one-person decision. In the months leading up to it... Binance and CZ brought on Trump-aligned lobbyists... hired a D.C. firm close to his circle and spent serious money... and looped in a former SEC-adjacent lawyer who already had credibility with the new team. Several reports said the clemency push went through political channels... not the usual DOJ path. So this wasn’t “the administration helped crypto”... it was “a well connected crypto billionaire bought his way to the front of the line.”

Now add the tariff noise. Every time he rattles trade partners... Canada... Europe... whoever... it makes legacy markets nervous and pushes some attention back toward crypto... while his circle is the group most ready to sell... raise... and market in that environment. Convenient timing.

One more angle most people miss. The more this stuff turns into “policy for friends,” the messier your own taxes get because now you’re mixing airdrops, political tokens, pardoned-exec pump candles, prediction style gains etc. I’ve started tracking those flows separately in Awaken tax instead of just throwing it all under “capital gains,” because if the rules keep getting written by insiders I do not trust the IRS to be chill about how I label income later. That part is self defense not shill.

So yeah... he is not “pro crypto” the way CT means it. He is pro... his... crypto. Pro... his donors’... crypto. Pro... his friends’... crypto.

1oleohd,Bitcoin breaks October streak with first monthly loss since 2018,Moneycontrol,76,17,2025-11-01 04:06:31,"Bitcoin on Friday was on track for a monthly loss in October for the first time since 2018, snapping a seven-year streak of gains that had earned the month a lucky reputation among cryptocurrency traders.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is set for a nearly 5% decline this month, as the digital asset has struggled in recent weeks amid broader market jitters and muted investor risk appetite.

Cryptocurrencies ""came into October, tracking gold, tracking stocks near all-time highs, and then as uncertainty hit people for the first time maybe this year, they didn't rotate back into bitcoin en masse,"" said Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko.

October saw the largest crypto liquidation in history after U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.moneycontrol.com/topic/donald-trump/) announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software.

Bitcoin fell as low as $104,782.88 during the October 10-11 period, after setting a fresh record high just days earlier above $126,000.

""That washout on the 10th, it really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow,"" said McCarthy. ""It's bitcoin and (ether), and even those can still have 10% drawdowns in 15, 20 minutes.""

A whirlwind October is set to end with spooked investors unsure of the global monetary policy path in the near term, as the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed back against market bets that it would continue to cut rates this year as the government shutdown blocks crucial economic data.

Meanwhile, several influential figures have expressed concerns about high valuations in equity markets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the U.S. stock market within the next six months to two years.

Despite its October decline, bitcoin is still up more than 16% so far this year.

Cryptocurrencies have generally enjoyed a boost this year as Trump has embraced digital assets, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by Trump's financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bitcoin-breaks-october-streak-with-first-monthly-loss-since-2018-13646348.html,76,1,1,BTC,positive

1olnunr,Altcoin Rally and Market Cycle (Investor Psychology),Fit_Significance_549,96,27,2025-11-01 13:29:04,"In August 2025, I predicted a sudden collapse in Ethereum between October and November 2025. The collapse phase occurred, and the post-collapse process is unfolding exactly as described.

After this collapse, lower highs are being formed to make investors believe that the Bear Market might have begun.

After the collapse in October, the majority claimed that “a rapid rise is about to begin,” but the process has continued as expected.

They are creating lower highs to give the impression that the Bear Market has started. They are doing everything possible, but there’s one very important thing to remember:

For the Bear Market to begin, new victims — those who will suffer in the next Bear phase — must first be drawn into the market.

Without an Altcoin Rally, new investors who will become the next Bear’s victims won’t enter the market, and the Bear Market won’t start.

The Altcoin Rally is preparation for the Bear Market. To keep this Ponzi-like system going, they must create an Altcoin Rally.

The accuracy of these statements often becomes clear months or even years later.

In December 2023, when it was said that the rise we were experiencing was not a Bull Market but a mid-cycle rebound, and that altcoins would drop by 70%, many disagreed — yet months later, it proved correct.

In June 2022, it was predicted that Bitcoin and Bitcoin dominance would rise together, and that staying in Bitcoin would be more profitable than holding altcoins. That analysis also turned out to be accurate over time.

In May 2024, after earning fourfold returns from Bitcoin, the focus shifted back to altcoins.

Time has clearly shown who to trust and whose strategy is sound.

In the coming period, an Altcoin Rally will take place. They have no choice but to make it happen. Some may criticize or doubt this now, but the truth — and how those who ignore it will miss a major opportunity — will become evident in the months ahead.

Over the past week, BTC has shown resilience, holding firm above $108,000 despite profit-taking and macro uncertainty.

Technical analysis shows a mixed picture. The daily RSI remains near neutral at 49, signaling consolidation before a potential breakout. Moving averages suggest short-term hesitation but long-term bullish momentum.
If Bitcoin breaks and sustains above $114,000, a rally toward $118,000–$120,000 becomes likely within the next 5 days.

However, failure to hold the $108,000 support zone could trigger a short-term correction toward $105,000.
Traders should watch for volume confirmation and keep positions small as volatility is expected to rise.

1omt1s9,Trump just dragged Binance into a diplomatic nightmare with Nigeria,Gullible-Tale9114,244,53,2025-11-02 21:12:16,"Things are getting messy. Trump posted on Truth Social threatening to cut all aid to Nigeria and even hinted at military action over alleged persecution of Christians. But then CZ jumped in and made it about crypto too.

CZ posted saying Nigeria basically kidnapped Tigran Gambaryan an ex Binance employee who was detained for 8 months back in 2024. Gambaryan was arrested along with another colleague during an investigation into Binance's operations in Nigeria. The other guy escaped but Gambaryan stayed in prison facing money laundering charges.

The situation got so bad that 18 US attorneys general asked the White House to classify him as a hostage. Nigeria denied any wrongdoing saying he got proper medical care and legal process. Eventually charges were dropped in October on humanitarian grounds.

Now CZ's post went viral but then he deleted it after getting backlash from Nigerians who said he was misrepresenting their legal system. Nigerians are pushing back hard saying it was a lawful arrest not a kidnapping and that every country has the right to enforce their own laws.

Plot twist - Gambaryan himself is now claiming Nigerian officials extorted 50 million from the Biden administration to get him released. He's calling them a lawless regime.

This whole situation shows how crypto companies are getting caught up in geopolitical mess. Nigeria's still a huge market for crypto in Africa but Binance already suspended naira trading last year after regulatory issues.

I recently launched a perp-trading product called **Signals**, built directly inside **Whop**. It’s been a little over a week since launch, and while early feedback has been positive, I’m struggling to get traction on the marketing + partnership side.

**What Signals does:**

* Allows creators to publish trading signals **directly inside Whop**
* Their members can execute those trades with **one click**
* Supports proper perpetual trading in-app
* Creators earn a cut on every executed trade (much better than standard referral links)

So the goal is to help creators monetize signals more efficiently while giving their communities a very simple execution experience.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m looking to **partner with someone experienced in crypto marketing / growth**, ideally someone who has worked with trading apps, signal groups, or has a strong network among creators.

This could be:

* A marketer
* A growth partner
* Someone with connections to creators / traders
* A small agency or indie builder

I’m open to different partnership structures (rev-share, flat, hybrid) depending on what makes sense.

If this sounds interesting or you’d like to check out the product, feel free to DM or drop a comment.

1onmpn0,"France just called crypto holdings ""unproductive wealth"" - what this means for you as a trader",hodorrny,43,46,2025-11-03 20:17:39,"France’s lower house just approved (first reading, as part of the 2026 budget) a change that would treat some assets as “unproductive wealth”… and crypto is explicitly in the list.

Heres the deal. If your net taxable wealth exceeds €1.3 million, the proposal would apply a flat 1% annual levy on “unproductive wealth.” A main home could get up to a €1m allowance under the version MPs advanced. This is a wealth tax on asset value… so you can owe even if you havent sold anything yet. It still has to clear the rest of the budget process (including the Senate) before it’s law.

Before this, France only taxed crypto when you actually sold it for profit. This would add a separate annual wealth layer (like yachts, gold, art) on top of the existing capital-gains rules.

What does this mean for traders? French residents must declare foreign digital-asset accounts (Form 3916/3916-bis) and, if this passes, they’d also have to value covered assets each year for the wealth levy. Non-compliance already carries fines, so the “full transparency” point stands. Practical tip… keep a year-end valuation log across wallets and exchanges; I use awaken tax to tag disposals vs annual valuations and export a clean report if this measure lands.

Supporters say it nudges money toward “productive” investment and raises revenue. Critics worry it hits smaller millionaires, may push investors out, and complicates valuations for volatile assets like crypto.

If you’re holding significant crypto in France, talk to a tax professional now. Tot up your worldwide assets carefully, check the residence and account-declaration rules, and be ready in case the final budget keeps this measure.

The backdrop:

Major altcoins like Ethereum, BNB and Solana fell 6–11% last week, indicating broad-based weakness.

Prediction & Outlook (next 3-5 days):

 If BTC holds above $106K–$107K and volume recovers, a rebound toward $110K-$112K is plausible.

According to Teng it was MGX who decided to use USD1 for their investment into Binance, not the exchange itself. He's basically saying Binance didnt partake in that choice at all.

But heres where it gets complicated. Back in July Bloomberg reported that Binance actually helped develop some of the code behind USD1, citing three sources familiar with the situation. CZ even threatened to sue them over that claim.

Important timeline note. The MGX deal using USD1 was announced first in May 2025… and months later, on October 23, 2025, Trump pardoned CZ. So the sequence is deal first, pardon after...not the other way around. On the nuts-and-bolts side, anyone with exposure to these flows should keep a clean paper trail; I’m tagging USD1-related movements and fiat ramps by counterparty and country in Awaken tax so the audit math lines up if questions come.

Eric Trump who co founded World Liberty Financial confirmed the MGX funding would be settled using USD1 which means the Trump family profits from the transaction. And Trump himself said in a 60 Minutes interview that he didnt even know who CZ was which nobody really believes.

Senators like Elizabeth Warren and Chris Murphy have been calling out these connections. Warren’s team says CZ’s lawyer threatened a defamation suit over her comments tying Binance and money laundering; Murphy has also publicly called the arrangement corrupt.

The whole situation just feels like theres way more going on beneath the surface than anyones admitting.

I'd love to hear people thoughts on getting life insurance on bitcoin or any other unique bitcoin businesses people have found?

1. T10Y2Y up from Deep Inversion (aka Yield Curve Re-Steepening)
   * The difference between 10-year and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields. When negative (inverted), it signals recession fear and tight money. When it rises from its low (re-steepens), it means markets expect rate cuts and easier conditions.
   * Now: From –106 bps in June 2023 to + 50bps today uninverted and stable.
   * Bullish: Lower short-term rates = cheaper borrowing -> more capital for risk assets like Bitcoin.
2. WALCL Stops Shrinking, Flat for now (Fed Balance Sheet Pivot)
   * The Fed’s total assets (WALCL on FRED). During QT, it falls, draining money from markets. When it flattens or grows, liquidity returns.
   * Now: QT ends December 1, 2025, $95B/month reinvested into T-bills.
   * Bullish: More bank reserves = more lending = more money chasing Bitcoin and stocks.
3. DXY down (U.S. Dollar Weakening)
   * The U.S. Dollar Index. A falling DXY means global investors are moving out of cash into risk assets.
   * Now: From 109 in Feb 2025 to \~ 100 today, 9% drop in 9 months.
   * Weak dollar = strong Bitcoin, gold, stocks, and crypto.

What caught my eye is the new subscription option. instead of locking up CRO, you can just pay monthly for Plus or Pro. I went with the Pro plan to see what it’s like since I didn’t feel like staking a bunch of tokens upfront.

So far, the perks have been good. no trading fees, cashback on the visa card, and even airport lounge access (didn’t expect that one). feels like a nice upgrade without committing to a big lockup.

Governance across major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche keeps showing the same pattern: decisions end up in the hands of a few whales and core developers, while the rest of the community just watches from the sidelines.

Whales vote with massive holdings, dev teams push updates that often favor technical goals over community needs, and most users are left out of the loop. It’s decentralization in name, but not always in action. Many updates feel like temporary patches, and unless you know how to code or navigate governance proposals, your input rarely counts.

In today’s market, as new chains and L2s emerge promising community driven evolution, it’s worth asking, are we truly decentralizing, or just repackaging control?

That’s why Tau Net caught my attention. Instead of relying on votes or dev teams, it’s building a blockchain where participants express their intentions in plain English. The system’s logic engine then finds consensus and updates itself block by block, no coding, no endless governance battles.

This model flips the script: no centralized teams holding the keys, no token-weighted dominance. Tokens like $AGRS are designed for real utility, trading knowledge, compute power, and participation, not just speculation.

If it works as intended, Tau Net could redefine what decentralization means in 2025, a network that literally adapts to the collective voice of its users, not the balance sheets of its biggest holders.

Just checked out their Telegram community recently,  very active and insightful. It feels like a project genuinely experimenting with next gen governance.

The raise marks a major milestone in Ripple’s evolution from cross-border remittance provider to full-scale blockchain infrastructure leader, positioning its RLUSD stablecoin as a cornerstone of enterprise settlement.

Shortly after the funding announcement, Ripple unveiled a partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to settle credit-card transactions directly on the XRP Ledger using RLUSD. The integration allows instant, low-cost fiat settlement between issuers and merchants a first-of-its-kind move that merges traditional finance with on-chain liquidity. Executives said the collaboration aims to bring stablecoin-based settlement to global card networks by mid-2026, reinforcing Ripple’s transition into institutional payment systems.

The dual announcements triggered a surge in XRP trading volume and social media momentum. Analysts described the news as a “turning point for blockchain payments,” citing Ripple’s growing network of regulated financial partners and its renewed pursuit of mainstream adoption after years of regulatory headwinds.

1opa4h4,Bitcoin dropped below the 365 day moving average...,hodorrny,111,59,2025-11-05 18:01:14,"So Bitcoin dipped below 99k on Tuesday and broke through the 365 day moving average which has everyone debating whether we're entering a bear market or if this is just another correction.

The 365 day MA is basically the average price over the past year and it’s a widely watched long term trend guide… not a formal “bear market” switch by itself. In 2022, dropping below it lined up with the broader bear phase, which is why people are nervous now.

Bitcoin is more than 20% off its all time high above 126k, which fits the common “bear territory” rule of thumb. But here’s where opinions split.

Some analysts say this looks like another correction inside the 2025 uptrend rather than the start of a prolonged downtrend. They point out that in past bull cycles, 20% pullbacks happened and were sometimes followed by rebounds.

Others are more cautious and argue the real line in the sand is around 100k… a decisive break and hold below that would be a stronger warning sign. Right now price is hovering close to that level so everyone’s focused there.

On chain data is mixed. There’s been noticeable reactivation and distribution from long term holders, which adds sell pressure. At the same time, a chunk of supply remains off exchanges, which can limit immediate forced selling. small practical note… if you are adding or trimming through this chop, tag buys vs transfers and lot ids as you go… i keep it tidy in Awaken tax so tax time doesn’t turn into detective work later.

The debate basically comes down to whether this is routine market cleansing or the beginning of something worse.

**Strategy Update Fix**  
Found an issue in how strategy results were written to the TimescaleDB.  
It was updating against *all* market data instead of staying aligned with the current trend.  
\-> Adjusted the prompt logic to feed only the correct timeframe data,  
making the reasoning layer far more efficient and relevant.

**Balancing the Patience**  
The model was way too passive past 2 days! Throwing too many “WAIT” signals (which, fair, matched the red market 😅).  
\-> So I made it a little more aggressive to react with a lower RR (1.2-1.5 range) to potential reversals.

**Self-Validation Loop**  
To counter that passivity, I added a `NEXT_SETUP_TO_WATCH` field in its response.  
\-> The next run includes this field again to give itself insights & if it still agrees with its previous outlook.

**Result**  
Now it’s returning both **BUY** and **SELL** positions! Seems the market momentum is shifting up again, so I’ll be watching how it behaves on short confirmations next.

* Implementing notification channels (so it can run on my NVIDIA Jetson 24/7)
* Adding wallet bookkeeping to feed open positions back into the prompt for smarter decisions.

1opn4bm,is this actually when you should buy more?,Gullible-Tale9114,108,77,2025-11-06 02:35:13,"Bitcoin dropped below 100k earlier this week and everyones either panicking or waiting on the sidelines. But Matt Hougan from Bitwise has a pretty interesting take that might change how you see this sideways action.

He's comparing whats happening now to when Facebook went public back in 2012. Facebook IPO’d at $38, then spent about a year below that level before eventually climbing to $600+ in later years. During that time the fundamentals werent getting worse it was just distribution happening. Early employees were cashing out their life changing wealth while institutions slowly absorbed all that supply.

Hougan says Bitcoin is in the exact same phase right now. People who bought at 1 dollar or 10 dollars or 100 dollars are finally selling into deep institutional demand. Five years ago someone selling a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin might have hit price harder. Today large sales seem to get absorbed more easily because of the ETFs, funds, and some corporates buying.

This sideways chop isnt weakness according to him its actually what maturity looks like. Once these early holders finish distributing the only thing stopping Bitcoin from going from roughly the low trillions toward an order of magnitude higher market cap is broader global acceptance.

His big point is that 1% allocations to Bitcoin are over. He thinks 5% should be the new minimum for investors because Bitcoin’s volatility is lower than in early cycles but still real and it’s becoming a more established institutional asset now. small practical note… if you are accumulating through this chop, keep clean records so future disposals are easy… i tag buys vs transfers and lot IDs in Awaken tax so tax time doesnt turn into a mess later.

So is this the moment to buy more? If you believe in the IPO comparison then yes this distribution phase is exactly when you want to be accumulating before institutions finish absorbing the supply.

Satoshi would be rolling in his crypto grave right now if he saw the manipulation and non-privacy issues STILL not rolled into these crypto transactions.

ZCash is taking off, because we need die-hard crypto investors back... ones who want true privacy - ones who want no manipulation - ones who want to buy, stake, and hold their coins to try and soak up all available ZEC coins left & drive the price thru the roof.

ZCash has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, and as of November 2025 the circulating supply is approximately 16.37 million coins.

Approximately 30% of coins are in shielded pools, which means they are encrypted to hide sender, receiver, and amount information. This is a significant milestone reflecting growing demand for privacy-focused transactions, as it makes it harder to trace the flow of the coins.

When ZEC is sent between shielded addresses, a cryptographic proof confirms the transaction is valid without revealing the details.

This is part of the larger trend happening now where users are increasingly moving coins from public ledgers into encrypted channels.

He stated: Having been $36,000 too high compared with gold at the end of last year, Bitcoin is now around $68,000 too low...

This means that bitcoin’s current fair price would be around $170K, which would open the doors for a massive upswing in the coming months.

In the mean time exchanges like Bitget and others diversifying into stock futures contracts surpassing $1 billion in cumulative trading volume during this period while offering there users Halloween events...

Blackrock also adopted this as they recently announced plans to tokenize US stocks and give users other other pairs to trade and invest especially during periods like these when crypto is dumping...

overall, while price action is always uncertain as bitcoin usually trades like a risk asset, adoption is scaling and regulation is currently underway, making bitcoin an attractive asset for institutions that still haven’t entered the crypto market.

Are you thinking of investing or just curious about all the hype?

ZCash is legit, not just hype - it's all about privacy, offering shielded transactions that protect your financial transactions. Would you want a GPS tracker on your cash - then why would you want one on your crypto usage?

Unlike transparent blockchains, it uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to verify transactions without revealing sensitive info - and the focus is on privacy and security which drives its adoption, not just speculation.

Meanwhile the crypto market structure bill everyone was hyped about is basically frozen. the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act passed the House on July 17, 2025… got sent to the Senate in September… and action has stalled during the shutdown.

Members of Congress are still being paid during the shutdown… while many federal workers are furloughed or working without pay until funding is restored. so almost all non-urgent legislative work has taken a back seat… crypto bill included.

Talks are still happening around digital asset rules… but Democrats have been firm about tying any reopening deal to extending health care premium tax credits… which has kept things at a stalemate.

Senator Cynthia Lummis… one of the louder crypto advocates… said in August she hoped to move a market structure package through Senate committees in the fall and get a final bill to the President by year end… paving the way for implementation in 2026. that timeline looks shaky now.

With the government shut down for 38 days and holidays coming up… even a quick reopening leaves a heavy backlog… so crypto legislation probably won’t be priority one right away.

1orux07,"[DISCUSSION] Thoughts heading into Q4: liquidity still shaky, BTC dominance creeping up, and what I’m changing this cycle",Hagya_ant,9,12,2025-11-08 17:18:07,"I’ve been trying to make sense of the last few weeks, and the market still feels like it’s stuck in this weird “half risk-on, half waiting room” mode. Liquidity pops up here and there, but nothing strong enough to kick off a full alt rotation. BTC dominance keeps drifting up too, which usually means alts won’t get real movement unless there’s an actual catalyst behind them.

The only narrative that seems to have some real follow-through is the RWA stuff, but even there, most of the noise is just announcements. Only a handful of teams are shipping anything that resembles real usage.

Portfolio wise I’m keeping it simple: mostly BTC and ETH as the base, a small RWA basket I’m willing to cut quickly if nothing gets delivered, and then a tiny “whatever happens happens” bucket for illiquid plays. Nothing complicated.

One small change I’m making this cycle: last time around I kept too much idle cash on exchanges and ended up taking a lot of impulsive entries. Now I just keep some of that inactive stack on Nехо so it’s separate from the capital I actually trade with.

Also, I learned the hard way that chasing thin liquidity is basically donating money. I jumped into a breakout last cycle without checking depth and got wiped for ~60% in two days. Now I don’t touch anything unless I see actual volume and a clear reason for why the move should continue.

Curious what you all are seeing:
– Are there any RWA teams actually doing something meaningful right now?
– Do you think we’re close to alts waking up, or still too early with BTC.D climbing?
– How are you separating long-term vs. short-term funds so you don’t overtrade?

After a cut in October, expectations are that the central bank will proceed cautiously. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already indicated that further rate cuts are not guaranteed.

With official data lacking, analysts are now turning to figures from companies like ADP and Indeed to gauge the labor market. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Fed is trying to estimate inflation using its own model. According to that model, inflation likely stayed around 3 percent in October, similar to September. However, this remains an estimate and cannot replace official data.

Even if the government shutdown ends quickly, economists warn that the backlogs are significant. Inflation reports for October and November may arrive too late to influence the December rate decision. This means the Fed may have to make its decision without fresh data on the table.

Markets Hanging on Every Word

Investors are closely watching every word from Fed officials. Speeches from influential members, like John Williams of the New York Fed and Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, are being scrutinized.

Financial markets are still cautiously pricing in a potential rate cut in December, but that probability is fading. Without new data, the Fed may decide to play it safe and leave rates unchanged for now.

Central banks outside the U.S. are also monitoring developments closely. This week, new data and policy statements are expected from Canada, China, the U.K., Japan, and Sweden. But in the U.S., it remains quiet.

The shutdown is not only halting data releases but also making data collection impossible. Even if Washington reopens, economists expect delays and incomplete reports.

As long as the government remains shut, the Fed must navigate without a compass.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1osnedy/fed_faces_a_gamble_ahead_of_next_interest_rate/,4,0,0,,positive
1oss0rs,$2000 tariff dividend?,Background-Day-4957,0,20,2025-11-09 19:18:16,"This is:
1. Market manipulation again? His kids probably added more long positions in n crypto.
2. Trump realizing the K curve economy, and basically this is a stimulus check for the struggling lower right curve, which is the majority of Americans, especially with midterms in 12 months.
3. Trying to put pressure on Supreme Court to not overturn his IEEPA tariff powers. Basically telling the people it's the SC fault for not getting your stimulus checks, if overturned. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1oss0rs/2000_tariff_dividend/,0,0,0,,positive
1ossroh,Trump just announced 2000 dollar tariff dividend checks... heres what it means for crypto,Gullible-Tale9114,125,136,2025-11-09 19:46:59,"Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9 saying most Americans will get a 2000 dollar ""dividend"" funded by tariff revenue. The payout would be ""at least 2000 per person"" and would exclude high income people, but for everyone else its basically a new stimulus check coming from tariffs instead of normal taxes.

Theres a huge catch tho. The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case on whether Trumps emergency tariff program is even legal, and prediction markets are betting against him. Recent data has Kalshi putting the odds of the Court approving the tariffs around the low 20s and Polymarket in a similar range, so this is far from guaranteed.

If it does happen, analysts at The Kobeissi Letter estimate roughly 85 percent of US adults would qualify based on how the COVID stimulus was distributed. Thats a big lump of cash hitting household balance sheets at once.

For crypto this is pretty clearly short term bullish. During COVID, surveys found about 11 percent of young Americans (18 to 34) invested part of their stimulus checks into crypto. And Anthony Pompliano is already pointing out that stocks and Bitcoin basically only know how to go higher when new stimulus money shows up.

The longer term story is where it gets messy. Analysts including The Kobeissi Letter are warning that this kind of extra stimulus on top of existing deficits just adds more fuel to inflation and slowly kills your purchasing power. Your 2000 dollars today is likely worth less in real terms a few years from now. Bitcoin advocate Simon Dixon has already said that if you do not put that money into assets, it will just be inflated away or disappear into interest payments and bank deposits.

So yeah, if this plan survives the Supreme Court and actually gets through Congress, it probably gives risk assets and crypto a nice pump in the short term. But the tradeoff is the same as always... more stimulus, more pressure on the dollar over time.

1ostyiz,U.S. Policy Shift: Trump Says He Will Sign Pro-Crypto Legislation,guyletibro,0,21,2025-11-09 20:33:47,"**Trump recently stated that he will sign crypto legislation.**

This is not just an election ploy.

It is the establishment of a political direction.

After several years marked by regulatory pressure (SEC vs. crypto companies, tax uncertainty, compliance issues), the United States seems to be moving toward a clearer framework that is potentially favorable to players in the sector.



What matters here is not the announcement itself, but the change in momentum:

The discourse is shifting back toward innovation rather than punishment.

Major US institutions are watching and positioning themselves.

Offshore-based crypto companies may reconsider returning to the US if the framework becomes stable.



Historically, major political movements in emerging sectors are only reflected in prices after a certain delay. The best positions are often taken before the news becomes consensus.

All I see nowadays on CT is ZEC this ZEC that, privacy this privacy that.

Where were those same influencers/kols that now apparently love privacy so much, when they should have pushed XMR to the new highs and try to onboard more users to it?

I assume this is just because they hold a lot of ZEC and want to see even more profits rake in from it?

What is your opinion on ZEC & XMR? 
Which do you like more and why?

I see some good things about ZEC, but I prefer and always will use XMR over it.

1ot9te1,"Bitcoin is holding its 50-week MA, but how long can support last?",Axirohq,8,8,2025-11-10 09:55:50,"Bitcoin is sitting just above its 50-week moving average, a level that’s been tested and held three times in the past five years, including during the August 2024 yen carry trade unwind. BTC hasn’t closed below it since March 2023.

While this level has been a reliable support zone, downside risks are building. Broader risk assets are under pressure from valuation concerns and the prolonged US government shutdown. Crypto has traded cautiously since the October 10 sell-off.

That said, several upside catalysts remain:  
• A potential end to the government shutdown this week, the longest on record at 40 days  could boost sentiment.  
• Reports suggest bipartisan talks are progressing, raising hopes for a deal.  
• Trump’s idea of using tariff revenue for $2,000 dividend checks could act as direct fiscal stimulus, potentially spilling into crypto markets.  
• BTC perp positioning is currently neutral to low (Z-score -0.65, trailing 1-year), suggesting room for upside if momentum returns.

Support is holding but pressure is building.

7lvqui,1 week challenge: 0.1 Bitcoin to 1 Bitcoin,Cmorebuts,721,434,2017-12-24 15:46:00,"Over the next 7 days I'm going to use just under 0.1 Bitcoin (0.0938) I have set aside from my portfolio to solely buy what El McAfee tells me to buy. It will be called the ""7 days of Christmas challenge"". Will post results in 7 days with a daily breakdown. 

I know hes a paid shill and I know they are all trash coins, I don't plan on holding any for more than a few minutes. I have absolutely nothing to do where I currently live so my plan is to leave his Twitter open while I play through Halo CE and borderlands 2. The moment he tweets some dribble and if it's on the exchange with my Bitcoin I'll buy immediately and sell after I'm happy with the profits. I'll compare to my main portfolio and see where it ends up.

Edit: after some math I realised I only need to make 39% profit on each trade to achieve this. Fun fact, using similar math and a well known calculation you only need 10 trades/cycles of 7.2% gains to double your money!

Edit 2: Added a name for this after lying in bed unable to sleep - The 7 days of Christmas challenge as it starts on Christmas day for me in Australia.

Edit 3: RIP inbox, away from home for Christmas so waking up on Christmas morning to so many comments albeit remind me in 1 week was pretty cool.

4: Day 1 was a failure, not on cryptopia like all the past ones. tried it with some money I had on bittrex but it truly seems bots have taken over and instantly cause connection issues when you go to that exchange pair....

Also thank you for the Reddit gold kind stranger, was a nice Christmas present :), this individual a long with 4 others have asked me to add a dogecoin address for future projects so I have. 

To be clear I am not asking for donations or money at all, anything donated will be stored and eventually donated to charity. If I actually get some donations to this address I'm thinking id run a poll for the community to vote to determine where the coins should be invested. After a year of hodling and perhaps several more polls to adjust the portfolio any money will be donated to charity. Again I have been asked to do this and replied to these people saying I don't want to look like I'm asking for money, I do however think this would be a cool idea to have a community run portfolio to give to needy causes.

9hps35,Why isn't Crowdholding bigger?,georgeforeham,0,0,2018-09-21 13:19:00,"Hello crypto lovers,

I want to talk and start discussions about Crowdholding. I think it's a great platform where you can earn crypto for giving feedback to tasks (Crowdsourcing) that are created by ICO / crypto startups. When you comment you get their token as well as Crowdholding's YUP. There is also bounties / airdrops on there.

It's a pretty platform, works well and there is a lot going on there. I think it's a great project because -

\- Their token is listed on CoinMarketCap

\- They completed their ICO back in January this year and have been growing, they had a working platform way before their ICO

\- Every month they are innovating, today they brought out a Twitter sharing feature, which means no more spreadsheets / bounty campaign managers ([https://www.crowdholding.com/project/68/task/665/introducing-our-new-twitter-sharing-system](https://www.crowdholding.com/project/68/task/665/introducing-our-new-twitter-sharing-system))

\- They have over 50 projects and 28k signups and are growing month on month. They have had tasks from DeepOnion, ITF and SmartCash (all listed on CoinMarketCap)

I believe they are one establish token away from being a big force in the crypto platform world. I would like your feedback on the project, as I think it offers people a way to get into crypto, is a better system than Bounty0x and if they keep growing their user base, then every ICO in the future will want to build their community through Crowdholding, as an ICO joining could have access to a large pool of potential investors / people to spread their marketing.

Here is the website if you want to check it out - r/[https://www.crowdholding.com](https://www.crowdholding.com/). I have been using it for a while and I love it, would love your feedback about what makes it a poor or great project.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/9hps35/why_isnt_crowdholding_bigger/,0,0,0,,positive

dg1clg,Summary of the new crypto tax guidelines (tldr included),Sal-BitcoinTax,1,1,2019-10-10 17:26:28,"Hey all - I know there's a dozen posts about the new crypto tax deadlines - so apologies for making it a dozen plus one.

Full disclosure, I work for Bitcoin.Tax, where this article was published. I've included the link to our summary, as well as our actual summary. Also - I'll be talking with a crypto tax pro on our podcast about these guidelines soon. I usually post links to our podcast on this subreddit, so stay tuned (if you want...) for that in the next few days. Hopefully this helps some folks, as parts of the new guidelines are fairly ambiguous.

**Link:**  [https://bitcoin.tax/blog/irs-crypto-tax-faq/](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/irs-crypto-tax-faq/)

**TLDR:**

* Crypto is still subject to capital gains.
* Airdrops and forks are income on controllable receipt at Fair Market  Value (FMV). If you didn't have control, you don't have income.
* FMV should be taken from the traded exchange, source or value of  received services and not external sources, such as price aggregators.  FMV for an off-chain transaction is the value it would have had if it  was traded on the exchange.
* Peer-to-peer or other transactions use FMV from a source that  analyzes worldwide indices to calculate a value at that date and time.  Or, you can use an accurate representation of the FMV.
* Specific Identification is allowed (not just FIFO) when it can be documented. **\[new\]**
* Gifts are not income and giftee can use the documented gifted basis for gains (but not losses).
* Transfers are not tax events.

Generally, this is the same as the advice and common practice used by  taxpayers and accountants. Although, the exception here is the  clarification of the *specific identification* rule. We'll talk about that below.

**Summary:**

The IRS has issued their long-awaited guidance on the tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. You can read their [FAQ On Virtual Currency Transactions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) on the IRS website.

This is the first official guidance since the original [2014-21 notice](https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-16_IRB#NOT-2014-21) in April 2014.

## IRS Cryptocurrency Tax FAQ

We have gone into more detail for some of the main points in their FAQ.

## Hard forks and airdrops

Despite peculiar wording by the IRS, they have confirmed that receipt  of crypto from an airdrop or fork is to be treated as income, and so  subject to income tax.

>ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new  cryptocurrency when it is received, which is when the transaction is  recorded on the distributed ledger, provided you have dominion and  control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell,  exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency

However, these drops typically have no market (perhaps a futures  market) until they have existed for a period of time, so establishing a  value could be difficult. It is possible that the value could be zero  right at that exact moment it is *recorded on the distributed ledger*.

In order to receive income, you must have dominion and control over  these new crypto. This effectively means you must be able to manage it;  typically you would have the private keys or it is immediately available  in a custodial wallet or online account, e.g. Coinbase.

If the crypto doesn't appear in your wallet, or you don't get control  of it until a later date, then that later date is used to calculated  the USD income value.

This had been a common question among crypto traders: if BTC was  forked off into a new ""BTC"" coin, which you might not even have been  aware of, do you still have income? The answer is no. Unless, you  subsequently get access to those new coins, in which case you do have  income on the date you receive control.

When you have income for an airdrop or fork, this also sets the cost  basis (value and date) for any subsequent capital gains calculations.

## Fair Market Value (FMV)

FMV is used to give something a value, i.e. what it's worth. If you  list a bike for sale, you might research the prices for which other  people are selling. Those prices give a FMV. But it you sell your bike  and someone buys it for $100, then the bike's FMV was $100.

With crypto, sometimes we need to know FMV because we are not trading directly for dollars.

For example, if you sell 1 BTC for 150 LTC, you are disposing of the 1  BTC at FMV. You need to know the USD value in order to know the  proceeds and to calculate any capital gains or losses.

So, first, if this was traded on an exchange, we use the spot price  on the exchange at that time. This is true even if the transaction was  off-chain.

However, where no FMV exists, such as a peer-to-peer transaction, then you have to get the value from elsewhere.

So, secondly, use the FMV of the service or product you are  exchanging. With the above bike example, say buying it with crypto, the  FMV would be that of the bike itself (the price it would have sold for  USD).

Lastly, when no value can be obtained, then use a service that  provides a consistent worldwide indices value (the IRS are calling this  an ""explorer"" but that is a confusing term as blockchain explorers may  not provide a USD value). If you do not use an ""explorer"" value, you can  use an ""accurate representation of the cryptocurrency's market value"".  Much like with fiat, this means using an establish and consistent  source.

## FIFO and Specific Identification

Advice from most tax preparers and accountants has been to err on the  side of caution and go with First-In First-Out (FIFO). Basically, if  you bought 1 BTC for $9,000 and later another for $10,000, when you come  to sell 1 BTC (or partial) you would use the cost of the first 1 BTC  that you had acquired.

This is the default IRS cost basis method and would not be challenged.

Some taxpayers had filed using specific identification, where FIFO  was not used and instead the ""lot"" that was sold was chosen from their  wallets. Summary strategies could also be employed, such as Last-In  Last-Out (LIFO), where the basis of the most recently acquired crypto is  used instead.

These other strategies, such as last-in first-out, closest-cost or  lowest-cost, often try to minimize the gains per transaction and defer  them until later.

This is the biggest change in the new IRS guidance and confirms that  specific identification can be used. However, you must be able to  document this, which the IRS describes as:

>You may identify a specific unit of virtual currency either by  documenting the specific unit’s unique digital identifier such as a  private key, public key, and address, or by records showing the  transaction information for all units of a specific virtual currency,  such as Bitcoin, held in a single account, wallet, or address.This information must show (1) the date and time each unit was  acquired, (2) your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the  time it was acquired, (3) the date and time each unit was sold,  exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, and (4) the fair market value of  each unit when sold, exchanged, or disposed of, and the amount of money  or the value of property received for each unit.

There is no guidance if any extra information should be reported, but  it is generally the same information that is added to the 8949 form  where capital gains are reported.

## Gifts and Donations

Similar to gifts of stocks or property, the rules regarding cost  basis have remained unchanged. Received gifts are not immediate income  but you do still recognize an capital gains income when you later come  to sell, exchange or dispose of the cryptocurrency.

You can use the original basis (with documentation) from the giver in  order to make use of long-term gains. However, your received basis  becomes the lesser of the giver's cost basis and the FMV of the gift on  the date you received it. This is to prevent from gifting losses. Also,  if you do not have documentation showing the gift cost basis, then your  basis is zero, i.e. you must declare 100% as capital gains.

Donations to registered charities do not recognize income, gains or  losses. The value of your charitable donation is the FMV on the date of  the gift if you have held the crypto for more than a year. For a year or  less, it is lesser of the crypto's cost basis or its FMV on the day of  the gift.

## What was not mentioned

There are still some key questions and ambiguities that tax  professionals have been looking for clarification. For instance, with  hard forks and airdrops, if you have the private keys but no software,  does that count as control?

Airdrop and forks generally have no markets when they are created, so  is there a zero FMV? And should you take the value only when you  exercise control?

Can specific identification be used at will or must it be done consistently?

Were 1031 ""like-kind"" exchanges ever a valid approach before 2018?

## Guidance is retroactive

Finally, be aware that IRS guidance is always retroactive, unless  otherwise stated, and so should be applied to past and future crypto  transactions. If you have not followed these rules then you should  consult with your tax professional and may need to file an amendment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/dg1clg/summary_of_the_new_crypto_tax_guidelines_tldr/,1,1,1,"BTC, LTC",positive

As a fruit of rapid technical and business development, Binance's BNB token cemented its position in the top 10. In fact, BNB (#9) has a market cap almost twice that of its rank contender, Cardano (#10).

BNB holders had a year worth celebrating, building wealth through more than just token appreciation as Binance gave out millions to holders through various events, including massive airdrops.

Given that Binance burned $114.9M, it has an indirect P/E of 23.8, almost in line with the P/E of ICE, the owner of world's biggest exchange, NYSE.

g200p5,Ergo use case: ‘hot potato’ monetary policy,eleanorcwhite,0,0,2020-04-15 20:26:42,"*As the next financial crisis takes hold, it’s clear that conventional monetary policy is at its limit. Smart contract platforms like Ergo enable more innovative, targeted implementations of economic stimulation that the conventional banking sector cannot achieve.*

Conventional monetary policy is a hammer. It works as far as it goes, but if all you have is a hammer then every problem starts to look like a nail.

When the Global Financial Crisis hit over a decade ago, central banks did what they were used to doing. Cutting interest rates means it’s cheaper to borrow money, so there’s more cash in the system that can be spent and will circulate in the economy – paying for goods and services, funding employment and allowing life to continue something like as normal.

That, at any rate, is the theory. It’s what central banks do in recessions to stimulate economic activity. When times are better, they raise interest rates to make it more expensive to borrow money and prevent the economy from overheating (including asset bubbles).

## The outer limits

This is a blunt tool, but it works, up to a point. In the 2008 crisis, the problem was more severe – so severe, in fact, that interest rates were slashed to zero. Banks were still afraid to lend because they didn’t know the quality of the collateral they were offered in return, those notorious mortgage-backed securities.

So the central banks undertook a programme of Quantitative Easing (QE). This entailed creating huge amounts of cash that didn’t exist before, then purchasing various assets from the banks. The idea was that the central bank would take on the risk and the assets, and commercial banks would then use this gift of liquidity to lend to small businesses and individuals, allowing them to continue operating as before.

It didn’t work. Little of that newly-created money went to small businesses. Instead, banks used it to shore up their own balance sheets and make their own finances safer, investing only in low-risk assets rather than risky SMEs. Ultimately that cash filtered through to assets like the stock market and property, making the wealthy even more wealthy while the poorer were priced out of the market.

## Helicopter money

Today, as we experience the greatest financial challenge of our lifetimes – greater than even the Global Financial Crisis – central banks are considering even more unorthodox approaches. One of these is ‘helicopter money’. This involves cash being simply airdropped directly to citizens, either in the form of tax breaks or as money straight into their bank accounts. America has discussed giving $1,200 to every adult. Other nations are exploring the same idea.

But there’s a problem with this, too.

Just like the banks, ordinary citizens are worried about their finances. So instead of going out and spending (where ‘going out’ is even possible), they pay down their debt. That newly-printed money goes nowhere.

That’s really as far as central banks can go. But a platform like Ergo can offer different types of money, with different conditions attached via smart contracts, incentivising different behaviour in different circumstances. And that enables a whole different range of monetary policy tools.

## ‘Hot potato’ money

In normal times, banks seek to maintain an inflation rate of around 2%. This means money is worth less over time. So instead of saving it all, and seeing the value of their savings fall, citizens have the incentive to spend it and circulate it within the economy.

Too much inflation, of course, is a bad thing. Get money printing wrong and you have hyperinflation like Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and your economy collapses.

But what if we kept inflation low, but created a limited amount of a special class of money that had to be used quickly if it was to retain its value at all? We’ll call this ‘hot potato’ money, because it has to be passed on fast.

Using a blockchain and smart contracts, this would be a simple matter of creating a new token that could be freely transferred and traded, just like any other token. And it could be backed by reserves (held with the central bank, commercial banks or any other entity). But the difference would be that it has to be spent within a month of receiving it, or those tokens are locked, their value is lost to the holder and the funds that back them are freed up to return to the reserve holder.

So this would be regular money that people had to spend: use it or lose it. If they hoard it, it becomes useless. And we can ensure that it is not used to pay down debt by including conditions that ensure it cannot be used by the banking sector. Of course, Ergo’s Sigma protocols can be used to figure out what has been spent, where, without knowing individual spending habits – enabling even more targeted stimulus.

This idea likely has far-reaching implications – and possibly unintended consequences. What would the result be, for example, of creating different ‘classes’ of money that were only semi-interchangeable? Would this introduce unwelcome, even dangerous friction?

This and other questions would need to be explored further. What’s clear is that central banks are already experimenting with unconventional monetary policy and are fast reaching the end of the road. We can continue that experiment with better, more powerful and targeted tools.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/g200p5/ergo_use_case_hot_potato_monetary_policy/,0,0,0,,positive

Possible?,CoreyGilligan,6,0,2020-08-13 13:59:48,"According to people reviewing it, NEM's Symbol has an economic system that allows you to passively earn coin rewards just as if you were mining. Which they're saying is better than staking rewards given by exchanges since you don’t need to put your coins on an exchange and you are earning actual block rewards.  


You’ll earn on-chain block rewards even when your computer is turned off, and the rewards are sent to you instantly, the moment they are earned.

jwzx2c,Earn Up To 32% APY With Providing Liquidity on Uniswap for CORX token,waterbottles4,12,7,2020-11-19 09:46:10," 

CorionX team announce the CORX Liquidity Providers Reward Program that will reward CORX LP’s who provide liquidity to CORX Uniswap Pool CORX/ETH in the following options

♦️ As Liquidity Provider you will earn from the Uniswap 0,30% trading fee in the proportion of your pool stake.

♦️ All Liquidity Providers will get a $10–50 extra gift for their first time LP

♦️ Wide range of lock-up option to increase LP reward

The minimum amount to lock up in the LP — half ETH and half CORX — is $500.

It should be locked up for a given period to earn the offered % reward. The reward is paid half in ETH half in CORX at the end of the lock-up period.

We believe this LP incentive on Uniswap serves the best interest of our community and supports extending CORX use cases.

I tried again and now I have 400 UNI. Would you sell it all? I'm not sure if I should keep maybe a quarter. I had 20 UNI just for gambles already.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

LEGO, launching with a %100 safe and secure model. There is a dedicated private fund to promoting the coin and all events are already planned. Zero team tokens so there will be no manipulation or imminent dump. If you are looking for a safe ticket to the brick moon, this is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So if you get in now, you can get out safely at the brick moon. You can of course taking the risk of entering a fun project, but boys, what if the community reaches only a couple thousand people, do your X calculations, I couldn't.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This project is 100% transparent, everyone is welcome to ask anything about the project itself. You should come say hi to our community if it isn't convincing enough.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Rugs and scams become a common thing in BSC but this project is solid secure as liquidity locked for 6 months, presale using unicrypt and zero team tokens. If your last shots were rugged, your luck just turned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Presale is about to take place with huge demand so settle in early and buckle up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also don't forget to apply for the airdrop until 10th of April. God i would like to have some of those shiny tiny free $LEGO bricks.

nkqje8,"When did we stop educating ourselves from guys like Antonopoulos, Vitalik and Hoskinson, who have an in depth understanding of how blockachain works and a clear vision about the future?",klyde_donovan,1096,145,2021-05-25 14:05:11,"And why did we instead started listening to the uneducated opinions of billionaire superstars, who have already shown through their work ethics on their companies that they could not care less about decentralisation, have no vision for the space apart from profit and memes, and are now working behind closed doors on something that could potentially result in a major fork, where the core issue not only isn't technical, but could be absolutely catastrophic for transactional freedom and decentralisation of miners.

Please people, please stop feeding them with attention, clicks and your time. Let their own incompetence be their downfall and let people like the aforementioned blockachain pionners and many more that we know exist, provide the appropriate counter arguments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/nkqje8/when_did_we_stop_educating_ourselves_from_guys/,1096,0,0,,positive

Various rates based on the amount of xpr proton you hold, and much more when you're staking xpr in the proton wallet.

https://blog.protonchain.com/introducing-proton-lend-loan-a-new-decentralized-finance-lending-market-built-on-proton-blockchain/

And other indepth info about this project found here: https://blog.protonchain.com/

Ceo of Proton / Metal projects - Marshall Hayner did a detailed AMA last week providing clear insights for all developments and whats to come for Proton xpr. Here: /r/ProtonChain/comments/nh77uy/rprotonchain_ama_is_now_live_ask_marshall_anything/

Their new NFT market - mint nfts for almost zero cost! https://blog.protonchain.com/proton-market-goes-open-source-unlocking-nfts-for-billions-around-the-world/

Trading in the $0.0054-$0.008 range currently after a pullback from $0.034 recently with the market crash.

Every portfolio should consider having at least a few % exposure as its rare projects of this calibre come along in the middle of a bull market still in their startup trading range.
However nothing is for sure, and this is not financial advice either.
Definitely worth digging into and learning about though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/nlvahd/loan_token_airdrop_coming_for_the_proton/,2,0,0,,positive

nnhoc6,Random: A Touch of Chaos in the Cryptosphere,FlexRVA21984,11,0,2021-05-29 06:56:10,"Do you love video games? Perhaps,  you prefer tabletops, or you’re a D&D purist? Maybe, you don't even like gaming and are just a crypto or NFT enthusiast looking for a fun community of people where you can learn, play, grow, and escape the neverending rat race of the world, at large? If any of this applies to you, then hou should check out Fractal Studios. 

What is Fractal Studios?

Fractal Studios, a new gaming company, is bringing an ingenious and unique vision to the cryptoverse. More than just a source of high quality games, Fractal Studios seeks to create an entire, online community that serves as an oasis from the daily stresses of the outside world. They are unlike any other project I have found. 

Discord: So Much More Than You'd Think

Their Discord is already really impressive, featuring channels ranging from Gameroom, a free and addictive casino, to Crypto, a discussion channel, to Gif Wars, an often hysterical stream of consciousness in gif form.  There's a channel dedicated to music where folks share what's in their rotation, at the moment. And, this is only the beginning. The team is in the process of developing Fractal Studios’ own Minecraft server, and one of the coolest things in the works is a mining method that revolves around education and answering questions!

Random Rules!

The team embraces the principles of chaos, and this is reflected  throughout Fractal Studios, but nowhere is it as apparent as in the unorthodox behavior of their token’s redistribution airdrops. Random (RNDM) is the native token for the Fractal Studios ecosystem. Built on the Binance Smart Chain network, RNDM, at first glance, looks like many other deflationary tokens, but the similarity soon gives way to stark contrasts.
Every Random transaction incurs a 3% fee. 66% of that (2%) goes to the redistribution wallet, and 33% (1%) goes to the burn wallet. The redistributions will be randomized amounts that fall within a set range. So, you'll always receive your redistribution reward, but it could be a different amount every time! It's almost like a lottery every time!

Plans

Fractal Studios has other exciting developments in the works. One is a randomized, ultra-rare NFT generator, which will be launching later this year. They have a clear roadmap including listings on larger exchanges. 

Summary 

Fractal Studios is truly one of the most exciting projects to come along in a while, IMO. I am invested. I'm not a wealthy man, but I feel confident in the success of the project. It has a fully doxxed, transparent team, and it's a cool idea that i think is exactly what crypto needs. 

Their pre-sale launched today. DYOR. Check them out for yourself.

o5mtbq,Dark time to be a crypto investor,None,1056,417,2021-06-22 13:10:43,"It is a hard time for all crypto investors right now. Literally everything is red, esp after it has been a hard couple weeks on the crypto markers. Many of us are holding bags, many of us have lost money that we couldn't afford to lose, some of us might not be able to pay rent or mortgages or possibly even buy food...

&#x200B;

Most of us invested in crypto to 'get rich' or at least escape poverty... weather we like to admit it or not we invest because we want a better life for ourselves, our family, our children etc

&#x200B;

Sure people who are on their high horse will say don't spend money you cant lose, dont over leverage, dont buy crypto, dont xyz - But that doesn't help in this moment and it isnt fair to be kicked when you're down.

&#x200B;

There have been many crashes in crypto and probably many more to come. I'm not here to tell you to Hold or buy the dip or even sell. I'm just here to tell you that you're not alone, tomorrow is another day.

&#x200B;

So where ever you are around the world, whatever you do just know others are all hurting just like you right now and we will be better investors for this experience and for those that are HODLing like me just know we will see better days again and not to give up on chasing a better financial future for yourself.

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

At least these platforms can guarantee a 100% freedom on investing in whatever assets I want, without the interference of any 3rd party. I have also read about a dex called Merrymen, and they are airdropping 20% of their tokens for investors of Robinhood, maybe I can benefit from that.

peteu0,Vertcoin 101,altitudemt8848,2,1,2021-08-30 23:03:03," **Disclaimer**: I have been in the crypto space since 2016; I HODL and mine Vertcoin, among other cryptos.

Now that's out of the way, I would like to take this opportunity to educate everyone here, both newcomers and veterans of cryptocurrency, about Vertcoin and the unique opportunity it presents for all of us.

What is Vertcoin?

Vertcoin (VTC) is an ASIC-resistant P2P Litecoin fork that uses Proof Of Work (POW) to reach a consensus. Billed as the 'The People's Coin,' the Vertcoin ascribes primacy to keeping its mining functions decentralized and seeks to allow anyone with a personal computer to join the Vertcoin network.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKW4GP7YqIc&t=2s) video describes what Vertcoin is perfectly. If you have some time, please watch it.

As you might have noticed, the key focus of Vertcoin is decentralization, and it tries to achieve it by making mining fair and available to everyone with a graphics card that has at least 2 Gb VRAM. It is also ASICS resistant and will remain that way. Every time an ASIC was detected on the network, it has forked to a new algorithm to boot them off the network and make it mineable via a GPU. As of this writing, that has happened 4 times, the last one being on Jan 2021 to Verthash.

What is ASIC, and why is Vertcoin against it?

An **application-specific integrated circuit** (**ASIC**) is an integrated circuit (IC) chip customized for a particular use rather than intended for general-purpose use like GPUs. It is designed to be very efficient at doing one thing and one thing only and enables a miner to mine a specific coin/token faster and efficiently, resulting in a better profit.

**But, wait, that doesn't sound so bad at all.**

Well, it isn't straightforward, and here is why. Even though ASIC in the paper is efficient and more profitable, it is costly, and even if you can afford to buy one, you are not getting the best one available. Let me elaborate, ASIC costs a lot of money to develop and produce, somewhere between hundreds of thousands to multi-millions. The companies producing these ASICs use them to mine a coin first before selling them to others. This means you are either getting a used ASIC miner or an older version of it. If you can shell out tens of millions of dollars, you might be able to get unused and latest ASIC miners, which means only the rich can profitably use these ASICs to mine, leaving the little guy out of the picture.

The only way for us average users to buy these coins/tokens is from those ASIC producers or big mining farms. The consumer does not say what happens to the coin as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned when he said one CPU one vote. The prime example of this is the Bitcoin fork to Bitcoin Cash. You can read more about it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-cash.asp#:~:text=Bitcoin%20Cash%20is%20the%20result,transactions%20into%20a%20single%20block).

Because of the reasons above, Vertcoin was created in 2014 from a fork of Litecoin's codebase. It kept all the parameters of Litecoin, such as max block size (**1MB**), average block time (2.5 mins), and max supply (84 million). However, the algorithm for mining was changed so that it's profitable to mine via a consumer-grade GPU to this day.

Relation between Vertcoin and Bitcoin:

Vertcoin was forked off of Litecoin's code which was a fork of Bitcoin's code; therefore, they are closely related. You can think of Vertcoin as a first cousin of Bitcoin. Since the code is very similar, any updates/upgrades done to Bitcoin can also be ported to Vertcoin, for example, SegWit (Fun fact Vertcoin activated SegWit before Bitcoin on its network). Developers constantly port the changes to Bitcoin's code over to Vertcoin regularly. This makes Vertcoin the closest thing to a GPU mineable Bitcoin. So close that they are Atomic Swap, submarine swap, and Lightning network compatible.

**Atomic Swap:**

An atomic swap is a [smart contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) technology that enables exchanging one cryptocurrency for another without using centralized intermediaries, such as exchanges. This means no KYC no exchanges as Cryptocurrencies were supposed to be. You can learn more about atomic swap [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp#:~:text=An%20atomic%20swap%20is%20a,centralized%20intermediaries%2C%20such%20as%20exchanges.&text=They%20first%20came%20into%20prominence,Decred%20and%20Litecoin%20was%20conducted).

**Submarine Swap:**

Submarine Swaps are atomic on-chain to off-chain swaps (and vice versa, often called Reverse Submarine Swaps) of cryptocurrencies. Again, no KYC and exchanges here either. Read more about Submarine Swap [here](https://medium.com/suredbits/how-do-submarine-swaps-work-907ed0d91498). Vertcoin is the only coin that has demonstrated to work with Submarine swap, AFAIK. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKvw0q6_yhY) is video proof of Submarine Swap between on-chain Vertcoin and off-chain Lightning Network Bitcoin.

**Lightning Network:**

The lightning network is a second layer technology applied to bitcoin that uses micropayment channels to scale its blockchain to conduct transactions more efficiently. You can learn more about the lightning network [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp).

Mining Vertcoin:

Decentralized mining is the key goal of Vertcoin and will always be its top priority above anything else. Since the recent fork to Verthash, anyone can mine Vertcoin at home using their PC profitably. Even though it's not as profitable as Ethereum to mine now, once ETH moves to the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus, I expect Vertcoin to be more profitable to mine in the coming days.

Recently released One-Click Miner 2.0 makes it ridiculously easy to mine Vertcoin. It is truly one click, and all the overhead of mining, like creating a wallet, connecting to the best pool, are taken care of automatically. In addition, a new iteration of OCM is being worked on, letting you swap your mined Vertcoin's to LN BTC from within the miner itself. Although it's still in beta, it's been proven to work without any issues.

The biggest problem with mining using your PC is that you cannot use it while mining, let alone play games. However, the new mining algorithm Verthash spectacularly solves this problem. As a result, not only can you use your PC while mining (I am currently typing this post from my PC while also mining Vertcoin), you can also play nongraphics intensive games like Minecraft, League of Legends, Dota, etc. without any significant performance impact. Check out [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/vertcoin/comments/lgh6zk/playing_games_while_mining_vertcoin_5_games_tested/) post for an example.

Another benefit of Verthash is that you can underclock your GPU's core and reduce the power limit; doing so will not affect mining at all and keep your GPU running cooler, and you will be able to use it for longer. For example, my GPU never sees more than 65c while mining fans are quiet, and even on a hot day, the temperature of the GPU never goes significantly higher.

Verthash is memory intensive which means developing an ASIC is rather hard. Therefore, if one is ever developed, it will not have a significant performance improvement compared to a GPU.

If you are interested in mining Vertcoin, head over to [vertcoin.org](https://vertcoin.org/) and download their One-click miner. Here is what you need to do after you have downloaded OCM.

1. Extract the zip file
2. Add the exe file to the windows defender/AV exclude list. (If you don't do this, it might get flagged as malware, rest assure it is not. Every mining software is flagged as such, and it's a false positive. However, if you don't trust me and want to find out for yourself, the [code](https://github.com/vertcoin-project/one-click-miner-vnext) is open-source, and you can have a look at it for yourself. Also, try to compile it yourself if you know how.)
3. Launch the OCM by clicking on the exe file
4. Please enter the password for the wallet and remember to note it down somewhere. You will need it to send funds to other wallets. If you forget it, there is no way to retrieve it later.

That's it; you are now mining Vertcoin. Next time you want to start mining, click on the exe file, and you are all set.

51% attack:

sadly, Vertcoin has had two 51% attacks in the past. Even though they weren't profitable for the attackers, it is still a big deal. Unfortunately, there is nothing developers can do to remedy that. The only way to prevent the next attack is to get enough miners on the network to make it impossible or unprofitable. However, there is some good news. The last two attacks were conducted by renting hashpower from Nicehash. Fortunately, it is no longer possible since Nicehash has publicly stated that they will not be supporting Verthash on their platform. [Here](https://twitter.com/NiceHashMining/status/1346732981587746817) is the proof.

**Fairness:**

* No pre-mine: Vertcoin has been fairly mined since its inception, and developers do not hold many coins. Every coin was distributed among miners for securing the network.
* No airdrop: Being a minable coin, this is impossible unless there was a large pre-mine, which is not the case with Vertcoin.
* No ICO: No pre-mine means this is not possible either.

Marketing and Exchange listing:

Since Vertcoin is a community-funded project maintained by volunteers with no pre-mine, there isn't enough money for wide-scale marketing. That is why you don't see tons of bots awarding and upvoting every single post in Reddit forums and other social media platforms. Furthermore, because of the lack of funding marketing team cannot run digitals ads or pay influencers to promote Vertcoin; that is why it is overshadowed by other crypto projects, both genuine and scams.

Vertcoin is only listed in four bigger exchanges, Bittrex, Changelly pro, Hitbtc, and Bitvavo (Only for Europe). Every exchange contacted by the marketing team or the volunteers asks huge sums of money for listing, which they don't have.

Future:

I cannot tell you what the future holds for Vertcoin, but I can tell you this much, developers will keep working on it to make sure it is up to date with Bitcoin and ASIC resistant; the community will always support and mine it.

I also have some predictions based on current events, and they are as follows:

* More miners will start mining Vertcoin after ETH move to POS
* If the lightning network takes off or another layer 2 solutions is developed for Bitcoin, Vertcoin will always be compatible with it and might fill in gaps where Bitcoin lacks.
* There will be solutions developed to make it easier to convert Vertcoin to Bitcoin and vice versa without a centralized entity like exchanges and KYC.
* When Bitcoin goes mainstream and everyone is using it in their daily lives, we will still be able to mine Vertcoin with our PC and convert it to on-chain Bitcoin or off-chain Bitcoin and have a reliable source of income.

I hope this post helped you understand what Vertcoin is and what makes it special. When scams are rampant, and it's hard for us to find out which crypto is genuine, I wanted to shine some light on the crypto that brought me to mining and taught me a lot about cryptocurrency and the future of finance.

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Koinos.io

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

FAQ

How decentralized is Koinos?
Koinos is not a blockchain, it is a blockchain building technology (think Hyperledger, Cosmos, Polkadot) that makes it an order of magnitude faster and easier to launch high performance blockchains that are capable of evolution. It is the core technology engineered to advance our mission to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future.
This step up improvement in ease of use for developers is accomplished through the engineering of a framework that allows for any feature of a Koinos blockchain to be added or modified simply by writing smart contracts in the most used programming languages in the world (C++, TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.) and uploading them to the blockchain.
Making it far easier for developers to launch their own blockchains with unique value propositions does have important implications as far as the decentralization of the ecosystem because the more options people have, the more decentralized the ecosystem.

What is the TPS (transactions per second)?
This is another question we get a lot and it highlights again the common misunderstanding people have about Koinos. Koinos is a blockchain framework. A minimum viable blockchain waiting to get features from smart contracts that are uploaded by developers. How many transactions a given blockchain can process per second is a function of its block size and its block time (how frequently it produces blocks) which will be parameters that are set by developers launching Koinos blockchains.
Yes, Koinos Group is designing a flagship implementation of the Koinos blockchain framework (the “mainnet”), but we are still primarily working on the blockchain framework. Believe it or not, the hard part of building a blockchain is building the framework. Writing smart contracts is relatively fast and easy for software engineers with the level of experience and skill that we have, that’s exactly why we designed Koinos to take full advantage of smart contracts! The problem we found when we began this journey is that all of the existing blockchain frameworks were remarkably difficult to use.
We knew we could work with them, but we wanted anyone to be able to boot up their own blockchain in seconds, not months or years. We knew it was possible, but it was almost like the people who were creating these frameworks didn’t want other people using them to build competing blockchains.

What about the KOIN ERC20? ICO? Pre-Mine?
Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future, NOT to launch a token that moons and retire to some tropical island. We launched the KOIN ERC20 as a proof of work mineable token on the Ethereum blockchain to pre-seed the Koinos ecosystem with a base level of decentralization. This means that the only way to acquire KOIN was through PoW mining or open market purchases so there was no pre-mine, ICO, IEO, or any other IxO (lol).
It is a game wherein people can sacrifice computational work to prove to one another their commitment to a shared mission and vision for the future of blockchain. Once Koinos mainnet launches, the ERC20 will cease to provide this value, and instead the mainnet token will be a better tool for bootstrapping the decentralization of a new dApp or Koinos-based blockchain.
We believe that the key to accomplishing our mission is making it faster, easier, and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. We believe that competition is healthy and the more blockchains there are meeting the wide variety of user needs, the better. The Koinos blockchain framework is engineered to become the most used blockchain framework in the space. The KOIN ERC20 can be an asset to any Koinos-blockchain developer, not just Koinos Group.

But what about Mainnet?!!!
The most innovative component of Koinos is what we call “modular upgradeability.” Moving the entire system into smart contracts, allows blockchain developers like us to write system features orders of magnitude faster.
We haven’t disclosed details about the Koinos mainnet features because we haven’t started working on them yet. These are the features that most people are interested in (consensus algorithm, governance system, staking mechanism, resource system, etc.). We have internal designs of these systems that we have been refining as we developed the framework, but these will likely change as we begin implementing them in smart contracts. That’s why we will only disclose these details as we begin working on those smart contracts in the coming months so be sure to follow us for updates. But again, these features are optimized for efficiency, flexibility, and most importantly decentralization, not impressing people with large-but-meaningless numbers.
The reason to be interested in Koinos is not because of the high level features (like TPS). Such focus misses the entire point of Koinos. Even on a public Koinos-based blockchain, all the most important features can be upgraded by governance at any point without a hard fork, meaning that any high level feature is likely to change!
Koinos is not optimized for any specific high level feature, it is optimized to improve at a more rapid rate than any other blockchain.
In the context of TPS, that means our goal is not to launch with the highest number, but to increase that number over time (if desirable) through optimizations and upgrades.

How is the team funded? Can you survive for the coming 3+ years?
Koinos Group is a private company started by the core development team behind the Steem blockchain to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future by focusing on accessibility. This team worked together for 4+ years at Steemit on the Steem blockchain, at the time the most accessible blockchain by orders of magnitude, and we have now been working together for nearly 2 years on Koinos. Every member of Koinos Group has been working solely for equity in the company, which means they believe in the product and the business plan, and have a vested interest in seeing both the platform and the company succeed.
Koinos Group had to acquire its KOIN like everyone else through either PoW mining or open market purchases, making it impossible to confuse holding KOIN as any kind of investment in Koinos Group. We had to acquire our KOIN at a loss and will only recoup that loss by adding value to the Koinos ecosystem and Koinos Group. This aligns our incentives with the incentives of the Koinos community.
We believe very much in our business model which is based on offering valuable developer tooling that will make it faster, easier and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. Koinos is our secret weapon for delivering unbeatable products and services, and we know it better than anyone else because we built it. We believe that Koinos Group could generate incredible revenue and profit margins and it is this profit potential that serves as the incentive for Koinos Group members. In this sense Koinos Group is modeled after a more traditional tech startup.
Increasing the value of Koinos (which is not the same as increasing the price of KOIN which we do not comment on) is fundamental to our business model, but it is NOT the source of our revenue. Currently Koinos Group does not generate revenue, but thanks to the incredible talent of our founding team members, our operating expenses are very low.
We are also exploring fundraising opportunities by looking for investors who believe in our business model, not people who are looking to speculate on the KOIN price which is more efficiently done through open markets and has nothing to do with our business model.
We have acquired our KOIN like any other developer to ensure that we have access to the computational capacity our developers and their users will need to use the amazing decentralized applications we expect to see on Koinos owing to its free accounts, free transfers, and free smart contracts.

What is the scaling mechanism?
Another way to think about Koinos is that it is a blockchain optimized for flexibility. Some blockchains are built to scale using sharding. Some are focused on interchain communication. Some are focused on other supposed scaling “solutions.” Scaling is a process, not a problem that is ever “solved.” Koinos is designed to leverage any or all of these systems if and when necessary, and if desired by on-chain governance.
Other blockchain projects take a top-down approach, deciding at the beginning what the “right” solution is and then specifically architecting their blockchain to implement those solutions. This might sound good to people who don’t understand proper system design, but it is highly constraining and means that there is a very clear path to defeat; picking the wrong solution. No developer is perfect, so engineering yourself into a corner is never a good idea.
This approach also leaves no room for developer feedback because the system is already designed before the developer ever gets involved. It leaves no room for new technological innovations because it is impossible to predict what innovations will come in the future or when they will be sufficiently adopted to justify integration.
Koinos is not optimized for any high level feature (like “scaling”). Koinos is a blockchain-based protocol optimized to rapidly integrate the most innovative technologies as they emerge. Yes, this is fundamentally different than any other blockchain protocol in existence which makes it difficult for people to wrap their minds around its value. We are working hard to figure out better ways to communicate this value which is why we appreciate people asking these kinds of questions.
There are many interesting, important, and challenging problems that many amazing open source teams are working to solve. But the beauty of open source is that once those solutions exist, we all get to take advantage of them. We believe very much in the open source ethos and its power to deliver incredible innovations. We ourselves are working to deliver a very powerful open source solution that any developer can use to leverage the power of blockchain within their application.
Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) so many teams design their systems in ways that limit their ability to take advantage of the unlimited value that continuously emerges from the open source community.
The problem we are trying to solve is how to make those technologies available to blockchain developers the moment that they’re ready which also means using our expertise to assess whether a given technology is ready or not. It is far too frequently the case that developers will begin building on a solution long before it is ready simply because it claims to solve some important problem. This is incredibly risky for both themselves and their users. It is choosing to trust a (often anonymous) team when the whole point of decentralized solutions is to be trustless. A perfect example of this right now is the prevalence of cross-chain bridges. Very few, if any, of these are secure.
As the first, and flagship, implementation of Koinos the mainnet will be like an “innovation vacuum” sucking in the best technologies as they emerge and become secure. That will be the source of its value. Lots of people are working on scaling solutions, and as with any important feature, we are researching those solutions. Our goal will be to make all the best solutions available to Koinos blockchain developers, not pick any specific one and certainly not to develop one ourselves.
Developing novel solutions is a big red flag that either Koinos is not sufficiently flexible, or that no good solution already exists, meaning it’s an extremely difficult or impossible problem to solve. We’re not saying we won’t ever develop novel solutions, but our goal is to minimize them and ensure that those solutions increase the flexibility of Koinos while advancing our mission of accelerating the transition to a more decentralized future.
Far too often teams develop novel solutions as a marketing exercise which is not just a recipe for failure, it demonstrates a cynical world view that we do not share. We believe that people are ready for decentralized solutions that make their lives better. We’re focused on empowering developers to build those solutions and anything that distracts from that mission is unacceptable.

What about composability?
Now this is a question I can answer in a straightforward fashion (lol)! Koinos has the highest degree of composability possible because it is the only blockchain framework to move all of the system logic into smart contracts. When we’re talking about composability in the blockchain context, what we are talking about is the ability for decentralized application developers to repurpose code that is already running on the blockchain within their applications (i.e. to “compose” their applications).
Most blockchains that claim “high composability” are just saying that they don’t have sharding, which is an attempt to rebrand a limitation as a value-add. As I’ve explained ad nauseum, Koinos is optimized for flexibility which means that it could shard, or not shard, based on the smart contracts that are running on it.
As far as composability on Koinos, because all of the system logic is contained in smart contract modules, application developers will be able to not just repurpose the smart contracts written by other dApp developers, they’ll be able to repurpose the code written by the most experienced blockchain engineers in the world; the engineers building Koinos-based blockchains.
Mainnet will just be the first Koinos-based blockchain, so as more engineers launch more Koinos-based blockchains, even more system contracts will be running on Koinos giving dApp developers even more high quality smart contracts to draw from.
But wait there’s more! Because these smart contracts will be written in an ever growing number of the most used programming languages in the world, developers won’t just be able to find the perfect smart contract for their needs, they will be able to find smart contracts written in their preferred programming language! This takes the composability of Koinos, already far greater than any other protocol, to an entirely new level!

pums42,Aurum Project Update 23rd September 2021-Important Announcement,Opposite_Peanut_9923,15,12,2021-09-24 16:01:09,"***Key changes summarised:***

**LOWER SUPPLY**\- Gone are the days of quadrillions and an endless amount of zeros - they will be proportionally reducing their supply from 1 quadrillion to 1 billion — everyone will get the exact same percentage holding proportionally — so your holdings will be worth the exact same.

**REDUCED TAX-** It was known that the current high tax rates have been a deterrent for many new buyers — this will now been reduced down to 10% which is particularly important since utility coins rarely have high taxes.

**REDUCED GAS FEES-** They have fully optimised many of the smart contract features to cut gas fees significantly making trading and getting rewarded by $AUR much more efficient.

**LOWER MINIMUM THRESHOLD TO RECEIVE REWARDS-** They have listened to investor feedback regarding the minimum holding to receive rewards. This will now be over 90% lower, from what is current 11billion to 1 billion AUR — this will be 1000 AUR on the upgraded contract.

**DYNAMIC RESPONSIVE TAX SYSTEM-** They will be able to adjust their taxes to increase/decrease rewards, marketing, buybacks according to the needs of the community.

https://preview.redd.it/cqqvhupp4hp71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7fdb01b7153c3715316d4b578c506ae32466452

***The Migration Process:***

All holders will automatically be airdropped the new token in the following ratio with no minimum holding requirement and no restrictions (to reflect the total supply changing):

NEW TOKEN : OLD TOKEN

1 : 1.000.000

Please note your new holding will have exactly the same value as your previous holding from when they halt transactions to when they redeploy since you will retain the same percentage of the total supply.

***Aurum Contract Upgrade:*** what I would like to know:

*Why are they relaunching again?*

This is **not** a relaunch. Yes, they are upgrading their Smart Contract but everything else will remain the same — their name, branding, product developments, roadmap etc.

*When will this be happening?*

They are waiting upon Solidity Finance to finish auditing the new contract — they will then rearrange a new date for ApeSwap listing and deployment of the new contract. They will announce dates on all of their socials once this is all confirmed.

*What do I need to do to get the new token?*

Nothing — other than add the new contract address on Trust Wallet or Metamask. Bitmart holders should automatically receive the upgraded AUR in their wallet.

*Why will I get less tokens? What will my new tokens be worth?*

Investors will receive the exact same percentage of the total supply as they held before. This means the value of their holdings from when Aurum stop transactions to when they redeploy on the new contract will be the same .

*Why have rewards percentages been lowered?*

High percentage rewards can be very lucrative but only if trading volume is present. Aurum strongly believe that having lower taxes overall will be more attractive to new investors and generate greater net rewards overall. On top of this, due to their dynamic tax system, they have the option of increasing rewards percentages as and when required (i.e. double rewards week promotions) so they can actually have limited periods where they set rewards higher than they were previously.

*What if you change the dynamic taxes to 100%?*

Their dynamic tax system is capped at 20% - it can never go higher than this.

*Will this affect Aurum Wallet development or release?*

No — Aurum Wallet is being developed completely separately and contract upgrade will not affect this.

*What's happening with the Aurum Wallet development?*

* Having resubmitted their latest build to Google Web Store — the Phase 1 Beta of the Aurum Wallet release is finally upon us. Privacy Policy and Storage Permissions have been addressed and they will be revealing the release date shortly.
* They apologise for the delays and in future will not be setting any exact release dates until they are confident they can fully and comprehensively meet those deadlines.
* This release will be accompanied by a Wallet Roadmap- detailing future features being included in the upcoming updates and approximate timelines.

*What's up with the Aurum Pressure Vault?*

After a sustained battle, Admonkey has taken this week’s Aurum Pressure Vault top spot, earning themselves the buying pressure from the Gold Pressure Vault and the top featured spot on the *Rewards dashboard.*

*How is the Web development going?*

* The design of the mobile version of the new website is being finalised this week. The last pieces of website content are currently being written. They now have two web developers ready to begin the coding stage to react which is estimated to take around 4 weeks.
* Mock up designs of the new Rewards Dashboard Dapp design have been completed. They will be looking to integrate this into the new website.

*Are you developing more Partnerships?*

Once the Solidity Finance audit of the new Smart Contract is complete, they will be able to set an official date for ApeSwap partnership and listing.

They will be announcing the partnership they have with the Top 20 project on Monday 27th September!

*Are you preparing a marketing campaign?*

* They have prepared more press releases in Tier 1 publications, scheduled for their upcoming partnerships and wallet release.
* Aurum will also be invited for an AMA within the ApeSwap Reddit community and be featured on the ApeSwap socials (with over 150k followers).
* Further strategies and actions ahead of full release of wallet will be rolled out gradually as per last week’s AMA update — CMC airdrop, Crypto Twitter influencers, Crypto Youtubers, giveaways etc.

*Do you have more charity donations planned?*

After the $1000 donation to Kids In Need of Defence, the next charity shortlisted for a community chosen donation will be World Orphans added to the existing charities: Sea Sheppard[ ](https://www.seashepherd.org.uk/)and Direct Relief. Voting will be undertaken on their Twitter page this week.

***Aurum have a LIVE Twitch AMA on Tuesday 28th September detailing their future partnerships, listings and Wallet release date!***

Koinos.io

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people’s lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won’t just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won’t launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call “modular upgradeability” which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we’re developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we’re not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that’s mainly because we don’t know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It’s just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven’t yet, and what we just don’t know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit if such changes are approved by governance.

FAQ

How decentralized is Koinos?
Koinos is not a blockchain, it is a blockchain building technology (think Hyperledger, Cosmos, Polkadot) that makes it an order of magnitude faster and easier to launch high performance blockchains that are capable of evolution. It is the core technology engineered to advance our mission to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future.
This step up improvement in ease of use for developers is accomplished through the engineering of a framework that allows for any feature of a Koinos blockchain to be added or modified simply by writing smart contracts in the most used programming languages in the world (C++, TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.) and uploading them to the blockchain.
Making it far easier for developers to launch their own blockchains with unique value propositions does have important implications as far as the decentralization of the ecosystem because the more options people have, the more decentralized the ecosystem.

What is the TPS (transactions per second)?
This is another question we get a lot and it highlights again the common misunderstanding people have about Koinos. Koinos is a blockchain framework. A minimum viable blockchain waiting to get features from smart contracts that are uploaded by developers. How many transactions a given blockchain can process per second is a function of its block size and its block time (how frequently it produces blocks) which will be parameters that are set by developers launching Koinos blockchains.
Yes, Koinos Group is designing a flagship implementation of the Koinos blockchain framework (the “mainnet”), but we are still primarily working on the blockchain framework. Believe it or not, the hard part of building a blockchain is building the framework. Writing smart contracts is relatively fast and easy for software engineers with the level of experience and skill that we have, that’s exactly why we designed Koinos to take full advantage of smart contracts! The problem we found when we began this journey is that all of the existing blockchain frameworks were remarkably difficult to use.
We knew we could work with them, but we wanted anyone to be able to boot up their own blockchain in seconds, not months or years. We knew it was possible, but it was almost like the people who were creating these frameworks didn’t want other people using them to build competing blockchains.

What about the KOIN ERC20? ICO? Pre-Mine?
Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future, NOT to launch a token that moons and retire to some tropical island. We launched the KOIN ERC20 as a proof of work mineable token on the Ethereum blockchain to pre-seed the Koinos ecosystem with a base level of decentralization. This means that the only way to acquire KOIN was through PoW mining or open market purchases so there was no pre-mine, ICO, IEO, or any other IxO (lol).
It is a game wherein people can sacrifice computational work to prove to one another their commitment to a shared mission and vision for the future of blockchain. Once Koinos mainnet launches, the ERC20 will cease to provide this value, and instead the mainnet token will be a better tool for bootstrapping the decentralization of a new dApp or Koinos-based blockchain.
We believe that the key to accomplishing our mission is making it faster, easier, and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. We believe that competition is healthy and the more blockchains there are meeting the wide variety of user needs, the better. The Koinos blockchain framework is engineered to become the most used blockchain framework in the space. The KOIN ERC20 can be an asset to any Koinos-blockchain developer, not just Koinos Group.

But what about Mainnet?!!!
The most innovative component of Koinos is what we call “modular upgradeability.” Moving the entire system into smart contracts, allows blockchain developers like us to write system features orders of magnitude faster.
We haven’t disclosed details about the Koinos mainnet features because we haven’t started working on them yet. These are the features that most people are interested in (consensus algorithm, governance system, staking mechanism, resource system, etc.). We have internal designs of these systems that we have been refining as we developed the framework, but these will likely change as we begin implementing them in smart contracts. That’s why we will only disclose these details as we begin working on those smart contracts in the coming months so be sure to follow us for updates. But again, these features are optimized for efficiency, flexibility, and most importantly decentralization, not impressing people with large-but-meaningless numbers.
The reason to be interested in Koinos is not because of the high level features (like TPS). Such focus misses the entire point of Koinos. Even on a public Koinos-based blockchain, all the most important features can be upgraded by governance at any point without a hard fork, meaning that any high level feature is likely to change!
Koinos is not optimized for any specific high level feature, it is optimized to improve at a more rapid rate than any other blockchain.
In the context of TPS, that means our goal is not to launch with the highest number, but to increase that number over time (if desirable) through optimizations and upgrades.

How is the team funded? Can you survive for the coming 3+ years?
Koinos Group is a private company started by the core development team behind the Steem blockchain to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future by focusing on accessibility. This team worked together for 4+ years at Steemit on the Steem blockchain, at the time the most accessible blockchain by orders of magnitude, and we have now been working together for nearly 2 years on Koinos. Every member of Koinos Group has been working solely for equity in the company, which means they believe in the product and the business plan, and have a vested interest in seeing both the platform and the company succeed.
Koinos Group had to acquire its KOIN like everyone else through either PoW mining or open market purchases, making it impossible to confuse holding KOIN as any kind of investment in Koinos Group. We had to acquire our KOIN at a loss and will only recoup that loss by adding value to the Koinos ecosystem and Koinos Group. This aligns our incentives with the incentives of the Koinos community.
We believe very much in our business model which is based on offering valuable developer tooling that will make it faster, easier and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. Koinos is our secret weapon for delivering unbeatable products and services, and we know it better than anyone else because we built it. We believe that Koinos Group could generate incredible revenue and profit margins and it is this profit potential that serves as the incentive for Koinos Group members. In this sense Koinos Group is modeled after a more traditional tech startup.
Increasing the value of Koinos (which is not the same as increasing the price of KOIN which we do not comment on) is fundamental to our business model, but it is NOT the source of our revenue. Currently Koinos Group does not generate revenue, but thanks to the incredible talent of our founding team members, our operating expenses are very low.
We are also exploring fundraising opportunities by looking for investors who believe in our business model, not people who are looking to speculate on the KOIN price which is more efficiently done through open markets and has nothing to do with our business model.
We have acquired our KOIN like any other developer to ensure that we have access to the computational capacity our developers and their users will need to use the amazing decentralized applications we expect to see on Koinos owing to its free accounts, free transfers, and free smart contracts.

What is the scaling mechanism?
Another way to think about Koinos is that it is a blockchain optimized for flexibility. Some blockchains are built to scale using sharding. Some are focused on interchain communication. Some are focused on other supposed scaling “solutions.” Scaling is a process, not a problem that is ever “solved.” Koinos is designed to leverage any or all of these systems if and when necessary, and if desired by on-chain governance.
Other blockchain projects take a top-down approach, deciding at the beginning what the “right” solution is and then specifically architecting their blockchain to implement those solutions. This might sound good to people who don’t understand proper system design, but it is highly constraining and means that there is a very clear path to defeat; picking the wrong solution. No developer is perfect, so engineering yourself into a corner is never a good idea.
This approach also leaves no room for developer feedback because the system is already designed before the developer ever gets involved. It leaves no room for new technological innovations because it is impossible to predict what innovations will come in the future or when they will be sufficiently adopted to justify integration.
Koinos is not optimized for any high level feature (like “scaling”). Koinos is a blockchain-based protocol optimized to rapidly integrate the most innovative technologies as they emerge. Yes, this is fundamentally different than any other blockchain protocol in existence which makes it difficult for people to wrap their minds around its value. We are working hard to figure out better ways to communicate this value which is why we appreciate people asking these kinds of questions.
There are many interesting, important, and challenging problems that many amazing open source teams are working to solve. But the beauty of open source is that once those solutions exist, we all get to take advantage of them. We believe very much in the open source ethos and its power to deliver incredible innovations. We ourselves are working to deliver a very powerful open source solution that any developer can use to leverage the power of blockchain within their application.
Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) so many teams design their systems in ways that limit their ability to take advantage of the unlimited value that continuously emerges from the open source community.
The problem we are trying to solve is how to make those technologies available to blockchain developers the moment that they’re ready which also means using our expertise to assess whether a given technology is ready or not. It is far too frequently the case that developers will begin building on a solution long before it is ready simply because it claims to solve some important problem. This is incredibly risky for both themselves and their users. It is choosing to trust a (often anonymous) team when the whole point of decentralized solutions is to be trustless. A perfect example of this right now is the prevalence of cross-chain bridges. Very few, if any, of these are secure.
As the first, and flagship, implementation of Koinos the mainnet will be like an “innovation vacuum” sucking in the best technologies as they emerge and become secure. That will be the source of its value. Lots of people are working on scaling solutions, and as with any important feature, we are researching those solutions. Our goal will be to make all the best solutions available to Koinos blockchain developers, not pick any specific one and certainly not to develop one ourselves.
Developing novel solutions is a big red flag that either Koinos is not sufficiently flexible, or that no good solution already exists, meaning it’s an extremely difficult or impossible problem to solve. We’re not saying we won’t ever develop novel solutions, but our goal is to minimize them and ensure that those solutions increase the flexibility of Koinos while advancing our mission of accelerating the transition to a more decentralized future.
Far too often teams develop novel solutions as a marketing exercise which is not just a recipe for failure, it demonstrates a cynical world view that we do not share. We believe that people are ready for decentralized solutions that make their lives better. We’re focused on empowering developers to build those solutions and anything that distracts from that mission is unacceptable.

What about composability?
Now this is a question I can answer in a straightforward fashion (lol)! Koinos has the highest degree of composability possible because it is the only blockchain framework to move all of the system logic into smart contracts. When we’re talking about composability in the blockchain context, what we are talking about is the ability for decentralized application developers to repurpose code that is already running on the blockchain within their applications (i.e. to “compose” their applications).
Most blockchains that claim “high composability” are just saying that they don’t have sharding, which is an attempt to rebrand a limitation as a value-add. As I’ve explained ad nauseum, Koinos is optimized for flexibility which means that it could shard, or not shard, based on the smart contracts that are running on it.
As far as composability on Koinos, because all of the system logic is contained in smart contract modules, application developers will be able to not just repurpose the smart contracts written by other dApp developers, they’ll be able to repurpose the code written by the most experienced blockchain engineers in the world; the engineers building Koinos-based blockchains.
Mainnet will just be the first Koinos-based blockchain, so as more engineers launch more Koinos-based blockchains, even more system contracts will be running on Koinos giving dApp developers even more high quality smart contracts to draw from.
But wait there’s more! Because these smart contracts will be written in an ever growing number of the most used programming languages in the world, developers won’t just be able to find the perfect smart contract for their needs, they will be able to find smart contracts written in their preferred programming language! This takes the composability of Koinos, already far greater than any other protocol, to an entirely new level!

Writing smart contracts is relatively fast and easy for software engineers with the level of experience and skill that we have, that’s exactly why we designed Koinos to take full advantage of smart contracts! The problem we found when we began this journey is that all of the existing blockchain frameworks were remarkably difficult to use.
We knew we could work with them, but we wanted anyone to be able to boot up their own blockchain in seconds, not months or years. We knew it was possible, but it was almost like the people who were creating these frameworks didn’t want other people using them to build competing blockchains.

What about the KOIN ERC20? ICO? Pre-Mine?
Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future, NOT to launch a token that moons and retire to some tropical island. We launched the KOIN ERC20 as a proof of work mineable token on the Ethereum blockchain to pre-seed the Koinos ecosystem with a base level of decentralization. This means that the only way to acquire KOIN was through PoW mining or open market purchases so there was no pre-mine, ICO, IEO, or any other IxO (lol).
It is a game wherein people can sacrifice computational work to prove to one another their commitment to a shared mission and vision for the future of blockchain. Once Koinos mainnet launches, the ERC20 will cease to provide this value, and instead the mainnet token will be a better tool for bootstrapping the decentralization of a new dApp or Koinos-based blockchain.
We believe that the key to accomplishing our mission is making it faster, easier, and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. We believe that competition is healthy and the more blockchains there are meeting the wide variety of user needs, the better. The Koinos blockchain framework is engineered to become the most used blockchain framework in the space. The KOIN ERC20 can be an asset to any Koinos-blockchain developer, not just Koinos Group.

But what about Mainnet?!!!
The most innovative component of Koinos is what we call “modular upgradeability.” Moving the entire system into smart contracts, allows blockchain developers like us to write system features orders of magnitude faster.
We haven’t disclosed details about the Koinos mainnet features because we haven’t started working on them yet. These are the features that most people are interested in (consensus algorithm, governance system, staking mechanism, resource system, etc.). We have internal designs of these systems that we have been refining as we developed the framework, but these will likely change as we begin implementing them in smart contracts. That’s why we will only disclose these details as we begin working on those smart contracts in the coming months so be sure to follow us for updates. But again, these features are optimized for efficiency, flexibility, and most importantly decentralization, not impressing people with large-but-meaningless numbers.
The reason to be interested in Koinos is not because of the high level features (like TPS). Such focus misses the entire point of Koinos. Even on a public Koinos-based blockchain, all the most important features can be upgraded by governance at any point without a hard fork, meaning that any high level feature is likely to change!
Koinos is not optimized for any specific high level feature, it is optimized to improve at a more rapid rate than any other blockchain.
In the context of TPS, that means our goal is not to launch with the highest number, but to increase that number over time (if desirable) through optimizations and upgrades.

How is the team funded? Can you survive for the coming 3+ years?
Koinos Group is a private company started by the core development team behind the Steem blockchain to accelerate the transition to a more decentralized future by focusing on accessibility. This team worked together for 4+ years at Steemit on the Steem blockchain, at the time the most accessible blockchain by orders of magnitude, and we have now been working together for nearly 2 years on Koinos. Every member of Koinos Group has been working solely for equity in the company, which means they believe in the product and the business plan, and have a vested interest in seeing both the platform and the company succeed.
Koinos Group had to acquire its KOIN like everyone else through either PoW mining or open market purchases, making it impossible to confuse holding KOIN as any kind of investment in Koinos Group. We had to acquire our KOIN at a loss and will only recoup that loss by adding value to the Koinos ecosystem and Koinos Group. This aligns our incentives with the incentives of the Koinos community.
We believe very much in our business model which is based on offering valuable developer tooling that will make it faster, easier and more profitable to launch blockchain-based applications. Koinos is our secret weapon for delivering unbeatable products and services, and we know it better than anyone else because we built it. We believe that Koinos Group could generate incredible revenue and profit margins and it is this profit potential that serves as the incentive for Koinos Group members. In this sense Koinos Group is modeled after a more traditional tech startup.
Increasing the value of Koinos (which is not the same as increasing the price of KOIN which we do not comment on) is fundamental to our business model, but it is NOT the source of our revenue. Currently Koinos Group does not generate revenue, but thanks to the incredible talent of our founding team members, our operating expenses are very low.
We are also exploring fundraising opportunities by looking for investors who believe in our business model, not people who are looking to speculate on the KOIN price which is more efficiently done through open markets and has nothing to do with our business model.
We have acquired our KOIN like any other developer to ensure that we have access to the computational capacity our developers and their users will need to use the amazing decentralized applications we expect to see on Koinos owing to its free accounts, free transfers, and free smart contracts.

What is the scaling mechanism?
Another way to think about Koinos is that it is a blockchain optimized for flexibility. Some blockchains are built to scale using sharding. Some are focused on interchain communication. Some are focused on other supposed scaling “solutions.” Scaling is a process, not a problem that is ever “solved.” Koinos is designed to leverage any or all of these systems if and when necessary, and if desired by on-chain governance.
Other blockchain projects take a top-down approach, deciding at the beginning what the “right” solution is and then specifically architecting their blockchain to implement those solutions. This might sound good to people who don’t understand proper system design, but it is highly constraining and means that there is a very clear path to defeat; picking the wrong solution. No developer is perfect, so engineering yourself into a corner is never a good idea.
This approach also leaves no room for developer feedback because the system is already designed before the developer ever gets involved. It leaves no room for new technological innovations because it is impossible to predict what innovations will come in the future or when they will be sufficiently adopted to justify integration.
Koinos is not optimized for any high level feature (like “scaling”). Koinos is a blockchain-based protocol optimized to rapidly integrate the most innovative technologies as they emerge. Yes, this is fundamentally different than any other blockchain protocol in existence which makes it difficult for people to wrap their minds around its value. We are working hard to figure out better ways to communicate this value which is why we appreciate people asking these kinds of questions.
There are many interesting, important, and challenging problems that many amazing open source teams are working to solve. But the beauty of open source is that once those solutions exist, we all get to take advantage of them. We believe very much in the open source ethos and its power to deliver incredible innovations. We ourselves are working to deliver a very powerful open source solution that any developer can use to leverage the power of blockchain within their application.
Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) so many teams design their systems in ways that limit their ability to take advantage of the unlimited value that continuously emerges from the open source community.
The problem we are trying to solve is how to make those technologies available to blockchain developers the moment that they’re ready which also means using our expertise to assess whether a given technology is ready or not. It is far too frequently the case that developers will begin building on a solution long before it is ready simply because it claims to solve some important problem. This is incredibly risky for both themselves and their users. It is choosing to trust a (often anonymous) team when the whole point of decentralized solutions is to be trustless. A perfect example of this right now is the prevalence of cross-chain bridges. Very few, if any, of these are secure.
As the first, and flagship, implementation of Koinos the mainnet will be like an “innovation vacuum” sucking in the best technologies as they emerge and become secure. That will be the source of its value. Lots of people are working on scaling solutions, and as with any important feature, we are researching those solutions. Our goal will be to make all the best solutions available to Koinos blockchain developers, not pick any specific one and certainly not to develop one ourselves.
Developing novel solutions is a big red flag that either Koinos is not sufficiently flexible, or that no good solution already exists, meaning it’s an extremely difficult or impossible problem to solve. We’re not saying we won’t ever develop novel solutions, but our goal is to minimize them and ensure that those solutions increase the flexibility of Koinos while advancing our mission of accelerating the transition to a more decentralized future.
Far too often teams develop novel solutions as a marketing exercise which is not just a recipe for failure, it demonstrates a cynical world view that we do not share. We believe that people are ready for decentralized solutions that make their lives better. We’re focused on empowering developers to build those solutions and anything that distracts from that mission is unacceptable.

What about composability?
Now this is a question I can answer in a straightforward fashion (lol)! Koinos has the highest degree of composability possible because it is the only blockchain framework to move all of the system logic into smart contracts. When we’re talking about composability in the blockchain context, what we are talking about is the ability for decentralized application developers to repurpose code that is already running on the blockchain within their applications (i.e. to “compose” their applications).
Most blockchains that claim “high composability” are just saying that they don’t have sharding, which is an attempt to rebrand a limitation as a value-add. As I’ve explained ad nauseum, Koinos is optimized for flexibility which means that it could shard, or not shard, based on the smart contracts that are running on it.
As far as composability on Koinos, because all of the system logic is contained in smart contract modules, application developers will be able to not just repurpose the smart contracts written by other dApp developers, they’ll be able to repurpose the code written by the most experienced blockchain engineers in the world; the engineers building Koinos-based blockchains.
Mainnet will just be the first Koinos-based blockchain, so as more engineers launch more Koinos-based blockchains, even more system contracts will be running on Koinos giving dApp developers even more high quality smart contracts to draw from.
But wait there’s more! Because these smart contracts will be written in an ever growing number of the most used programming languages in the world, developers won’t just be able to find the perfect smart contract for their needs, they will be able to find smart contracts written in their preferred programming language! This takes the composability of Koinos, already far greater than any other protocol, to an entirely new level!

qqh6qd,My no.1 tip to find gems before anyone else,xrous1,1041,471,2021-11-10 00:12:18,"So, I'm sharing a secret tip of mine that I've used to make most of my gains this season.

**A technique I've refined to find amazing, under the radar Twitter profiles.**

Because in my opinion, following the correct accounts on Twitter can have a huge benefit to your success in this space.

I'm not talking about huge influencers. I'm talking about those insane, under the radar accounts with a few thousand followers who are just freaks at finding gems.

**So, here's how.**

When you come across a project/coin that has done incredibly well, search the $Cashtag in Twitter (e.g. $PILOT), but then select the three dots in the top corner for 'Advanced Search.'

In the advanced search, re-enter the $Cashtag in the top field and then scroll to the bottom to find 'Dates.' Here, you can select an exact date range to refine your search!

**The important part: choose dates before a coin started to blow up.**

For example, search $PILOT and select the date range October 10, 2021, to October 15, 2021.

The result?

You'll find whoever was talking about PILOT before it blew up. These are people who had conviction before anyone else (and even enough conviction to post about on Twitter about it).

You can now follow these accounts and wait for the next project they talk about.

You'll end up finding the most amazing accounts who will provide the alpha going forward.

**EDIT: Then you DYOR on these projects!! I'm not saying ape blindly into whatever they call next haha, it's a starting point for finding new projects then commencing your own research.**

Lastly, some of these smaller accounts have Telegram or Discords in their bio, so you can interact with them directly. This lets you dive even deeper.

qtmfnw,A shortish breakdown on GET Protocol's usecase and product,Jeronemoo,15,59,2021-11-14 09:38:06,"# Introduction

You've seen GET Protocol mentioned here and there, perhaps you've heard about their mission to become the worldwide protocol standard for ticketing, heck you might've used them unknowingly when you went to an event (like Cosmoverse) lately. There's people enthousiastic about GET Protocol and using it, but you don't really know what they do. In this post I'm going to give you a quick overview of the problems they aim to solve and their solution.

* Do note that there's much more to tell, but then it wouldn't be quick anymore.
* There's a few links I like to share but they seem to get autodeleted so I'll post them in a comment.
* Summary at the bottom for those that dislike large posts.

# Which industry is GET Protocol aiming for?

GET Protocol is aiming at disrupting the Ticketing Industry. The Ticketing Industry is basically comprised of event organisers, fans/customers, ticketeers, venues, and, regretfully, scalpers as well.

>The goal of the Ticketing Industry is to get the fan/customer to buy a ticket to visit an artist or other event, spending money at the venue if applicable.

There's a primary market and secondary market for tickets. The primary market is the market where the event organiser controls the ticket price by selling through ticketeers, while the secondary market is the market where tickets are resold by would-be attendees and ~~scalpers~~ ticket touts.

# Which problems does the Ticketing Industry face?

Ever bought a ticket to a famous artist or event? You stood in the digital queue for half an hour with no success, only to read the newspaper later on saying ""Artist X tickets sold out within 2 minutes!"". You take to secondary market options and what do you know, hundreds if not thousands of tickets available for you to purchase for that famous artist or event! There's just this tiny footnote however; The tickets have at least trippled in price. Furthermore, you don't even know if the ticket you bought is valid or not!

[We've all been there at least once. Scalpers are the scum of the Ticketing Industry.](https://preview.redd.it/3yybpx107jz71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=30edaa8d6d51efed839549518a25d9070b2220dd)

While scalping and fake tickets are already massive problems on their own, it turned out certain ticketeers themselves have joined the scalper side of things. It turned out Ticketmaster (one of the, if not the, biggest ticketeer known) collaborates with ticket touts, giving them a percentage of the tickets to sell on the secondary ticket market. That means a certain percentage of tickets for an event were **never even up for sale on the primary market**. This lack of transparancy is yet another issue the Ticketing Industry faces.

On the other side of the Ticketing Industry sit the venues and event organisers. Since the secondary market is basically a free-for-all, venues and event organisers (i.e. artists) do not know who bought tickets on the secondary market. This means there's no connection between venues/artists and customers/fans, which in turn means the venues/artists don't know who their audience is and if the right people are reached. This lack of insight is less apparent for ticketbuyers, but nonetheless an issue the Ticketing Industry faces.

Although the above is quite substantial already and there's much more going on, I'll go with one last issue to keep this brief; Merch selling at venues. Artists are the ones doing the work, the ones fans/customers come to an event for. These artists often sell merch at the venues. What you probably don't realise is that the venue takes a large piece of the merche income for allowing the artist to sell merch at the venue. Depending on the artists and piece taken, this could mean a serious cut in income for the artist.

While scalping, fake tickets and lack of transparancy take the bulk of it, all in all there's a lot askew within the Ticketing Industry.

# How does GET Protocol aim to solve these?

GET Protocol itself is, well, a protocol. This protocol is basically an ecosystem the tickets dwell in, tickets can never leave the ecosystem. How they create that ecosystem is written below under ""Grant insight in the secondary market"".

>The GET Protocol is the backend using blockchain technology to register and verify ownership of a ticket and provide transparency to the ticketing cycle.

The protocol uses the $GET token as fuel for any interaction with the blockchain; buying, selling, reselling, scanning, claiming or invalidating a ticket. This ensures a common way of interacting with the protocol no matter where the ticketeer is from. There's a bunch of other benefits to the token, but I won't go into them here.

The protocol combines a bunch of techniques to provide transparancy, make scalping impossible, make fake tickets impossible, grant more insight in the secondary market and do something about merch income cuts. Let's go at them one by one.

**Provide transparancy**  
Blockchain itself provides much needed transparancy. After all, every transaction is visible to everyone. Apart from that the protocol aims at providing transparancy wherever it goes.Take queueing for example. While usually you have no idea whether or not the queue was created fairly, with GET Protocol you can verify it thanks to their integration of Chainlink's VRF which provides verifiable randomness.Another example is their ticket explorer, that gives you real time insight in the ticket statistics. Or their subgraph that lets you query the protocol usage in-dept.

**Make scalping & fake tickets impossible**  
By linking a ticket to a SIM card and phone, the genuine owner of a ticket can be verified. GET Protocol combines this with a dynamic QR code to prevent selling the ticket outside their ecosystem, thus avoiding ticket fraud. This solves the fake ticket problem as well; there's simply no way to (re)sell a ticket other than through their ecosystem.

**Grant insight in the secondary market**  
This is an important one because it's a result of the ecosystem GET Protocol created. By merging the primary market and secondary market together, the GET Protocol closed ecosystem is created. Both markets are regulated by the protocol and while there's a distinction between the markets, the tickets gained from both markets are **exactly the same**.

Since the secondary market is an integrated part of the closed ecosystem, the protocol (and therefore the event organisers and venues) knows who a ticket has been resold to.

**Do something about merch income cuts**  
Since the tickets are fully digital and provide a 'right of entrance', merch can be sold alongside a ticket to an event. That's what's called upsells. By allowing fans/customers to buy merch as upsells you not only remove the need of selling at the venue, but also the issue of limited merch.

# Some more added value, a little thing called NFTs

Besides a way to solve existing issues, the protocol also aims at adding extra value to the ticketing usecase. A big example of that is NFT ticketing. Every ticket sold through the protocol is an NFT and can be claimed after the event. Besides being able to now claim a digital collectible much like you could with traditional paper tickets, this also opens new possibilities.

One of these is the ability to buy and sell your tickets, which you can do on the opensea market. Certain events, certain seatnumbers, might be worth something after the event. In fact, the ticket itself may have some added value after the event.

NFT tickets open up a lot of possibilities for fan<>artist interactions. Think about randomly making a few out of all event tickets have special perks like VIP access. Think about airdropping a special NFT among the attendees during the event. Think about giving free merch or discounts to those with multiple NFTs of a given artists, or even a backstage pass for the biggest fans.

An event ends after you went home, but with NFT tickets this doesn't have to be the end of your experience. Your NFT ticket could give you access to a metaverse event for example. Evolving NFTs is another prime example. Imagine going to a beer festival and getting an evolving NFT. Besides it evolving depending on the beers you drink, it could also further evolve when you go to another beer festival that accepts the same NFT!

The possibilities for NFT tickets are endless. If you wish to know more about this specific usecase (news, other projects), I highly recommend checking out the subreddit ""NFTTickets"".

# GET Protocol's solutions

While the protocol itself works as the backend, the team behind GET Protocol has thought about ways for ticketeers to easily implement this backend. They have created 2 products; one aimed at new ticketeers and ticketeers seeking a full package, the other at existing ticketeers wishing to dip their toes in fully digital NFT tickets.

**White Label (WL)**  
The WL solution is a full package build on top of the protocol. It consists of an android&iOS app, payment system, dashboards, and ofcourse all the benefits that come with the GET Protocol. It's a full package that allows the integrator to immediately start selling tickets.

The app is created in such a way that ticket buyers and sellers don't need to know a single thing about the blockchain or crypto to buy a ticket. So while the protocol works with the $GET token, ticket buyers just pay with fiat. On the other side of things are the dashboards where integrators can see a bunch of statistics, but also need to top up on $GET as fuel for their tickets. Any need for blockchain/crypto knowledge is removed here as well; Integrators top up with fiat and just see a bunch of fuel and how many tickets they can issue with that fuel.

There's multiple WL integrators, but the most well known is GUTS Tickets. Based in the Netherlands, but having issued events across the globe.

**Digital Twin (DT)**  
The DT solution is a non-invasive product that can exist alongside a ticketeer's existing infrastructure. All it takes is a few lines of code to call the DT API, that's all. With it, a ticketeer can create a digital NFT copy of their own issued (paper) tickets. It's a way for existing ticketeers to dip their toes in the NFT world. There's more features coming to the DT when requested, but since it's relatively new this digital copy is the first start.

Since it's relatively new there's a single DT active right now; YourTicketProvider. Based in the Netherlands, they sell about 2 million tickets yearly. Another one that's been announced to join EOY is eTicketaBlanca in Columbia.

# Open Invitation for NFT events

To showcase the power of NFT tickets and show the world how powerfull the system is that GET Protocol has build, they've recently extended an open invitation to ticket NFT events from now til the end of Q2 for free. If you wish to host an NFT event after seeing how succesful NFT.NYC has been, be sure to contact them!

# Summary

To summarise what we've iterated over:

* The ticketing Industry encompasses event organisers, ticketeers, venues, fans/customers and regretfully ticket touts.
* Ticket touts (scalpers) and big ticketeers like Ticketmaster weaponise the relation between you and the artist, extracting money out of the process without adding anything of value themselves.
* GET Protocol has created a protocol that uses blockchain and other smart technologies to tackle the problems the Ticketing Industry face, as well as add new value to the ticketing usecase like NFT ticketing.
* GET Protocol has created 2 products on top of the protocol to ease the onboarding of new and existing ticketeers.
* To showcase the power of NFT ticketing, an open invitation ticket NFT events for free has been extended til the end of Q2 2022.
* While this post has gone into the benefits GET Protocol offers to the ticketing usecase rather extensively, it hasn't touched upon the tokenomics side of things. If you wish to know more about that be sure to check out the faq in the comments, or just ask your questions below this post.

qybjmp,Let your tokens do the talking at MoonTrust (crypto chat app),Tennis-Money,23,19,2021-11-20 18:26:40,"[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moontrust/)

MoonTrust recently released their app, which is basically a crypto token payments platform with friends list, private chat, and group chat features like Telegram/Discord.

youtube video: [https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE](https://youtu.be/Od5naDvMNZE)

**What is MoonTrust?**

Just this year alone, tens of thousands of tokens were created. Most of these token communities were built through Telegram and Discord. Often when new potential investors join these communities, they are misled by the information within the chat channels. This is done by employing bots to hype the project and create traction. Some also employ real humans as moderators who do not even own the token. MoonTrust is a platform to enhance the community by making sure everyone is fully transparent with each other.

**MoonTrust Group Chat Feature**

In MoonTrust only token holders are allowed to chat, and it will show the actual holding amount at the time of the message. Users are also able to create custom chat channels with customizable token holding requirements. This will help community managers manage their “dolphin” and “whale” holders. MoonTrust system will automatically remove holders who no longer meet the token requirements.

**MoonTrust Payments and Friends**

MoonTrust also supports payments between friends. When transferring tokens between friends, you no longer need to remember their public address. Simply find your friend using their unique username and send or request as you would just like Venmo. Final confirmation is done via your software wallet. MoonTrust also supports private messaging between friends. Users can also find common tokens held between each other. This allows users to find new friends who have similar token interests.

**MoonTrust Privacy**

Although MoonTrust offers multiple privacy options for its users, they do not have privacy options for group chat transparency. Group chats are meant to be public and to prevent manipulation. Anyone who chats in group chats will have their token holding value displayed (only for that specific group chat).

**How Can MoonTrust Benefit Token** **Holders?**

MoonTrust group chat system is a heavily needed system in a space where there are tons of rug pulls making headlines every week. Scammers like to airdrop phishing/scam tokens to random address, but with MoonTrust, the community can warn each other in the specific token group chats. Projects that create fake hype by employing influencers, shillers, or bots, will also be exposed with this chat system. Currently, it is also common that communities are managed by mods who do not own tokens in various Telegram and Discord project groups. These mod services are typically paid in stablecoins, ETH, BNB or BTC, but never the specific project token. In MoonTrust, these types of situations will not happen as holders' token value is displayed and only holders can moderate each other. Any bots or scam offenders banned in MoonTrust will have a direct cost of business to scam groups via gas fees of specific blockchains. Currently banning scammers or bots in Telegram or Discord is free. Malicious actors can easily create thousands of accounts. However, in MoonTrust users can only enter a chat group if they have the tokens. This means for every new account, malicious groups need to send tokens to that address, thus costing them money. MoonTrust is dubbing this “Proof of Gas” mechanism. Just imagine the cost of business for these scam groups when using MoonTrust for the ETH chain.

**Upcoming Features**

The MoonTrust team is not stopping with their current iteration of the app. They are also working on a governance and moderation mechanism. The goal is to allow token holders to ban/mute each other based on their stake in the project. For example, a whale can ban a small fish, but if enough fish and dolphins team up, they can also remove whales. Although the MoonTrust App works on mobile devices, the MoonTrust team is also working on iOS and Android apps to improve user interfaces and user experience. They are working on new designs to better suit the viewing and usage experience of mobile devices.

**Upcoming Multiple Blockchain Support**

The MoonTrust project is aiming to launch its platform across all blockchains that have token projects built in them. The MoonTrust team is targeting one blockchain launch per year. Their platform launch for Cardano, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Avalanche are currently in the works.

r6ppkw,IOTA - Why I think they have completely reinvented themselves and we will see a nice Pamp within the next 24 hrs.,RetireTotheMOon,1,13,2021-12-01 21:28:48,"  

*TLDR: There is a pump coming. IOTA and the IOTA Foundation is not the same that it was before mid-2020. We are seeing a totally new token, a new Foundation, most importantly a new team!*

Here are my thoughts on why we will see a huge Pump and potentially nice consistent gains over the next month with IOTA.

1. It has been confirmed that there will be a big announcement in the next 24 hours. As well, that the IF has been working on this for the past 18 months. This was stated by Dominik Shiener, one of the founders of IOTA and on the Board of Directors. 

2. Why will this announcement be different from the “Q” announcement from years ago? Primarily I believe that the IOTA Foundation has evolved (in a positive way) from the early days. They were known for hype without any results. They talked-the-talked but never walked the walk. The “Q” announcement was a dud and really hurt the IF’s image and reputation, especially to investors and traders. The fact was that “Q” was a great idea, but it was built on Ternary and required Ternary hardware. Will we one day see Ternary IoT Hardware chips? Maybe, probably in 10 to 20 years, though possibly never. Building “Q” was a disaster but was pushed by two particular IOTA Founders at that time. Since the IF let go of those two founders that held so strongly to Ternary development in denial that it is destined to fail, Dominik Shiener and the IOTA Foundation as a whole, has completely rebuilt the Tangle from the ground up. They didn’t just rebuild and reinvent the Tangle with Chrysallis on a technical basis, but they also rebuild the IOTA Foundation as a whole. They reinvented how they conduct marketing, announcements, and interact with the community. Saying all that, Dominik himself confirmed today that this announcement within the next 24 hours will not be anything like “Q”. On top of that, he reaffirmed that the IOTA Foundation is nothing like it was in 2018 such as with the “Q” days. I do believe they have learned from their past, let go of some of the dead weight, reinvented themselves, yet they still hold true to the vision of building a feeless, secure, and decentralized network (trilemma solved!), but a network that not only supports the growing IoT Machine economy, but also a network that takes DLTs to the next level with Web/Crypto 3.0. This announcement has been confirmed it will not be another “Q” disaster. I will make the bet that it is a chance to show the result, and will have the fact to back that statement up, “IOTA has grown and not the same foundation it was when it made the “Q” announcement”.

3. There are times when Fundamentals (ie: technology releases, partnership announcements, etc.) align with Technical Analysis. Lately, I have seen a lot of Crypto Twitter traders stating they see inverse head-and-shoulders and a massive cup-and-handle. I’m no TA expert but I certainly know and understand the concept of network reach, especially when it comes to trading and price increases. Over the past two months, I have seen an explosion of Crypto Traders talking about IOTA and stating that it is poised for a big break-out. These profiles have 20k to 200k followers. Now that isn’t a lot compared to many of the big CT players, but it has basically gone from zero to several CT Traders with hundreds of thousands of followers. It does seem that this positive TA analysis of the IOTA chart aligns with a big fundamental announcement, and thus sets up a nice unicorn price pump moment. What I also believe, is that this announcement will show that the IF has evolved from the past days we all will know that with a factual event.

4. As with everything, Bitcoin is the King and leads all others. Is Bitcoin set up for a short-term break out in the next 72 hrs? Will it hold steady or take a huge dump? To me, it looks like it’s going sideways, or, a breakout has a higher possibility compared to dumping to low $40k’s. If it does breakout and aligns with good a TA breakout of IOTA, combined with a big fundamental announcement, this pump could be huge!

5. This can lead to consistent gains pushing IOTA through resistance levels. This certainly won’t be the last big announcement of the year. There is a high probability of the EBSI announcement dropping this month in December. EBSI, where the EU-Wide blockchain has signed a declaration to *“accelerate the creation of cross-border services for public administrations and their ecosystems to verify the information and to make services trustworthy”*. IOTA has already been accepted and chosen for round one. Any time now they will announce who will be chosen for round two. In round 2 the chosen participants will start working and developing the DLT system for the European Union. Further announcements and events that will happen, as we know staking within Firefly for the SMR token airdrop will happen soon and most likely in December. Additionally, the NFT auction will occur on December 20th. If these announcements and potentially others start dropping throughout December we could see a nice consistent price gain throughout the month as long as the market doesn’t suddenly crash and go bear.

6. Lastly, why do I think we will see a big pump in the next 24 hours, when the announcement occurs and potentially the pump evolves into just a nice price gain throughout the month, liquidity has and will keep drying up on the exchanges. It was already announced that IOTA is building the Shimmer Network and will airdrop SMR tokens to IOTA holders through a liquid staking process. Essentially the Shimmer network is identical to Kusama is to Polka Dot. As we know, Kusama’s price has had a 10,000% increase since its creation. Regardless of if anyone thinks a testnet token should have value, or logically should have value, Kusama has clearly shown that this market will give a testnet token value. There is no reason to think SMR tokens won’t have value either. The great thing about it, you can get SMR tokens free simply by holding and doing liquid staking with IOTAs. The key point here regarding liquidity is that people must stake their IOTAs within the Firefly wallet, *“Off the exchanges!”* There has already been an exodus of IOTAs off of exchanges and each day we move closer to staking the more liquidity will dry up. This of course leads to a squeeze and raises the price as when people try to buy IOTA there isn’t anyone selling. This also adds to the support to the thought of a sustained and consistent price increase throughout December.

Personally, I am an IOTA holder and have been since 2017. I trade (poorly.. lol) with 20% of my IOTA holdings. The token doesn’t do much day-to-day, but during these moments, where TA aligns with a good tangible announcement, that is when a huge pump occurs. This could also be like the 2017 moment where IOTA simply goes parabolic and shoots up into the top 10. Are the stars aligning for such a move? Not sure about that one, but a decent pump nonetheless. 

I hold IOTA (and soon SMR) for the fundamentals and their ambition to solve a problem despite the challenge. I really do love the vision of a feeless DLT, more so because they are building it while no one else is even trying. It’s a big challenge that brings huge risks for sure. Many may have given up when the Ternary failed. Yet the IOTA Team and community had the fortitude to get up and keep fighting. They didn’t stop when the challenges or failure arrived, they overcame and pushed forward where others threw in the towel. The IOTA Foundation, the leaders, the developers, the project managers, administrators, the marketing team, and the design team; are the team that is crawling through the mud, swimming upstream, and moving forward despite hate and anger being thrown their way daily in social media. They are the team fighting the trilemma war. Their endurance and ambition as an organization are like a few others. It’s that extreme determination within a team that changes society and makes history. Gates, Jobs, Bezos, Brin, Sage, Tomlinson, Newcomen, Savery, and Watt; changed society not just with a vision, but by completing that vision with a team that pushed through adversity and overcame failure. The *“new”* IOTA Foundation is one of those teams, and that is why I hold and have faith that they indeed will solve the trilemma. The Tangle & ShimmerNet will be the basic protocol for governments, global corporations, and a network that spans the earth. It will be a feeless network entangled allowing other fee-based blockchains & DAGs to interact with interoperability and most importantly, be able *to scale*! The Tangle will not be the only DLT that is for sure, but it will certainly be one of the major ones.

The major criticism of IOTA and the IF is that they don’t produce. I can agree with that with their past actions up to mid-2020. Until mid-2020 there really weren’t many facts to argue that stance, not much of anything was tangible or any technology really worked. However, since 2020 the IF has shown they have taken a new course. They have listened to the crypto community experts and admitted their technological faults. They reinvented their protocol while reinventing the way they interact with partners and the community, and more importantly, they did this transition from the top down. The leaders that wouldn’t follow the plan were let go. The leaders that stayed have led by example. Today there is an IOTA Devnet 2.0 based in binary, without a coordinator, running day-to-day without fees but also maintaining speed, security, and decentralization. The mainnet was transitioned from Ternary to Binary with UTXO’s to allow for present-day use! The IOTA Smart Contract Protocol was released as an Alpha version. Not only does it work, but it allows for Metamask integration and NFT drops completed *“ZERO FEES”*; this was completed and proven by IOTAbots. Currently, the fact that backs up the statement that Dapps can now be built using the Devnet2.0 and Smart Contracts, we this by Dapps such as: a Defi Exchange is being built by Tangle Sea (TangleSea.com) & Tangle Swap (https://tangleswap.exchange), an NFT market place ([https://nftiota.org](https://nftiota.org/)), IoT Sensors (Oracles) that payout to owners ([https://govs.io](https://govs.io/)), the Alvarium Project by Dell and Intel ([https://www.lfedge.org/projects/alvarium/](https://www.lfedge.org/projects/alvarium/)) and so much more. Through the IOTA’s Foundation and the Community development, there is now a basis for the community and partners to build on. It’s no longer about what possibly can be done in the future, it’s about what can be done now.

There is no doubt that over the past year the IOTA Foundation reinvented everything from the technology to the organization itself. They have reinvented the protocol, marketing, PR, and simply their professionalism and attitude as to how they interact with the community and partners. Before they made announcements of partnerships and technology developments that went nowhere or simply didn’t work. This year's announcements show delivery. Partnerships are moving out of the Proof-of-concept stages and being executed. Technology developments are being implemented, work, and allow for Dapp development. The facts back up these statements as we see with community Dapps (mentioned above), advancing out of Proof-of-Concept stages as we see with EBSI, Alvarium, Telco (TM Forum), Ensuresec, Trademark East Africa, EPCIS 2.0, and many other events currently progressing out of proof-of-concept stages. It’s these facts that support the new IOTA Foundation and its delivery. We aren’t seeing much anymore where VW builds a PoC but then doesn’t deliver anything. Now we are seeing partners build PoC’s and then move on to execution. That they don’t just talk-the-talk (as they did in previous years) but they are now back up the talk by walking-the-walk. I used to say, “next year will be the year for IOTA”. I said this each year since 2017… lol, but this year *“was”* the year for IOTA. This year they delivered and proved they have reinvented themselves with the specific focus of delivery and adoption. As they keep the current progress going every year will be the year for IOTA. They will keep delivering, PoC’s will be moving to execution, and the market adoption percentage will grow. As we have seen the broader community outside of the IOTA bubble start to change their sentiment towards IOTA and the Foundation. We see the broader community starting to trust the IOTA Foundation delivers on its promises. Now we see they believe the IOTA Foundation is walking a new path, one of delivery and adoption, we continue seeing more and more outsiders see this new view and start supporting IOTA and SMR. It won’t just be developers and partners supporting the tokens but also crypto traders and investors. I am looking forward to tomorrow’s announcement, the month of December as a whole, as well as next year. It’s not just exciting to see developments and delivery in Real-time, but I also love getting Free SMR Tokens from the Airdrop!!!

It’s special because it will be the first and only fully interoperable smart contract platform. Smart contracts use CosmWasm and are written in Rust and Go.

Features include IBC enabled smart contracts, high performance scaling thanks to Tendermint, an interoperable token and access to the Cosmos ecosystem.

It’s not built on Cosmos, it was developed using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. It means that the devs could focus on the application rather than reinventing a blockchain to deploy. It also means JUNO is a part of the Cosmos ecosystem and enjoys interoperability with the IBC gang.

There are many incentives to get involved early, aside from the low mc and impressive utility.

Juno just launched JunoMint, which will create abundant opportunities in airdrops of new coins for stakers in the Juno community. 
Juno just launched JunoSwap, and announced a new token for Liquidity Pool rewards called RAW which will be dropping soon.
Juno has a new Dao creation tool called DaoDao, accessible through DaoDao.zone, making it extremely accessible to create your own Dao.

It’s easy to get involved. Buy any IBC compatible coin (Atom, SCRT, Terra), send it to Keplr (wallet.Keplr.app), connect Keplr to Osmosis, app.osmosis.zone, deposit whichever coin you purchased onto Osmosis, and then swap it for Juno. Once you have Juno, you can either join an LP directly on Osmosis, or withdraw Juno into Keplr and then connect your Keplr to a site like juno.omniflix.co or disperze.juno.network where you can vote on governance and stake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/sc7th8/the_new_smart_contracts_on_the_block/,2,1,1,ATOM,positive

suo68a,A newbies quick guide for navigating crypto,Pleasuredinpurgatory,58,21,2022-02-17 12:55:51,"I know so much more now than when I first started about 11 months ago. I thought it would be cool to share some shortcuts for other people who are in the same boat as me.

1.When sending a large transaction(everything is relative!), always make a test transaction first. Everybody knows to double-check the wallet address and chain but we’re humans and bound to make mistakes. I’ve messed up my transactions before so now I always do a test (transferring a tiny amount of money first) for big transactions.

2. Bookmark exchange sites to avoid fake sites. People can buy ads so that their copycat site shows up above the real site. This is especially common in google ads. Don't click those ads for exchanges or defi projects!

3. Sites like [CoinMarketCap](https://pasteboard.co/OtGvNYjzTUeV.png) and [DropsEarn](https://dropsearn.com/airdrops/) have a list of free airdrops you can apply for. There are contest/giveaway airdrops and then there are ""use our protocol"" airdrops. Understand the difference before you get your hopes up. For contest/giveaways you simply need to follow a few social media accounts plus a retweet to qualify.

4.Crypto screener sites can help you find new trading opportunities or confirm whether your positions are strong or not. I like to use [CoinRotator](https://www.coinrotator.app/) because it settles on a position (buy, sell, or hodl) by comparing the coin’s performance against BTC, ETH and USDT. I used it to exit a few of my lucky winners from earlier in the year on AXS and SOL.

5. Scams are happening all the time so stay alert always. This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/quvhd5/are_you_a_crypto_newbie_heres_an_updated_list_of/) I saw a while ago details many of them. These scams can range from someone downloading an old livestream from Coinbase, Apple, Binance, huge huge names, then stream it on their Youtube/Facebook account; to random Redditors dm-ing you saying they were impressed by how smart and knowledgeable your Reddit posts/comments are and they want to work with you.

Some of the tips are probably common sense but who knows. We learn by teaching. Perhaps you have some tips to share with others as well. Not every post needs to be about new coins or calling out scammers.

Now, most often the airdrop bag contains only .1% = I'm wondering if 1% is overkill? Open ended question and I'm open to discussion on the matter. 

I have said in fairness there's no essentially harm in distributing max bags between small trusted teams, be it 1 to 2% of max supply, but the alternative here is those who by utilizing same or similar method and rug. So it's a hard one to talk about if it comes out in chat (people come to their own conclusions typically regardless of facts). I'm debating steering clear, I don't know..

I'm not sure at what point crypto investors will ever be satisfied before learning to trade properly, but it sure is refreshing to see a push for team doxxing and KYC.

Most crypto assets have updated their all-time high, showing users an unprecedented bullish rally. This situation has prompted millions of new traders to jump on the bandwagon and get their piece of the pie. Nevertheless, such a sharp growth was followed by an equally sharp fall. Such a scenario is usual for the crypto market. By opening the price chart of the same Bitcoin, you will see that the market is cyclical and constantly experiencing ups and downs. However, what we call a bear market is a challenging psychological time for traders and investors. How can you compensate for losses or even make a profit in a bear market? Let’s look at it in today’s article.

https://preview.redd.it/400bv8i9vhb91.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d538a2265785c86f0044890761ecc685ee5cd88

### What Is a Bear Market?

A bear market is a decrease in asset quotations by at least 20% from recent highs. During this period, there is a panic in the market, sales volumes are increasing, and opponents of cryptocurrencies rejoice that the bubble has burst. Inexperienced traders are especially susceptible to herd instinct, so they close their positions. However, a bearish period is the best time to enter the market and diversify your portfolio. By opening the Bitcoin price chart, you will see that its price is growing yearly, despite periods of decline. The trader needs to be patient, get certain skills, and wait for the trend reversal.

### How to Earn Crypto in a Bear Market?

**Investing**

When Bitcoin reached its price peak in 2021, many traders thought with chagrin, “I should have bought.” Now, when the market is in a bearish phase, there is an excellent opportunity to buy tokens of various crypto projects. The “buy the dip” strategy is among the most popular for many investors. For some, this “rule” is even the principal investment strategy. The expression “Buy the Dip” has a weighty justification — the market is constantly growing. With rare exceptions (both by assets and by periods), it is. Investing more when the price decreases will be advisable if any asset has a steady uptrend. Treat it like a discount purchase. However, it is not necessary to buy up all the assets.

* Invest in reliable, time-tested projects that have a solid foundation. For example, Bitcoin, which is an indicator of the market, has a robust community, is massively used as a means of payment, and so on. Or Ethereum, which is already the most popular platform for launching Dapps, and with the launch of Ethereum 2.0, considerable increases in price are possible.
* Study the project team, the level of execution of goals provided in the roadmap, and long-term plans. How accurately developers adhere to their plans is one of the indicators of success. In addition, analyze whether the project has enough funds to survive the bear market. Study tokenomics, the prices of private and seed rounds, and the token release schedule.
* Invest in tokens of projects produced in trending directions. Study profitable areas that accumulate large amounts of money. For example, GameFi applications are becoming more and more popular.

There is a crucial detail in the “buy the dip” strategy. It is not worth investing all the funds at once because we are never exactly sure when the price will push off and go up. Therefore, we recommend using the DCA strategy (dollar-cost averaging). DCA involves gradually entering the asset, namely purchasing equal parts with a specific frequency. This means that instead of depositing all the funds into the asset in one payment, you divide them into several pieces and invest them in the asset according to a specific schedule.

Let’s say we have $1000 and assume that the bearish trend will last about a year. We divide our $1000 by the number of weeks per year and invest about $20 weekly in the desired asset.

As a result, our investments will have a long-term character during the bear market, which should allow us not to miss the moment of the beginning of an uptrend and reduce the risks when entering an asset during a downtrend at the same time.

**Short-selling**

Short-selling is a classic strategy of bears, i.e., traders who want to make money on price reduction. The bear purchases a crypto asset on credit, pays a commission and interest on this loan and disposes of the funds received at its discretion. For example, Bob borrows an asset from the exchange and sells it at the current price of $2000. After a week, the asset drops by 20%, Bob buys the asset for $1600 and returns it to the exchange with interest (for example, $5) and commission (for example, $2). The remaining $393 is his profit. Within the framework of crypto exchanges, two tools allow traders to short-sell cryptocurrency:

* Margin trading. The essence of this method is the ability to borrow assets from an exchange/broker and make more expensive transactions. Accordingly, margin trading makes it possible to earn more on transactions.
* Futures is a contract between two bidders to buy/sell a certain asset at a certain time at a price specified in the contract. Futures contracts are divided by delivery dates into quarterly and perpetual futures contracts.

Margin and futures trading allows you to increase profits by using leverage.

**Deposits**

Crypto exchanges strive to have as many users as possible place their funds with them. This allows exchanges to increase liquidity and use cryptocurrency for other purposes. In addition, during the bear market period, users can earn income and not just leave their assets out of work.

Deposits come with a fixed or floating interest rate. In return, users receive a portion of the crypto exchange’s income — the principle is the same as that of banks.

The yield is constantly changing for floating-rate deposits and can be higher and lower compared to fixed-rate deposits. However, the latter has one caveat — interest is accrued only after the end of the selected period, but the longer the period, the higher the yield.

**Lending**

Lending implies a relatively high income, from 12-15% APR. Depending on the exchange, the lending percentage can be set independently, and loans can be provided at a fixed rate.

There are centralized lending platforms (Nexo, Crypto.com) and decentralized (Maker, Compound, Aave).

Decentralized financial platforms (DeFi) are considered more secure, but their interest rates are lower than those of centralized ones. Therefore, using DeFi to take out cheap loans and then provide them at higher rates on centralized sites is advantageous.

**Farming (liquidity mining)**

Farming is a new form of income generation in cryptocurrency, which came to us from DeFi.

Liquidity mining means that investors act as liquidity providers (LP). They supply liquidity to the platforms and earn a portion of exchanges trading fees. For their support, they also receive LP tokens that can be used to generate passive income.

As in the case of loans, the yield varies depending on the total volume of the liquidity pool. The farming process is practically the same as lending, but with one caveat: not a separate cryptocurrency is added to the liquidity pool, but a pair. For example, ETH and USDT. Therefore, both cryptocurrencies should be on the wallet balance.

**Staking**

Staking (Proof of Stake) is an energy-efficient alternative to mining (Proof of Work). From the investor’s point of view, staking is an opportunity to place your savings in a bank (protocol) via a crypto wallet to receive a fixed income over time. For this, holders receive remuneration from the network up to 36% APR. In addition, this approach encourages investors to keep cryptocurrency as long as possible, which positively affects the exchange rate dynamics.

Two ways to stake cryptocurrency are by launching your node or delegating coins to validators.

The first method requires technical knowledge and is suitable only for those with a large amount to invest. But this way, you can increase profitability because other participants can vote for your node.

The second way is delegation. You do not need to install a node. It is enough to delegate coins to the network validators.

In addition to traditional staking, criticized due to the lack of liquidity, the DeFi sector allows us to get the most out of our tokens — liquid staking. With liquid staking, users can receive both staking rewards and any rewards received for using their tokens in DeFi apps. In fact, Liquid Staking provides a representative L-token in the same proportion as the user’s original token in exchange for placing its tokens in the corresponding protocol.

Thus, if you place an ATOM bet in the Persistence Protocol, you will receive a pATOM token in a proportion equivalent to the deposited ATOM assets. You can use these pATOM tokens in any DeFi protocol to generate more profit.

**Airdrop**

An airdrop is a wonderful tool that helps traders get tokens of various projects for free. During bear market periods, airdrops are a kind of bonus. Tokens of successful projects can significantly increase in price, which will help to cover the current losses somehow. Airdrops come in several types:

* Retroactive airdrop. The best and most exclusive type of drops in the entire field of cryptocurrencies, to get it, it is necessary to fulfill the conditions that the project lays out. For example, the airdrop of UNI tokens was conducted among users who used the Uniswap exchange at least once.
* Bounty airdrop. As part of the bounty program, the project lays out the conditions for participation in the program: subscribe to their social media, write about the project on your social media.
* Exclusive airdrop. Exclusive airdrops are usually given to those who supported the project in the early stages.
* Airdrop per hold. Also, projects carry out airdrops among those who keep a specific coin in their wallet.

w99ldd,The Prospects of a good investment even in the bear season.,funnyfunplusgo,13,21,2022-07-27 08:55:53," 

Since  the bear over the past couple of months, many have withdrawn  investments from the crypto space. The few more courageous ones may have  only managed to leave what was left of them in stable currencies like  USDT, USDC and BUSD. Hard times they say requires desperate measures,  this I very much understand.

Over  the course of my crypto journey, I have researched about several  opportunities that are available in the crypto space that can be  utilised in this bear period

I am  familiar with a few techniques from trading perpetuals, to getting into  newer projects as it appears people are dumping the older ones.

Decentralised  Finance(DeFi)  for passive incomes ranging from farming to staking to  airdrops seems to be another rewarding ecosystem this bear period. Some  of these DeFi platforms include Biswap, Nervos, Equilibrium and Fusotao.

Biswap  is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap tokens on  the BNB Smart Chain. Besides having a novel referral system and low  trading fees, Biswap also offers an assortment of products and services.

The  Nervos Network is an open source public blockchain ecosystem and  collection of protocols creating the foundation for a universal  internet-like public network.

Equilibrium  is a DeFi 2.0 platform on Polkadot. It has a money market and order  book DEX all in one ecosystem. The money market can be used for lending,  borrowing and earning on securing loans with pliable interest rates. On  the order book DEX, users can do margin trading with high leverage and  earn passively from the market making pools for liquidity providers.  While I liked the fair refferal rewards on Biswap and the awesome  staking rewards on nervos platforms, I must say I was much pleased by  the order book features of Equilibrium.

Fusotao  protocol is a verification protocol for orderbook-based matching system  using the paradigm of execute off-chain, verify on-chain. It is powered  by the decentralized infrastructure of Fuotao, a trust-free  orderbook-based matching systems with zero-cost gas and low latency.

As  it stands now, I just might begin to research on other similar novel  projects to add to the list above so as to put in my fair investments  for some good returns while also waiting for the the bull run.

I feel like most people are turned off by other chains because bridging is usually a pain in the ass. Either it takes a ton of time or the UI is garbage. I found relay the other day scrolling on twitter and figured I would write up a post on why it was the easiest for me in case anyone else is looking for a good bridge.

I had never really bridged anything until I randomly got included in the OP airdrop and wanted to bridge it over to main net.

It's called [Relay](https://bridge.relaychain.com/), you can bridge between pretty much any chain either L1 or L2. It is extremely fast and easy to understand.

First you connect your wallet and select which chains you want to bridge from, so let's say you are going from Optimism to Mainnet like I was I would just choose those two chains and then the asset I am trying to bridge and that's all.

Ethereum fork on PoW becomes mainstream, here’s why:

Chandler Guo announced his plan to hardfork the Ethereum blockchain “again” in July 2022. Previously, he was involved with the creation of Ethereum Classic's ETC cryptocurrency. Ethereum WorldWide uses a novel hardfork of the Ethereum codebase. This was created by 60 people — including miners, software developers, and analysts — in mid-September 2017.   


They were assembled to develop, maintain and promote the cryptoasset. ETHW is the name of the Ethereum hardfork's independent, censorship-resistant version. Many centralized crypto exchanges, wallets, and lenders currently support its token.

xe8y6u,Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Merger Implications on Other Cryptocurrencies Hypothesis,taurusresearch,1,2,2022-09-14 18:10:15,"Hi all,

would appreciate any feedback, criticism and projects you think I missed.

The below is research, not financial advice. This is a hypothesis of what may occur after the Ethereum merger. The research may be wrong or right only time will tell….

ETH 2.0 merge, is where it goes from Proof-of-work(POW) to Proof-of-Stake(POS) is scheduled to occur between End of day Sept 14th 2022 to early morning of Sept 15th 2022. Assuming all goes well, as there is always a chance of issue, but considering it has been in the works for years, hopefully all the bugs have been worked out.

The move to POS will render the ETH mining process and consequentially the equipment used for ETH mining obsolete for that specific network/ Cryptocurrency. Already seeing miners leave support for ETH network with \~-10% moving on from ETH to other networks as the table below indicates.  In the same time period of March 6, 2022 to September 14, 2022, BTC hash rate has gone up by \~33%, while the price of BTC has actually went down by \~-44%, which is a larger drop than ETH at \~-36%.

Allowing for potential opportunity, when/if the mining rigs get redirected to other projects. Hypothetically increasing the difficulty of other projects. Upon research having discovered 4 potential projects that may benefit from the merge, with increased mining difficulty, hash rate and therefore increase in cost. Leading to increased prices in the short to medium term.

The 4 projects currently being focused on are ETC(Ethereum Classic), ERG(ERGO), RVN(Raven Coin), FLUX(FLUX). Seeing that most of the coins below have increased in hash rate and price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h3uaooi97vn91.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=952507b03b8c2ce0c85deedffc8082ec429c007d

\*Price are from after Sept 13th 2022 CPI numbers when both the Stock and Crypto Markets plummeted.

There are many risk associated with this thesis, the 6 primary ones are.

1. Potential ETH POW airdrop fork, miners may go support it instead of the mentioned projects

2. Miners do not see these projects as profitable/worthwhile mining and shutoff for the time being

3. Miners do not see any projects now or in the future as worthwhile and sell equipment

4. Miners use algorithms that determine most profitable coin to mine, then sell the coin for the desired Cryptocurrency, creating more selling pressure. i.e mine ERG sell for ETH or BTC

5. Algorithms for miners do not determine these as worthwhile and no community generates for these coins, leading to no substantial change in hash rate or increased demand.

6. Even though it is most profitable, recent price spikes have already priced in increases in difficulty. Prices may fall after the merge.

Crypto listed on fewer exchanges have higher potential upside with listing on larger exchange usually brings with it a price bump

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfnu0z4b7vn91.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=521c715bced4f50f4395d540340223ae9b7ff95e

As can see below visually ETH hash rate has decreased while at the same time ETC has seen aggressive growth in the difficulty.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4g50cd6c7vn91.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=f201f2b7f0b6a5d53caf186710092355238f1e76

ETC because of the history of the project and familiarity to the current ETH project, being a good candidate for ETH maximalists, that want to support the ETH project vision. The risk is it has had the most growth and is the most popular project, with a ranking of #18 with a market cap of 5.05 Billion at with a max supply of 230 million at the time of writing.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zkhr6gfd7vn91.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d7c6ee868b2bafe2dc8cf721a40370b058a7c1

ERG is a light POW, approach to smart contracts in line with Bitcoin’s original concept, but with small additions. Ergo allows people to synchronise with the network by downloading less than a megabyte of data. Unlike ETC is a fairly unknown project. Being the lowest ranked project on CoinMarketCap  at 224th place with a market cap of .25 Billion with a max supply of 97 million at the time of writing.

FLUX is a POW minable coin, with the lowest hash rate among the researched coins still being in the mow mega hash range. Flux has a different objective than the other researched coins. It strives to be a decentralized WEB 3.0 infrastructure, use its Linux based cloud operating system FluxOS. Ranked 111 on CoinMarketCap with a Market Cap of 0.31 Billion and max supply of 440 million at the time of writing this.

RVN is an ASIC Resistant, POW coin. That is designed to be a Peer to Peer Electronic System for the Creation and Transfer of Assets. With the ability to mint NFTs, since March 6th has experienced the thirs largest increase in hash rate and price with 89% and 20% respectively. Ranked 61 on CoinMarketCap with a Market Cap of 0.66 Billion and max supply of 21 Billion at the time of writing this.

xop2nk,ETH 2.0 & Crypto Taxes,Free-Sale-1925,1,8,2022-09-26 17:00:29,"Ethereum recently switched to proof of stake. In general, staking rewards are treated as income, but there are other taxable events related to the Merge. Accointing.com has covered the tax implications for multiple countries listed below: 

### US

**Merge:** According to [**Question 30 of the IRS FAQs**](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) soft forks are not taxable events. While the merge is not technically a soft fork, the IRS states that “*A soft fork occurs when a distributed ledger undergoes a protocol change that does not result in a diversion of the ledger and thus does not result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency.*” Based on this definition and the outcome of the merge, it is safe to conclude that the merge is not a taxable event. 

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** Trading of ETH 2.0 would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

**ETH PoW:** This hard fork would be taxed based on the guidance of [**Rev. Rul. 2019-24**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf), as ordinary income based on the fair market value of the coins at the time the taxpayer obtains control.

**Staking Rewards:** as discussed above, while certainly ordinary taxable income, the timing of recognition of the income is not clear.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** Trading of staking rewards would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

### UK

**Merge:** HMRC have provided guidance for [**soft forks**](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto22300), and since there is no token or distributed ledger created, these are not taxable events. HRMC have also added a paragraph about the beacon chain merge in their [**One-Way transfers analysis**](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto22110). They state that [**TCGA92/S43**](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg17370#:~:text=TCGA92%2FS43,value%20of%20an%20asset%20%5BA%5D) applies to this type of transaction, which tells us that a portion of the cost from the original asset should go to the new asset. Since 100% of the cost of your ETH would be moved to ETH 2.0, it would appear that carrying over your tax basis to the ETH 2.0 is the right answer, with no taxable gain or loss. In other words, imagine that nothing happened, similar to a soft fork since no new token is created. 

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** Trading of ETH 2.0 would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

**ETH PoW:** Any [**airdrops**](https://hub.accointing.com/general-knowledge/crypto-basics/everything-about-crypto-airdrops-types-standard-bounty-holder-exclusive) of other coins forked (such as ETH PoW) would be treated under [**hard fork rules**](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto22300), which tell us to allocate a portion of our original tax basis to the new forked coins. 

**Staking Rewards:** Any staking income from staking ETH 2.0 would be treated the same as other staking income, miscellaneous income with the timing of recognition of this income undetermined.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** Trading or selling ETH 2.0 or rewards, would be subject to capital gains tax similarly to any other disposals of crypto assets. 

### Germany 

**Merge:** The [**BMF**](https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Web/DE/Home/home.html)  has not given much guidance for the Ethereum merge or for soft forks. Since 100% of the cost of your ETH would be moved to ETH 2.0, it would appear that carrying over your tax basis to the ETH 2.0 is the right answer, with no taxable gain or loss.  

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** Trading of ETH 2.0 would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

**ETH PoW:** This hard fork wouldn’t be taxable based on the [**guidance of the BMF**](https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/BMF_Schreiben/Steuerarten/Einkommensteuer/2021-06-17-est-kryptowaehrungen.html) but a portion of the original tax basis is allocated to the new forked coins and the acquisition date of the forked coins is the same as the original coins (ETH).

**Staking Rewards:** Any staking income from staking ETH 2.0 would be treated the same as other staking income, miscellaneous income with the timing of recognition of this income undetermined.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** Trading or selling ETH 2.0 or rewards, would be subject to capital gains tax similarly to any other disposals of crypto assets. 

### Australia 

**Merge:** The ATO has not given much guidance for the Ethereum merge or for soft forks. However, they have provided guidance on [**chain splits**](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investments-and-assets/Crypto-asset-investments/Crypto-chain-splits/#:~:text=A%20chain%20split%20occurs%20when,where%20their%20core%20rules%20diverge.), which is the term they have chosen for hard forks. Regardless of terminology, what is important is the definition and reasoning, a chain split produces a new asset (e.g., BTC > BTC + [**BCH**](https://www.accointing.com/integrations/bch)). Since the merge does not result in a new asset (ETH is still ETH), this would appear to be a nontaxable event where your cost basis in your ETH is simply carried over to the ETH 2.0 as if nothing had happened. 

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** Trading of ETH 2.0 would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

**ETH PoW:** For any coins that are a result of hard forks (such as ETH PoW), Australia does not tax chain splits either, rather you acquire the coins with a $0 cost basis, meaning that when you dispose of the assets, you will pay tax on 100% of the proceeds. 

**Staking Rewards:** The timing of the recognition of the staking rewards is also unclear, but the income is taxable as other income.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** Trading of staking rewards would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto trade. 

### Austria 

**Merge:** The Ministry of Finance in Austria has not given much guidance for the Ethereum merge or for soft forks. Since the merge does not result in a new asset (ETH is still ETH), this would appear to be a nontaxable event where your cost basis in your ETH is simply carried over to the ETH 2.0 as if nothing had happened. 

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** Trading of ETH 2.0 would result in taxable disposals no different than any other crypto to fiat trade.  

**ETH PoW:** This hard fork would not be taxed based on the guidance of the [**Ministry of Finance**](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10004570&FassungVom=2022-03-13&Artikel=&Paragraf=27b&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) in Austria and the cost basis would be $0. 

**Staking Rewards:** Staking rewards would not be taxed based on the guidance of the [**Ministry of Finance**](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10004570&FassungVom=2022-03-13&Artikel=&Paragraf=27b&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) in Austria and the cost basis would be $0.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** Trading of staking rewards would result in taxable disposals with a cost basis of $0 if disposed for fiat currencies.

### Switzerland 

**Merge:** As Switzerland does not impose a tax on capital gains, the merge is an irrelevant event for tax purposes, you will pay a tax based on the value of your portfolio at year end. 

**Trading of ETH 2.0:** As Switzerland does not impose a tax on capital gains, trading ETH 2.0 is not a taxable event, you will pay a tax based on the value of your portfolio at year end.  

**ETH PoW:** The hard fork is not a taxable event and not subject to income tax, you will pay a tax based on the value of your portfolio at year end. 

**Staking Rewards:** Any staking income from staking ETH 2.0 would be treated the same as other staking income and is taxable based on value when received.

**Trading of ETH 2.0 Rewards:** As Switzerland does not impose a tax on capital gains, trading ETH 2.0 rewards is not a taxable event, you will pay a tax based on the value of your portfolio at year end.
